As a result of alternative splicing, the total late mRNA population consists of about 5% mVP2 (no message body splice chosen), about 15% mVP3 (promoter-proximal 3' splice site chosen), and about 80% mVP1 (promoter-distal 3' splice site chosen). To determine whether it is splice site strength that determines the ratio of spliced products, constructs containing duplicated or rearranged 3' splice sites were created. In construct VP1,1, 160 bp surrounding the VP3 3' splice site was substituted with the corresponding region of the VP1 3' splice site. This construct resulted in the duplication of the VP1 3' splicing signal. VP3,3 (two identical VP3 3' splice sites) and VP1,3 (VP1 and VP3 3' splice sites reversed) were similarly created. Each construct maintained wild-type spacing between the 3' splice sites. Analysis of RNAs from transfections showed that in each construct, the 3' splice closest to the polyadenylation site was used preferentially. Analysis of a number of additional constructs indicated that there are no strong cis-acting positive or negative regulators of polyomavirus late splicing; rather, splicing choices appear to be determined largely by relative position of splice sites.</Abstract><MeSH>3T3 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Alternative Splicing</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Capsid</MeSH><MeSH>Capsid Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Mutational Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Rearrangement</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Polyomavirus</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Precursors</MeSH><MeSH>Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Transfection</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>spliced</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32380211"><Journal>Virus research</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Efficient production of HPV16 E2 protein from HPV16 late mRNAs spliced from SD880 to SA2709.</Title><Abstract>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) produce a large number of alternatively spliced mRNAs, including a number of differently spliced mRNAs with the potential to produce E2 protein.

OPG inhibits bone resorption and binds with strong affinity to its ligand RANKL, thereby preventing RANKL from binding to its receptor RANK. This system is regulated by calcium-modifying hormones. OPG may also be pivotal in modulating the immune system. RANKL-deficient mice exhibit both severe immunological abnormalities and osteopetrosis, and activated T cells express RANKL mRNA. RANKL secretion by activated T cells may induce osteoclastogenesis via a mechanism enhanced by several cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-17) that promote both inflammation and bone resorption. Conversely, this mechanism is inhibited by OPG, IL-4, and IL-10, which have antiinflammatory effects and inhibit osteoclast formation. Activated T cells in the rheumatoid synovium express RANKL. Synoviocytes can differentiate to osteoclast-like cells under specific conditions, particularly when they are cultured with M-CSF and RANKL. Thus, the bony erosions seen in RA may result from RANKL/RANK system activation by activated T cells. This raises the possibility that OPG therapy to block this mechanism might prove beneficial in patients with RA.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Arthritis, Rheumatoid</MeSH><MeSH>Glycoproteins</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Inflammation</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Osteoblasts</MeSH><MeSH>Osteolysis</MeSH><MeSH>Osteoprotegerin</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Its pathophysiology involves production of antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Patients with negative anti-acetylcholine receptors (AChR) antibodies results are recognized as seronegative myasthenia gravis. In this review we tried to compare surgical and medical management of MG with each other to find out which is more effective. Different clinical trials and retrospective cohorts comparing these two parameters statistically were searched and studied. Remission rates in both medical and surgical management were compared. We found out that rates of remission were better in post thymectomy patients than patients on various medical treatment options including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, intravenous immunoglobulins and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors alone. Hence thymectomy is studied to be the superior treatment option than other conservative medical management options alone.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Drosophila Frizzled (Fz), Starry night (Stan), Van Gogh (Vang), Dishevelled (Dsh), Prickle (Pk), Diego (Dgo) and Nemo (Nmo) are implicated in the PCP signaling pathway. Choi and Benzer identified Drosophila Nmo in 1994, and Brott et al identified mouse Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) in 1998. Nlk positively regulates the PCP pathway, and negatively regulates the beta-catenin pathway. Here, we identified and characterized rat Nlk gene, Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene by using bioinformatics. Nlk gene, consisting of 11 exons, was mapped to rat chromosome 10q25. Rat Nlk gene encoded 515-aa Nlk protein with the serine/threonine kinase domain, poly(His) tracts and poly(Ala) tract, which showed 100, 99.8, 97.1 and 89.5% total-amino-acid identity with mouse Nlk, human NLK, Xenopus nlk and zebrafish nlk, respectively. Rat Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene were mapped to rat chromosome 13p13 and 2q44, respectively. Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene, consisting of a single exon, were not evolutionarily conserved. Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene were predicted as retrotransposed Nlk homologs within the rat genome. Nlk2 gene encoded a 480-aa Nlk2 protein with partial deletion within the kinase domain, which was predicted as the dominant negative Nlk homolog. This is the first report on the Nlk gene and retrotransposed Nlk homologs within the rat genome.</Abstract><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Proteomics</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Esophageal and cutaneous manifestations may directly reflect the underlying disease process, as in infections such as herpes simplex virus, bullous diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa and mucous membrane pemphigoid, connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory diseases such as lichen planus. Alternatively, esophageal and cutaneous findings may result from conditions that are closely associated with and potentially pathognomonic for but distinct from the underlying disease process, as in genetic diseases such as Cowden syndrome or paraneoplastic syndromes such as acrokeratosis paraneoplastica. Other diseases such as Crohn disease may have cutaneous manifestations that directly reflect the same underlying inflammatory process that affects the gastrointestinal tract or cutaneous manifestations that represent reactive or associated conditions distinct from the underlying inflammatory process. The cutaneous manifestations of disease may precede, coincide with, or follow the esophageal manifestations of disease. The authors present the characteristic clinical features and imaging findings associated with common and uncommon conditions that have esophageal and cutaneous manifestations. Each condition is presented with a brief overview, discussion of salient clinical and cutaneous manifestations, and description of the typical esophageal imaging findings, with particular attention to implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Recognition of potential associations between cutaneous lesions and esophageal imaging findings is important for establishing a specific diagnosis or generating a meaningful differential diagnosis.</Abstract><MeSH>Diagnosis, Differential</MeSH><MeSH>Esophageal Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Paraneoplastic Syndromes</MeSH><MeSH>Prognosis</MeSH><MeSH>Skin Diseases</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>
