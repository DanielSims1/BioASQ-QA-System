Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes shrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early reports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to reduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor burden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional androgen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with single-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a combination study of orteronel with docetaxel. Recently, the ELM-PC5 Phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer who had received prior docetaxel was unblinded as the overall survival primary end point was not achieved. However, additional Phase III orteronel trials are ongoing in men with earlier stages of prostate cancer."

However, pannexins do not form gap junctions but operate as plasma membrane channels. The best-characterized member of these proteins, Pannexin1 (Panx1) was suggested to be functionally associated with purinergic P2X and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. Activation of these receptor channels by their endogenous ligands leads to cross-activation of Panx1 channels. This in turn potentiates P2X and NMDA receptor channel signaling. Two potentiation concepts have been suggested: enhancement of the current responses and/or sustained receptor channel activation by ATP released through Panx1 pore and adenosine generated by ectonucleotidase-dependent dephosphorylation of ATP. Here we summarize the current knowledge and hypotheses about interactions of Panx1 channels with P2X and NMDA receptor channels.

In this chapter, the HILIC enantioseparations carried out on polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases are grouped and discussed. Another objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview and insight into the experimental conditions needed to operate under HILIC mode. Finally, to stimulate and facilitate the application of this chromatographic technique, a detailed experimental protocol of a chiral resolution on a chlorinated cellulose-based chiral stationary phase under HILIC conditions is described."

However, the existence of multiple MAP kinases which phosphorylate similar phosphoacceptor motifs poses a problem in maintaining substrate specificity and hence the correct biological response. Both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) subfamilies of MAP kinases use a second specificity determinant and require docking to their transcription factor substrates to achieve maximal substrate activation. In this study, we demonstrate that among the different MAP kinases, the MADS-box transcription factors MEF2A and MEF2C are preferentially phosphorylated and activated by the p38 subfamily members p38alpha and p38beta2. The efficiency of phosphorylation in vitro and transcriptional activation in vivo of MEF2A and MEF2C by these p38 subtypes requires the presence of a kinase docking domain (D-domain). Furthermore, the D-domain from MEF2A is sufficient to confer p38 responsiveness on different transcription factors, and reciprocal effects are observed upon the introduction of alternative D-domains into MEF2A. These results therefore contribute to our understanding of signalling to MEF2 transcription factors and demonstrate that the requirement for substrate binding by MAP kinases is an important facet of three different subclasses of MAP kinases (ERK, JNK, and p38)."

Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by chromosomal translocations resulting in the formation of chimeric fusions between the EWS gene and transcription factors of the ETS family, such as EWS-FLI-1. The clinical outcome of Ewing's sarcoma remains poor, and novel therapeutic approaches are required. Proteomic analyses have been applied to identify the functions of the fusion gene product, and a novel mechanism of EWS-FLI-1 turnover has been proposed. Furthermore, proteomics has revealed the regulation of IL-6 secretion by EWS-FLI-1, which may promote malignant behavior in tumor cells. In addition, proteomic approaches have been used to assess the effects of unique genes and drugs on Ewing's sarcoma and to determine specific biomarker candidates for the prediction of drug resistance and recurrence. By identifying the proteins relevant to the molecular backgrounds of clinical characters of Ewing's sarcoma, we can understand the biology of Ewing's sarcoma and develop clinical applications. Fundamental research systems such as tumor cell and tissue biobanks and databases are required to make effective use of the limited clinical materials and promote research into Ewing's sarcoma."

Moreover, no study has examined the consequences of pharmacologically inhibiting Hh signaling in NKTCL cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the expression of Smoothened (Smo) and Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) in NKTCL tissue were scrutinized. Two human NKTCL cell lines, SNK6 and SNT8, were subjected to various doses of sonidegib (a Smo inhibitor) and incubated for distinct durations. The cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry, CCK-8 assay was run to assess proliferation, and protein levels were quantified by Western blotting. RESULTS Both Smo and Gli1 expression were higher in NKTCL tissue than in Lymphoid Reactive Hyperplasia (LRH). Sonidegib significantly suppressed proliferation in NKTCL cells and the effect was dose-dependent. Further analysis revealed that sonidegib treatment elevated the number of apoptotic cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, sonidegib downregulated Smo and Gli1expression in NKTCL cells. CONCLUSIONS The Hh pathway is crucial to the development of NKTCL and thus holds huge promise as a treatment for this disease."

Germline mutations in several genes with autosomal dominant (AIP, MEN1, CDKN1B, PRKAR1A, SDHx) or X-linked dominant (GPR101) inheritance are causative of familial pituitary adenomas. Due to variable disease penetrance and occurrence of de novo mutations, some patients harboring germline mutations have no family history of pituitary adenomas (simplex cases). Areas covered: We summarize the recent findings on the role of germline mutations associated with familial pituitary adenomas in patients with sporadic clinical presentation. Expert commentary: Up to 12% of patients with young onset pituitary adenomas (age at diagnosis/onset \u226430\u00a0years) and up to 25% of simplex patients with gigantism carry mutations in the AIP gene, while most cases of X-linked acrogigantism (XLAG) due to GPR101 duplication are simplex female patients with very early disease onset (<5\u00a0years). With regard to the syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), MEN1 mutations can be identified in a significant proportion of patients with childhood onset prolactinomas. Somatotroph and lactotroph adenomas are the most common pituitary adenomas associated with germline predisposing mutations. Genetic screening should be considered in patients with young onset pituitary adenomas."

Its popularity reflects the key features of the method: its applicability to a variety of sample types and the high quality of the released peptides. Successful application of FASP requires optimized properties of sample lysate and its amount, use of ultrafiltration units with membranes having large molecular mass cut-offs and well selected conditions for protein digestion. In contrast to the majority of sample preparation methods, FASP allows digestion of proteins with a variety of enzymes and a straightforward monitoring of protein-to-peptide conversion. A unique feature of FASP is the possibility to cleave proteins in a consecutive way using several proteases and to separate peptide fractions. Understanding principles of the method gives guidance in applying FASP to different types of samples in optimization of conditions of the FASP-workflow."

Methods We randomly allocated 27 departments from five hospitals in Denmark to a participatory intervention (14 clusters, 316 healthcare workers) or a control group (13 clusters, 309 healthcare workers). The intervention consisted of 2\u00d72 hour workshops with managers, the hospital's health and safety staff, and 2-5 healthcare workers from each department. Based on an assessment of barriers and solutions conducted prior to randomization, participants developed an action plan for implementing department-specific solutions for improving the use of AD. Use of necessary AD (using digital counters as primary outcome), and general use of AD (using accelerometers as secondary outcome), pain intensity in the low-back, work-related back injuries during patient transfer, and communication and guidance in the use of AD were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results Use of necessary AD (primary outcome), low-back pain, and back injuries did not change in the intervention compared with control group at 12-month follow-up. However, general use of AD measured with accelerometers as well as communication and guidance improved significantly in the intervention versus control group. Conclusion The intervention did not result in more frequent use of the necessary AD but led to more general use of AD, as well as increased communication and guidance."

Several studies have shown that various ECM proteins undergo proteolytic modification. In mammals, the extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known modifiers of the ECM, implicated in tissue architecture changes and the release of biologically active and/or signalling molecules. Although plant MMPs have been identified, little is known about their activity and function. Plant MMPs show structural similarity to mammalian MMPs, including the presence of an auto-regulatory cysteine switch domain and a zinc-binding catalytic domain. Plant MMPs are differentially expressed in cells and tissues during plant growth and development, as well as in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses. The few gene expression and mutant analyses to date indicate their involvement in plant growth, morphogenesis, senescence and adaptation and response to stress. In order to gain a further understanding of their function, an analysis and characterisation of MMP proteins, their activity and their substrates during plant growth and development are still required. This review describes plant MMP work to date, as well as the variety of genomic and proteomic methodologies available to characterise plant MMP activity, function and potential substrates."

Here, we report that SLP2 anchors a large protease complex composed of the rhomboid protease PARL and the i-AAA protease YME1L, which we term the SPY complex (for SLP2-PARL-YME1L). Association with SLP2 in the SPY complex regulates PARL-mediated processing of PTEN-induced kinase PINK1 and the phosphatase PGAM5 in mitochondria. Moreover, SLP2 inhibits the stress-activated peptidase OMA1, which can bind to SLP2 and cleaves PGAM5 in depolarized mitochondria. SLP2 restricts OMA1-mediated processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 allowing stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion under starvation conditions. Together, our results reveal an important role of SLP2 membrane scaffolds for the spatial organization of IM proteases regulating mitochondrial dynamics, quality control, and cell survival."

In this article, we describe the Korean Reference Genome Database (KRGDB) and its genome browser. The current version of our database contains both single nucleotide and short insertion/deletion variants. The DNA samples were obtained from four different origins and sequenced in different sequencing depths (10\u00d7 coverage of 63 individuals, 20\u00d7 coverage of 194 individuals, combined 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 coverage of 135 individuals, 30\u00d7 coverage of 230 individuals and 30\u00d7 coverage of 1100 individuals). The major features of the KRGDB are that it contains information on the Korean genomic variant frequency, frequency difference between the Korean and other populations and the variant functional annotation (such as regulatory elements in ENCODE regions and coding variant functions) of the variant sites. Additionally, we performed the genome-wide association study (GWAS) between Korean genome variant sites for the 30\u00d7230 individuals and three major common diseases (diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome). The association results are displayed on our browser.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks. We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer."

In phase 1b, MTD was 180\u202fmg (5/14 schedule) and not reached (2/7 schedule); RP2D was 300\u202fmg (2/7 schedule). In phases 1b and 2, ORR across dosing cohorts (210-330\u202fmg) for the 2/7 schedule was 58.7% overall and 46.4% for bortezomib-refractory patients (n\u202f=\u202f28).

Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of breast or ovarian cancer patients with breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutations. Here, we report the development of a small molecule targeting PARP1 based on the hydrophobic tagging (HyT) method. Targeted protein misfolding and consequent degradation are caused by HyT. Hydrophobic-tagged olaparib induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of PARP1 and shows enhanced antitumor effects compared to olaparib in TNBC cells. In addition, hydrophobic-tagged olaparib causes ER stress-related unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy, and apoptosis. These results point towards encouraging prospects for chemically modifying approved drugs that not only exhibit superior effects compared to those of the original drugs by triggering novel mechanisms but also provide great feasibility in the translational scenario."

In this study, In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MLN4924 on angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and four types of cancer cells. Our results showed that MLN4924 inhibits cell viability and induced apoptosis in HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. MLN4924 inhibits proliferation and interferes with the cell cycle checkpoint regulators, p21, p27, and phospho-histone H3. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment increased the level of UBC12 in HUVECs, indicating that neddylation pathway is involved in VEGF-activated angiogenesis. MLN4924 decreased VEGF-activated cell proliferation via neddylation inhibition. MLN4924 inhibited VEGF-activated cell migration, capillary tube formation and VEGF-mediated Erk1/2 activation in HUVECs. We also examined antitumor effect of MLN4924 using xenograft SCID mouse models of four different types of cancer cells. The in vivo results showed MLN4924 inhibited tumor growth in all four types of cancers with decreasing CD31 expression in xenograft tumor. In conclusion, MLN4924 inhibited viability, migration, and VEGF-promoted angiogenic activity in HUVECs; consistently, MLN4924 inhibited tumor growth in four types of cancers with suppression of angiogenesis. These findings provide evidence to develop therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment through anti-angiogenesis through neddylation inhibition."

We analysed 19,200 well-annotated protein-coding genes and determined that 4,951 protein-coding genes overlapped with their adjacent genes. Approximately a quarter of all human protein-coding genes were overlapping genes. We observed different clusters of overlapping protein-coding genes, ranging from two genes (paired overlapping genes) to 22 genes. We also divided the paired overlapping protein-coding gene groups into four subtypes. We found that the divergent overlapping gene subtype had a stronger expression association than did the subtypes of 5'-tandem overlapping and 3'-tandem overlapping genes. The majority of paired overlapping genes exhibited comparable coincidental tissue expression profiles; however, a few overlapping gene pairs displayed distinctive tissue expression association patterns. In summary, we have carefully examined the genomic features and distributions about human overlapping protein-coding genes and found coincidental expression in tissues for most overlapping protein-coding genes."

Overexpression of Pirh2 is frequently detected in many clinical tumor tissues including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism of Pirh2 activation in tumorigenesis still remains poorly understood. In this study, we find a Pirh2-binding protein, SCYL1 binding protein 1 (SCYL1BP1), that can promote the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Pirh2. SCYL1BP1 colocalized with Pirh2 in the cytoplasm and prevented its localization to the nucleus. Ectopic expression of SCYL1BP1 increased the expression of p53 and further inhibited the G(1)/S transition of HCC cell lines. Conversely, knock down of SCYL1BP1 restored the expression of Pirh2 and inhibited p53 at protein level. Functional assays found that reintroduction of SCYL1BP1 into HCC cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice, suggesting the strong tumor-suppressive function of SCYL1BP1 in HCC progression. Furthermore, SCYL1BP1 was found to be frequently downregulated in HCC clinical specimens compared to their paired non-tumor tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Taken together, our data suggested that the interaction of SCYL1BP1/Pirh2 could accelerate Pirh2 degradation through an ubiquitin-dependent pathway. SCYL1BP1 may function as an important tumor suppressor gene in HCC development."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of miR-34a-5p (miR34a) as a circulating biomarker to follow disease progression and measure the therapeutic response. Stable forced re-expression of miR34a in Ewing sarcoma (EWS) cells significantly limited tumor growth in mice. Absolute quantification of miR34a in the plasma of mice and 31 patients showed that high levels of this miRNA inversely correlated with tumor volume. In addition, miR34a expression was higher in the blood of localized EWS patients than in the blood of metastatic EWS patients. In 12 patients, we followed miR34a expression during preoperative chemotherapy. While there was no variation in the blood miR34a levels in metastatic patients at the time of diagnosis or after the last cycle of preoperative chemotherapy, there was an increase in the circulating miR34a levels in patients with localized tumors. The three patients with the highest fold-increase in the miR levels did not show evidence of metastasis. Although this analysis should be extended to a larger cohort of patients, these findings imply that detection of the miR34a levels in the blood of EWS patients may assist with the clinical management of EWS."

In the present study, we studied the expression of CD48 in a total of 74 primary MM samples derived from patients to evaluate SLAMF2 (CD48) as a candidate in mAb therapy for MM. Of 74 samples, 39 were subjected to SLAMF7 analysis. Most of the MM cells, defined as CD38 and CD138 double-positive cells, showed strong expression of CD48 or SLAMF7 independent of disease stage or treatment history. In these 39 samples, most MM cells showed expression of both SLAMF7 and CD48; however, several samples showed expression of either only CD48 or only SLAMF7, including seven cases that were only highly positive for SLAMF7, and five that were only highly positive for CD48. Our study demonstrates that the immune receptor CD48 is overexpressed on MM cells together with SLAMF7, and that CD48 may be considered as an alternative target for treatment of MM in cases showing weak expression of SLAMF7."

To address this question we compared the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 and OVA localized either in the cytosol or in mitochondria. We showed that tumors expressing mitochondrial-localized NY-ESO-1 and OVA proteins elicit significantly higher frequencies of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo. We also demonstrated that this stronger immune response is dependent on the mitochondrial location of the antigenic proteins, which contributes to their higher steady state amount, compared with cytosolic-localized proteins. Consistent with these findings, we showed that injection of mitochondria purified from B16 melanoma cells can protect mice from a challenge with B16 cells, but not with irrelevant tumors. Finally, we extended these findings to cancer patients by demonstrating the presence of T-cell responses specific for mutated mitochondrial-localized proteins. These findings highlight the utility of prioritizing epitopes derived from mitochondrial-localized mutated proteins as targets for cancer vaccination strategies."

Most individuals with ACH have the recurrent mutation (p.Gly380Arg) in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the receptor and individuals with HCH show the common mutation (p.Asn540Lys) in the tyrosine kinase 1 (TK1) region. Other rare mutations have been reported, however no additional hot-spot has been identified.

Clinical diagnosis of the patient is intertwined with \"mild ACH\" or \"severe HCH\". He did not demonstrate acanthosis nigricans (AN). This mutation has been reported in two different patients and it is located in the Ig-III domain of the FGFR3 region near other mutations associated with ACH. Among the two the 8-year old one also demonstrated AN without evindece of hyperinsulinem.

Chromatography-based methods, however, can enrich methylated peptides in a global manner. Here we present a chromatography-based approach for highly efficient enrichment of methylated peptides. Protocols for the of high pH SCXtip preparation and methyl-peptide purification are described in detail. Key points such as cell culture in hM-SILAC medium and protein digestion by multiple endopeptidases are also presented.

RT-PCR was used to determine miR-372-3p and FGF9 mRNA expression in tissues and cells. Western blot was used to determine FGF9 expression in tissues and NCI-H520 cell line. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to confirm that FGF9 can be directly targeted by miR-372-3p. MTT, colony formation assays were conducted to investigate the effects of ectopic miR-372-3p and FGF9 expression on NCI-H520 cell growth. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the influence of miR-372-3p and FGF9 expression on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Transwell assay was also conducted to see the effects of miR-372-3p and FGF9 expression on NCI-H520 cell invasiveness. MiR-372-3p was found significantly overexpressed in both LSCC tissues and cell lines, whereas FGF9 mRNA was found underexpressed in LSCC tissues. MiR-372-3p directly bound to wild-type FGF9 mRNA 3'UTR, therefore led to the reduction in FGF9 expression. The upregulation of FGF9 or the downregulation of miR-372-3p substantially retarded LSCC cell growth, mitosis, and invasion. MiR-372-3p enhanced LSCC cell proliferation and invasion through inhibiting FGF9."

Studies have been extensively done in yeast and human, in insect, beyond the flies, however, the information of these genes is limited. Here, we therefore identified and characterized 32 DDX genes from Locusta migratoria (L. migratoria), a crop pest. Overview of the gene structure and domain composition showed that the gene size varies significantly from one to fifteen exons, and the encoded proteins contain the conserved helicase core with various extensions at their amino and carboxyl termini. Phylogenetic trees informed that these locust DDX family members have orthologs in all insect species examined and can be classified into 30 subfamilies, all of them found counterparts in human, and most in yeast as well. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that these genes are expressed in all stages and tissues examined, overall with higher expression level at second and third-instar nymphs and in the reproductive organs. RNA interference (RNAi) analyses showed that seven genes cause lethal phenotype when silenced, of which five lead to defective midgut and gastric caecum, indicating that these genes are essential for the survival and maintenance of normal digestive organs of locust. These data provide a foundation for further functional analysis of these DDX genes in locust."

Two types of Pro22 mutations have been previously reported: Pro22Ser in CMT2E with giant axons, and Pro22Thr in CMT1F. In this study, we identified another Pro22 mutation, Pro22Arg, in a Korean CMT1 family. An investigation to identify the clinical and pathological characteristics of the Pro22Arg revealed that it is associated with demyelinating neuropathy features in CMT1F. Histopathological findings showed onion bulb formations but no giant axons. It appears that the Pro22 mutations may influence not only the Thr-Pro phosphorylation site by proline-directed protein kinases but also other structural alteration of the NEFL protein in a different way."

These modifications are dynamic, with cellular machinery identified to modulate and interpret the marks. Our focus is on bromodomains, which bind to acetylated lysine residues. Progress in the study of bromodomains, and the development of bromodomain ligands, has been rapid. These advances have been underpinned by many disciplines, but chemistry and chemical biology have undoubtedly played a significant role.

In the last two decades, a better understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology allowed the development of targeted therapies, including biologics and small molecules. As to biologics, different classes are now available including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors were the first biologics introduced for psoriasis treatment and include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab. The class of IL-17 inhibitors encompasses secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, bimekizumab, netakimab and M1095. The novel class of IL-23 inhibitors, including guselkumab, risankizumab and tildrakizumab, bind the p19 subunit of IL-23 in order to prevent the activation of IL-23 receptor. They differ from ustekinumab as the latter antibody inhibits the p40 subunit shared by both IL-23 and IL-12. The availability of biosimilars at much lower cost compared to originators is dramatically changing the access of patients to these treatments. In the coming years, studies will progress to identify subgroups of patients based on biomarkers for a more personalized treatment approach."

CS is due to loss-of-function mutations in SLC9A6, encoding NHE6, a sodium-hydrogen exchanger involved in the regulation of early endosomal pH. Here we review what is currently known about the neuropathogenesis of CS, based on insights from experimental models, which to date have focused on mechanisms that affect the CNS, specifically the brain. In addition, parental reports of sensory disturbances in their children with CS, including an apparent insensitivity to pain, led us to explore sensory function and related neuropathology in Slc9a6 KO mice. We present new data showing sensory deficits in Slc9a6 KO mice, which had reduced behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli (Hargreaves and Von Frey assays, respectively) compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system revealed intracellular accumulation of the glycosphingolipid GM2 ganglioside in KO but not WT mice. This cellular storage phenotype was most abundant in neurons of lamina I-II of the dorsal horn, a major relay site in the processing of painful stimuli. Spinal cords of KO mice also exhibited changes in astroglial and microglial populations throughout the gray matter suggestive of a neuroinflammatory process. Our findings establish the Slc9a6 KO mouse as a relevant tool for studying the sensory deficits in CS, and highlight selective vulnerabilities in relevant cell populations that may contribute to this phenotype. How NHE6 loss of function leads to such a multifaceted neurological syndrome is still undefined, and it is likely that NHE6 is involved with many cellular processes critical to normal nervous system development and function. In addition, the sensory issues exhibited by Slc9a6 KO mice, in combination with our neuropathological findings, are consistent with NHE6 loss of function impacting the entire nervous system. Sensory dysfunction in intellectually disabled individuals is challenging to assess and may impair patient safety and quality of life. Further mechanistic studies of the neurological impairments underlying CS and other genetic intellectual disability disorders must also take into account mechanisms affecting broader nervous system function in order to understand the full range of associated disabilities."

The incidence of EoE has increased substantially over the past two decades, coinciding with the so-called allergy epidemic. Current treatment options consist of dietary intervention, endoscopic dilatation, and pharmacotherapy. Given that EoE is a chronic progressive disease that is prone to relapse after cessation of therapy, these treatment options are suboptimal for long-term management. Persistent, uncontrolled esophageal inflammation is associated with esophageal remodeling and stricture formation, thus, the creation and/or discovery of alternative treatments is of paramount importance. The pathogenesis of EoE is currently under intense investigation, and recent insights concerning cellular and molecular etiology have led to the development of therapies that target specific pathophysiological pathways. This article provides an overview of established EoE pharmacotherapies, which include proton pump inhibitors and swallowed topical steroids. Additionally, anti-allergic targets, immunosuppressives, and monoclonal antibodies (such as mepolizumab, reslizumab, QAX576, RPC4046, dupilumab, omalizumab, and infliximab) that have been evaluated as treatments for EoE are summarized. Finally, several promising therapeutic agents (e.g., sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 antibodies, the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 signal blocker losartan, CC chemokine receptor type 3 antagonists, thymic stromal lymphopoietin antibodies, antibodies targeting the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, anti-interleukin-9 antibodies, and anti-interleukin-15 antibodies) that target specific molecules or cells implicated in the pathogenesis of EoE are proposed."

The main complication is infection, whose risk increases with the depth and duration of the neutropenia. Comprehensive etiological investigations are mandatory to determine the best treatment strategy. Constitutional neutropenia is rarely seen in everyday rheumatology practice. It predominantly affects patients of African descent and is usually moderate and well tolerated. Congenital neutropenia due to genetic abnormalities is severe and chiefly seen in the pediatric population. Most cases of neutropenia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are acquired. Medications are the most common causes, making detailed history-taking crucial. Many medications used to treat RA can induce neutropenia. Folic acid deficiency should be sought routinely in patients taking methotrexate. A less common cause of neutropenia is an RA-related autoimmune reaction. Splenomegaly suggests Felty's syndrome, which is accompanied with large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia in 40% of cases. The treatment depends on the depth of the neutropenia and findings from the etiological workup. A neutrophil count below 0.5g/L, a fever, and the presence of clinical signs indicate a life-threatening condition requiring emergent treatment. In other patients, the first step is immediate discontinuation of any possibly involved drugs, simultaneously with the etiological workup. "

Approximately 50-60 cases of SGS have been recorded in the literature worldwide since its discovery in 1982. This collagen disorder affects bone and vascular development throughout the body, resulting in craniosynostosis, scoliosis, chest deformities, and aortic root dilation. Patients may have problems in the central nervous system, including Chiari 1 malformation, hydrocephalus, and dilation of the lateral ventricles. Unfortunately, the symptoms of SGS closely parallel those of related collagenopathies involving mutations in the TGF-\u00df signaling pathway, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult without genetic testing, especially in cases with complex presentation. CASE REPORT In this report we present the unique and complex disease manifestations in a 9-year-old girl with SGS. The patient had severe cervical spinal instability that resolved after surgical occipital-C4 fusion with an autograft from the rib. Midface distraction surgery was used to treat the patient's craniosynostosis and related facial deformities. This surgery was complicated by loss of 750 mL of blood due to insufficient dura and prominent vasculature. CONCLUSIONS Connective tissue symptoms associated with SGS can involve dural and vascular problems, as seen in this case report. Thus, the risk of extreme blood loss should be anticipated any time midface distraction surgery is performed on an SGS patient. Continued research is needed to define how this case relates to the SGS patient population."

Although the function of KLK5 and KLK7 has been previously studied, the role of KLK14 in skin homeostasis and its contribution to Netherton syndrome pathogenesis remains unknown. We generated a transgenic murine model overexpressing human KLK14 (TghKLK14) in stratum granulosum. TghKLK14 mice revealed increased proteolytic activity in the granular layers and in hair follicles. Their hair did not grow and displayed major defects with hyperplastic hair follicles when hKLK14 was overexpressed. TghKLK14 mice displayed abnormal epidermal hyperproliferation and differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed cell separation in the hair cortex and increased thickness of Huxley's layer. Desmoglein (Dsg) 2 staining was increased, whereas Dsg3 and Dsg4 were markedly reduced. In\u00a0vitro studies showed that hKLK14 directly cleaves recombinant human DSG3 and recombinant human DSG4, suggesting that their degradation contributes to hair abnormalities. Their skin showed an inflammatory signature, with enhanced expression of IL-36 family members and their downstream targets involved in innate immunity. This in\u00a0vivo study identifies KLK14 as an important contributor to hair abnormalities and skin inflammation seen in Netherton syndrome."

LBs and Lewy neurites are insoluble aggregates composed mainly of phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein and can be widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The distribution of LBs may determine the LBD phenotype. Braak hypothesized that Lewy pathology progresses ascendingly from the peripheral nervous system to the olfactory bulbs and brainstem and then to other brain regions. Braak's PD staging suggests that LBD is a prion-like disease. Most typical PD cases fit with Braak's PD staging, but the scheme fails in some cases. Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and essential tremor are common misdiagnoses for pathologically confirmed LBD. LBD exhibits considerable heterogeneity in both clinical and pathological settings, which makes clinical diagnosis challenging."

Initially, we incubated rat liver type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase samples with 0.5 mM of the plasticizers, and the deiodinase activity was measured. Among them, only BPA was capable to inhibit both type 1 and type 2 deiodinases. Then, adult male Wistar rats were treated orally with bisphenol A (40\u2009mg/kg b.w.) for 15 days and hepatic type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activities and serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured. In vivo bisphenol A treatment significantly reduced hepatic type 1 deiodinase activity but did not affect brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activity. Serum T4 levels were higher in bisphenol A group, while T3 remained unchanged. T3/T4 ratio was decreased in rats treated with bisphenol A, reinforcing the idea that peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone was affected by bisphenol A exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that bisphenol A can affect the metabolism of thyroid hormone thus disrupting thyroid signaling."

Here, we identify the seven-transmembrane frizzled-7 (Fz7, also known as FZD7) as the receptor for Wnt7b-mediated dendrite growth and complexity. Importantly, Fz7 is developmentally regulated in the intact hippocampus, and is localised along neurites and at dendritic growth cones, suggesting a role in dendrite formation and maturation.

Lysosomes not only house proteolytic enzymes, but also traffic organelles, sense nutrients, and repair mitochondria. Mitophagy is initiated by damaged mitochondria, which is ultimately degraded by the ALP to compensate for ATP loss. While both systems are dynamic and respond to continuous cellular stressors, most studies are derived from animal models or cell based systems, which do not provide complete real time data about cellular processes involved in the progression of lysosomal storage diseases in patients. Gaucher and Fabry diseases are rare sphingolipid disorders due to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes; glucocerebrosidase and \u03b1-galactosidase A with resultant lysosomal dysfunction. Little is known about ALP pathology and mitochondrial function in patients with Gaucher and Fabry diseases, and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Studying blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients, we provide in vivo evidence, that regulation of ALP is defective. In PBMCs derived from Gaucher patients, we report a decreased number of autophagic vacuoles with increased cytoplasmic localization of LC3A/B, accompanied by lysosome accumulation. For both Gaucher and Fabry diseases, the level of the autophagy marker, Beclin1, was elevated and ubiquitin binding protein, SQSTM1/p62, was decreased. mTOR inhibition did not activate autophagy and led to ATP inhibition in PBMCs. Lysosomal abnormalities, independent of the type of the accumulated substrate suppress not only autophagy, but also mitochondrial function and mTOR signaling pathways. ERT partially restored ALP function, LC3-II accumulation and decreased LC3-I/LC3-II ratios. Levels of lysosomal (LAMP1), autophagy (LC3), and mitochondrial markers, (Tfam), normalized after ERT infusion. In conclusion, there is mTOR pathway dysfunction in sphingolipidoses, as observed in both PBMCs derived from patients with Gaucher and Fabry diseases, which leads to impaired autophagy and mitochondrial stress. ERT partially improves ALP function."

Here, we screened a small-molecule library to find drugs that promotes nuclear export of HDAC5. We found that dopamine receptor antagonists, domperidone and loxapine succinate, stimulate export of HDAC5, even in Pkd1-/-cells. Domperidone targets Drd3 receptor to modulate the phosphorylation of HDAC5. Domperidone treatment increases HDAC5 phosphorylation likely by reducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, thus shifting the equilibrium towards HDAC5-P and export from the nucleus. Treating Pkd1-/-mice with domperidone showed significantly reduced cystic growth and cell proliferation. Further, treated mice displayed a reduction in glomerular cyst and increased body weight and activity. These results suggest that HDAC5 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may be modulated to impede disease progression in ADPKD and uncovers an unexpected role for a class of dopamine receptors in renal epithelial morphogenesis."

Like viroids, HDV has a circular RNA genome which adopts a rod-like secondary structure, possesses ribozyme domains, replicates in the nucleus of infected cells by redirecting host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAP), and relies heavily on host proteins for its replication due to its small size and limited protein coding capacity. These similarities suggest an evolutionary relationship between HDV and viroids, and information on HDV could allow a better understanding of viroids and might globally help understanding the pathogenesis and molecular biology of these subviral RNAs.

Recent genome-wide loss-of-function screens, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR-Cas9 libraries, are an unprecedented resource to identify novel drug targets, reposition drugs and associate predictive biomarkers in the context of precision oncology. In this work, we have developed and validated a large-scale bioinformatics tool named DrugSniper, which exploits loss-of-function experiments to model the sensitivity of 6237 inhibitors and predict their corresponding biomarkers of sensitivity in 30 tumor types. Applying DrugSniper to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), we identified genes extensively explored in SCLC, such as Aurora kinases or epigenetic agents. Interestingly, the analysis suggested a remarkable vulnerability to polo-like kinase 1 ("

Areas Covered: We review the hypothesized therapeutic mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, including abrogation of B cell receptor signaling, blockade of microenvironmental pro-survival signals, and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. We examine toxicities of idelalisib, including bacterial infections (possibly secondary to drug-induced neutropenia), opportunistic infections (possibly attributable to on-target inhibition of T cell function), and organ toxicities such as transaminitis and enterocolitis (possibly autoimmune, secondary to on-target inhibition of p110\u03b4 in regulatory T cells). We evaluate PI3K inhibitors that have entered trials for the treatment of lymphoma, focusing on agents with selectivity for PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b4. Expert Opinion: PI3K inhibitors, particularly those that target p110\u03b4, have robust efficacy in the treatment of CLL and iNHL. However, idelalisib has infectious and autoimmune toxicities that limit its use. Outside of trials, idelalisib should be restricted to CLL patients with progression on ibrutinib or iNHL patients with progression on two prior therapies. Whether newer PI3K inhibitors will demonstrate differentiated toxicity profiles in comparable patient populations while retaining efficacy remains to be seen."

Anti-ubiquitin antibodies labelled pale bodies and Lewy bodies in typical PD and DLBD, and there was a strong positive correlation between numbers of ubiquitin-immunoreactive pale bodies and Lewy bodies. BF10, a monoclonal antibody against a phosphate-dependent epitope of neurofilament 155-kDa polypeptide subunit, immunolabelled 57% of Lewy bodies and 15% of pale bodies in typical PD. Some pale bodies and Lewy bodies were seen in the substantia nigra of 2 of 5 neurologically normal, aged controls, probably representing \"incidental PD\". We conclude that there is a close relationship between pale bodies and typical Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra in clinical varieties of PD, and that these inclusions share antigenic determinants. If pale bodies and Lewy bodies reflect separate aspects of the cellular pathology in PD, their formation probably occurs in parallel. Alternatively, these observations may suggest that pale bodies represent a stage in the formation of Lewy bodies."

However, the Dcp2 decapping enzyme is poorly active on its own and requires binding to stable or transient protein partners to sever the cap of target mRNAs. Here, we analyse the role of one of these partners, the yeast Pby1 factor, which is known to co-localize into P-bodies together with decapping factors. We report that Pby1 uses its C-terminal domain to directly bind to the decapping enzyme. We solved the structure of this Pby1 domain alone and bound to the Dcp1-Dcp2-Edc3 decapping complex. Structure-based mutant analyses reveal that Pby1 binding to the decapping enzyme is required for its recruitment into P-bodies. Moreover, Pby1 binding to the decapping enzyme stimulates growth in conditions in which decapping activation is compromised. Our results point towards a direct connection of Pby1 with decapping and P-body formation, both stemming from its interaction with the Dcp1-Dcp2 holoenzyme."

ICIs increased antitumor T cells' responses and showed a key role in reducing the acquired immune system tolerance which is overexpressed by cancer and tumor microenvironment. However, 50% of patients could not benefit from ICIs monotherapy. To overcome this, a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is frequently investigated as an approach to improve oncological outcomes. Despite promising results for the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, safety concerns slowed down the development of such strategies. Herein, we review data concerning the clinical activity and the adverse events of ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy, assessing ongoing clinical trials to identify clinical outlines that may support combination therapy as an effective treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy in several cancers."

A variant in the gene coding for the alpha 1C subunit of L-type voltage gated calcium channel (CACNA1C) has been shown to negatively affect several neurocognitive domains. We conducted a 4-week, open label, pilot study of isradipine, a calcium channel blocker, to determine its feasibility, safety, and efficacy in improving cognition in SZ patients. Ten adults with stable SZ were started on a flexible dose of isradipine 5\u00a0mg/day (up to 10\u00a0mg/day) for 4\u00a0weeks. Weekly in-person visits tracked side effects and symptoms while neurocognition and functional capacity were assessed at baseline and week 4. There were no serious adverse events reported. Newly emergent side effects were dizziness (1 new incidence at week 4); difficulty sleeping (2 new incidences at week 4); and decreased energy (3 new incidences at week 4). 1 patient discontinued medication and was withdrawn. Treatment did not exacerbate clinical symptoms. Although power is limited, results indicate no clear benefit on neurocognition but a positive effect (baseline mean\u00a0=\u00a06.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 to week 4 mean\u00a0=\u00a07.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1; t\u00a0=\u00a02.91, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) on functional capacity was noted. This open label, pilot study provides preliminary evidence that isradipine is a relatively safe medication when used adjunctively in SZ patients. This study suggests that isradipine offers no clear cognitive and only minimal functional benefit; however, additional studies may be warranted in symptomatic patients, or those with specific CACNA1C genotypes."

TTX-producing bacteria were found in the cultivable microflora of many TTX-bearing hosts, thereby providing strong support for the hypothesis that the toxin is of bacterial origin in these species. However, metagenomic studies of TTX-bearing animals addressing the whole microbial composition and estimating the contribution of TTX-producing bacteria to the overall toxicity of the host were not conducted. The present study is the first to characterize and compare the 16S rRNA gene data obtained from four TTX-bearing and four non-TTX-bearing species of marine ribbon worms. The statistical analysis showed that different nemertean species harbor distinct bacterial communities, while members of the same species mostly share more similar microbiomes. The bacterial species historically associated with TTX production were found in all studied samples but predominated in TTX-bearing nemertean species. This suggests that deeper knowledge of the microbiome of TTX-bearing animals is a key to understanding the origin of TTX in marine ecosystems."

These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology. "

We have attempted to establish the link between angiogenesis and cellular survival in the pathogenesis of ALS by compiling evidence described in various scientific reports. The phenotypes of human ALS have earlier been captured in the mutant SOD1 mice as well as by targeted deletion of the hypoxia response element (HRE) from the promoter of the mouse gene for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Indirect evidence shows that angiogenesis can help prevent oxidative stress, and hence, enhance cell survival. VEGF and angiogenin chiefly regulate the process of angiogenesis. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is usually found inside the nucleus, but in large number of cases of ALS, it accumulates in the cytoplasm (TDP-43 proteinopathy). Interestingly, TDP-43 proteinopathy is found to be aggravated in the presence of the OPTN mutation, which is the genetic factor that is responsible for such accumulation. Interaction of TDP-43 with progranulin can further affect the angiogenesis in ALS patients by regulating activity of VEGF receptors, but conclusive evidence is needed to establish its role in pathogenesis of ALS. Certain mutations in UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 indicate that ubiquitination has a role in ALS pathobiology, but its link to angiogenesis has not been adequately studied. Recent studies have shown that several mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can also cause ALS. Conclusively, in this review, we have attempted to argue the role of angiogenesis in enhanced ALS survival rate is probably regulated with the activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2. Additionally, interaction between OPTN and TDP-43 can also impact the transcription of various angiogenic molecules. Whether targeting angiogenic substances or TDP-43 can provide clues about extending ALS survival rate, in combination with current treatments, can only be evaluated after additional studies."

Nuclear sirtuin 1 and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase metabolically drive this dynamic and are druggable targets that promote immunometabolic resolution in septic mice and increase survival. We used unbiased metabolomics and a validated monocyte culture model of activation, deactivation, and partial resolution of acute inflammation to sequentially track metabolic rewiring. Increases in glycogenolysis, hexosamine, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathways were aligned with anabolic activation. Activation transitioned to combined lipid, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide catabolism during deactivation, and partially subsided during early resolution. Lipid metabolic rewiring signatures aligned with deactivation included elevated n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased levels of fatty acid acylcarnitines. Increased methionine to homocysteine cycling increased levels of s-adenosylmethionine rate-limiting transmethylation mediator, and homocysteine and cysteine transsulfuration preceded increases in glutathione. Increased tryptophan catabolism led to elevated kynurenine and de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide from quinolinic acid. Increased branched-chain amino acid catabolism paralleled increases in succinyl-CoA. A rise in the Krebs cycle cis-aconitate-derived itaconate and succinate with decreased fumarate and acetyl-CoA levels occurred concomitant with deactivation and subsided during early resolution. The data suggest that rewiring of metabolic and mitochondrial bioenergetics by monocytes sequentially activates, deactivates, and resolves acute inflammation."

To investigate this massive macromolecular organelle, we generated a 'domain-level' centrosome interactome using direct protein-protein interaction data from a focused yeast two-hybrid screen. We then used biochemistry, cell biology and the model organism Drosophila to provide insight into the protein organization and kinase regulatory machinery required for centrosome assembly.

Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of heart failure. EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial has reported that empagliflozin, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, exerts cardiovascular benefits on diabetic population. However, the mechanism by which empagliflozin alleviates DCM still remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac protective effects of empagliflozin on spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mice and its potential mechanism. Eight weeks of empagliflozin treatment (10 mg/kg/day) decreased body weight and blood glucose level, and increased urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in diabetic mice. Echocardiography revealed that both systolic and diastolic functions of db/db mice were also obviously improved by empagliflozin. Furthermore, empagliflozin-treated diabetic mice presented with amelioration of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In addition, diabetic hearts exhibited the deterioration of oxidative stress, apoptosis and pyroptosis, while these effects were significantly counteracted after empagliflozin treatment. Moreover, empagliflozin rescued diabetes-induced suppression of sGC (soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme)-cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase) pathway. However, when sGC-\u03b2 expression of hearts was inhibited by transvascular delivery of small interfering RNA, cardiac dysfunction was aggravated and the advantages of empagliflozin were reversed through inhibiting sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway. Collectively, these findings indicate that empagliflozin improves cardiac function involving the inhibition of oxidative stress-induced injury via sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway and may be a promising therapeutic option for DCM."

Even though echocardiography is the cornerstone to demonstrate structural and/or functional alterations of the heart as the underlying cause for the clinical presentation, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) represents the noninvasive gold standard to assess cardiac morphology, function, and tissue changes. Indeed, CMR allows quantification of biventricular volumes, mass, wall thickness, systolic function, and intra- and extracardiac flows; diastolic functional indices include transmitral and pulmonary venous velocities, left ventricular and left atrial filling velocities from volumetric changes, strain analysis from myocardial tagging, tissue phase contrast, and feature tracking. Moreover, CMR allows superior tissue characterization of the myocardium and the pericardium, which are crucial for a noninvasive etiological and histopathological assessment of HFpEF: conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast sequences are now complemented by quantitative mapping sequences, including T1 and T2 mapping as well as extracellular volume quantification. Further experimental sequences comprise diffusion tensor analysis, blood oxygenation-dependent sequences, hyperpolarized contrast agents, spectroscopy, and elastography. Finally, artificial intelligence is beginning to help clinicians deal with an increasing amount of information from CMR exams."

Various types of DNA repair counteract highly toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to maintain genome stability. Recent findings suggest that the human DNA damage response (DDR) utilizes small RNA species, which are produced as long non-coding (nc)RNA precursors and promote recognition of DSBs. However, regulatory principles that control production of such transcripts remain largely elusive. Here we show that the Abelson tyrosine kinase c-Abl/ABL1 causes formation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) foci, predominantly phosphorylated at carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) residue Tyr1, at DSBs. CTD Tyr1-phosphorylated RNAPII (CTD Y1P) synthetizes strand-specific, damage-responsive transcripts (DARTs), which trigger formation of double-stranded (ds)RNA intermediates via DNA-RNA hybrid intermediates to promote recruitment of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) to endogenous DSBs. Interference with transcription, c-Abl activity, DNA-RNA hybrid formation or dsRNA processing impairs CTD Y1P foci formation, attenuates DART synthesis and delays recruitment of DDR factors and DSB signalling. Collectively, our data provide novel insight in RNA-dependent DDR by coupling DSB-induced c-Abl activity on RNAPII to generate DARTs for consequent DSB recognition."

The US FDA has approved 48 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of netarsudil (which is given as an eye drop) and temsirolimus (which is given intravenously). Of the 48 approved drugs, the majority (25) target receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, ten target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 13 target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases. The data indicate that 43 of these drugs are used in the treatment of malignancies (36 against solid tumors including lymphomas and seven against non-solid tumors, e.g., leukemias). Seven drugs are used in the treatment of non-malignancies: baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; netarsudil, glaucoma; tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, ibrutinib and sirolimus are used for the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The most common drug targets include ALK, B-Raf, BCR-Abl, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Most of the small molecule inhibitors (45) interact directly with the protein kinase domain. In contrast, sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are larger molecules (MW\u202f\u2248\u202f1000) that bind to FKBP-12 to generate a complex that inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This review presents the available drug-enzyme X-ray crystal structures for 27 of the approved drugs as well as the chemical structures and physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists. Six of the drugs bind covalently and irreversibly to their target. Twenty of the 48 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). Nearly half of the antagonists (23) have a lipophilic efficiency with values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5-10. One of the vexing problems is the near universal development of resistance that is associated with the use of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer."

After positive results with phase 1 treatment with AAV9-SMN, the first gene therapy for SMA, a phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing. Ataluren is the first approved drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with premature stop codon mutations and its indication has been recently extended since the age of 2\u00a0years. Exon skipping technology was and is currently tested in many phase 3 trials, and eteplirsen received a conditional approval by FDA for patients amenable to exon 51 skipping, but not by EMA. Many other compounds with different mechanisms of action are now tested in DMD by phase 2 and 3 trials, including phase 1 gene therapy. Other innovative approaches are under investigation, i.e., gene therapy in X-linked myotubular myopathy and Pompe disease, and antisense oligonucleotides in myotonic dystrophy type 1.

Ninety three proteins were observed at elevated level (\u22651.5 fold), and 30 were prioritized based on a scoring system comprising of confidence of identification, presence in the various specimen groups, functional relevance, and their secretory potential. Verification was carried out in independent patient cohorts for 8 selected, representative, upregulated proteins using ELISA.

Other members may also be investigated in a targeted manner to expand the portfolio of biomarkers for early detection. The mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015722.

We isolated three strains of the causative rickettsiae, designated Katayama, Misaka, and Abe, from patients with the disease and studied the characteristics of the isolates. Nude mice and cyclophosphamide-treated mice died after infection with the isolates. However, infected normal mice recovered and acquired immunity. Infected adult male guinea pigs had fever, a scrotal reaction, and seroconversion. The isolates propagated well in tissue-cultured Vero cells. Analysis by the cross-immunofluorescence antibody method showed that these isolates were closely related serologically. To reveal their immunological properties in detail, we produced 21 anti-Katayama monoclonal antibodies. Seven of these antibodies reacted with all representative strains of spotted fever group rickettsiae used in this study, and five others reacted only with the homologous strain, revealing that the Katayama strain has a strain-specific antigen(s) different from those of other spotted fever group rickettsiae. Moreover, these strain-specific antibodies also reacted with the Misaka and Abe strains. These results demonstrate that the causative agent of spotted fever group rickettsiosis in Japan is a new serotype of spotted fever group rickettsiae."

To identify which proteins are involved in the restoration of this sensitivity and to provide new therapeutic targets for mutant-KRAS lung adenocarcinoma, we performed an iTRAQ quantitative proteomic analysis after subcellular fractionation of H358-NSCLC treated with gefitinib and KDACi (TSA/NAM) versus gefitinib alone. The 86 proteins found to have been significantly dysregulated between the two conditions, were mainly involved in cellular metabolism and cell transcription processes. As expected, the pathway related to histone modifications was affected by the KDACi. Pathways known for controlling tumor development and (chemo)-resistance (miRNA biogenesis/glutathione metabolism) were affected by the KDACi/gefitinib treatment. Moreover, 57 dysregulated proteins were upstream of apoptosis (such as eEF1A2 and STAT1) and hence provide potential therapeutic targets. The inhibition by siRNA of eEF1A2 expression resulted in a slight decrease in H358-NSCLC viability. In addition, eEF1A2 and STAT1 siRNA transfections suggested that both STAT1 and eEF1A2 prevent AKT phosphorylation known for enhancing gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. Therefore, altogether our data provide new insights into proteome regulations in the context of overcoming the NSCLC resistance to gefitinib through KDACi in H358 KRAS mutated and amphiregulin-overexpressing NSCLC cells."

An increasing number of individuals with this mutation are reported to not have craniosynostosis. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of the high phenotypic variability seen in Muenke syndrome. DNA testing for the p.Pro250Arg mutation is routinely performed in Denmark, in children presenting with isolated coronal synostosis. Verified diagnosis entails detailed family history, drawing of family pedigree, DNA testing of the parents, genetic counseling, skull radiographs, clinical photographs, and follow-up. Sixteen individuals from 5 Danish families with Muenke syndrome are presented. Large phenotypic variation was seen both within and across families. The most striking observations were that 6/16 (38%) cases did not have craniosynostosis and one individual presented with a normal phenotype. In addition, 3 unrelated cases had incomplete cleft palate, submucous cleft palate, and bifid uvula, respectively. There is strong evidence for reduced penetrance of the craniosynostosis trait in Muenke syndrome. We argue that many studies on Muenke syndrome have been influenced by ascertainment bias in regard to craniosynostosis. In addition, it is suggested that oral clefting might be part of the clinical spectrum seen in Muenke syndrome."

However, the fundamental mechanisms underpinning cilia biogenesis and functions remain only partly understood. Here, we show that depleting LUZP1 or its interacting protein, EPLIN, increases the levels of MyosinVa at the centrosome and primary cilia formation. We further show that LUZP1 localizes to both actin filaments and the centrosome/basal body. Like EPLIN, LUZP1 is an actin-stabilizing protein that regulates actin dynamics, at least in part, by mobilizing ARP2 to the centrosomes. Both LUZP1 and EPLIN interact with known ciliogenesis and cilia-length regulators and as such represent novel players in actin-dependent centrosome to basal body conversion. Ciliogenesis deregulation caused by LUZP1 or EPLIN loss may thus contribute to the pathology of their associated disease states."

We present evidence that UHRF1 interacts with HSP90 chaperone complex and is a novel HSP90 client protein. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 with 17-AAG or 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin results in UHRF1 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Interestingly, this HSP90 inhibitor-induced UHRF1 degradation is independent of CHIP and CUL5, two previously identified ubiquitin E3 ligases for HSP90 client proteins. In addition, this degradation is dependent neither on the intrinsic E3 ligase of UHRF1 nor on the E3 ligase SCF(\u03b2-TRCP) that has been implicated in regulation of UHRF1 stability. We also provide evidence that HSP90 inhibitors may suppress cancer cell proliferation in part through its induced UHRF1 degradation. Taken together, our results identify UHRF1 as a novel HSP90 client protein and shed light on the regulation of UHRF1 stability and function."

We report a 40-year-old man who was referred for severe gait difficulty. At age 6 years the patient presented with a waddling gate, lumbar lordosis and heel contractures. Both electrophysiology and muscle biopsy were consistent with a neurogenic disorder and he received a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy type 3.

In mice treated with 3-NP, a complex II inhibitor, infusion of D\u03b2HB attenuates motor deficits, striatal lesions, and microgliosis in this model of toxin induced-striatal neurodegeneration. In transgenic R6/2 mice, infusion of D\u03b2HB extends life span, attenuates motor deficits, and prevents striatal histone deacetylation. In PC12 cells with inducible expression of mutant huntingtin protein, we further demonstrate that D\u03b2HB prevents histone deacetylation via a mechanism independent of its mitochondrial effects and independent of histone deacetylase inhibition. These pre-clinical findings suggest that by simultaneously targeting the mitochondrial and the epigenetic abnormalities associated with mutant huntingtin, D\u03b2HB may be a valuable therapeutic agent for HD."

Lactotroph adenomas occur in the general population at a prevalence of 45/100,000, are more common in women, but also involve men and children of both sexes. Most lactotroph adenomas are microadenomas occurring in reproductive-age women who present with oligo/amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility. In men and elderly women, lactotroph adenomas are usually macroadenomas and are most commonly associated with symptoms of a tumoral mass, including headaches, neurologic defects, and visual loss. Although clinical and laboratory features may differ depending on patient's gender and age, the histopathology of the tumors is similar. Lactotroph adenomas are histologically classified into three subtypes: the common sparsely granulated lactotroph adenoma, and the rare densely granulated lactotroph adenoma and acidophilic stem cell adenoma. We will review the main pathological features of the lactotroph adenomas and some of their characteristics that may predict biological behavior and responsiveness to treatment."

Several FA genes, including FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCM, and FANCU/XRCC2, have been identified as causative genes for premature ovary insufficiency (POI). Fanconi anemia group L protein (FANCL) cooperates with FANCT/UBE2T to ubiquitinate the FANCI-D2 dimer, which is a crucial event in the process of ICLs repair. Fancl-knockout mice phenocopy human POI, but the role of FANCL mutations in POI pathogenesis has not been confirmed. In the present work, potentially pathogenic mutations in the FANCL gene were screened in 200 Chinese patients with idiopathic POI and in 200 matched controls. Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations, c.1048_1051delGTCT (p.Gln350Valfs*18) and c.739dupA (p.Met247Asnfs*4), were identified in the FANCL gene in POI patients but not in controls. Wild-type FANCL protein was predominantly localized in the nuclei, while both mutant FANCL proteins were retained in the cytoplasm. In addition, the FANCL variants exhibited impaired ubiquitin-ligase activity and compromised DNA repair ability after mitomycin C treatment. Furthermore, the FANCL variants were deleterious and might be associated with haploinsufficiency. Our results show that FANCL mutations are potentially causative for POI by disrupting DNA damage repair processes."

Their contour length in 0.02 M salt is 2.7 times shorter than that of viral DNA form I obtained after dissociation of the proteins in 1 M NaCl. The nucleosomes have an average diameter of 12.5 nm. Each nucleosome contains 175 to 205 DNA base pairs condensed fivefold in length. The nucleosomes are regularly spaced on the circular molecule. The internucleosomal filaments are made of naked DNA, and each filament contains about 55 base pairs. The partial sensitivity of the nucleoprotein complex to cleavage by EcoR1 endonuclease suggests that the nucleosomes are not formed at specific sites on the viral genome. Faster sedimenting nucleoprotein complexes containing replicative intermediates were studied.

Once introduced, 5meC can be maintained through DNA replication by the activity of 'maintenance' DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Despite their ancient origin, DNA methylation pathways differ widely across animals, such that 5meC is either confined to transcribed genes or lost altogether in several lineages. We used comparative epigenomics to investigate the evolution of DNA methylation. Although the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lacks DNA methylation, more basal nematodes retain cytosine DNA methylation, which is targeted to repeat loci. We found that DNA methylation coevolved with the DNA alkylation repair enzyme ALKB2 across eukaryotes. In addition, we found that DNMTs introduced the toxic lesion 3-methylcytosine into DNA both in vitro and in vivo. Alkylation damage is therefore intrinsically associated with DNMT activity, and this may promote the loss of DNA methylation in many species."

To test this hypothesis, parotid secretory protein (PSP), which is stored efficiently in parotid acinar cells, was expressed in the endocrine cell lines GH4C1 and PC12. PSP undergoes stimulated secretion in both cell types. Secretion is similar to that of the endocrine regulated secretory protein chromogranin A but distinct from secreted alkaline phosphatase, a marker for the constitutive secretory pathway in endocrine cells.

DNA extracted from pre-treatment NSCLC tumor tissue with known activating EGFR mutations, diagnosed between October 2010 and May 2017 at PathWest laboratory, was used to perform targeted dPCR for quantitative detection of T790M mutations.

Overall response rate to first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) was 67% regardless of T790M status. The median progression free survival was 10.7 (IQR 5.6-19.9) versus 6.7 (IQR 3.5-20.8) months in T790M negative and positive patients respectively.

The increased prevalence of NTM infection can be explained by an ageing population with rising comorbidities, HIV infection, the common use of immunosuppressive drugs, and improved diagnostic methods. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the clinical relevance of NTMs in children, describing their features and manifestations, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic approaches. We collected data from the literature about NTM infections in young patients over the past five years (2014-2019) using the keywords \"non-tuberculous\", \"mycobacteria\", \"paediatric\", \"NTM\", \"cystic fibrosis\", and \"children\". Recent literature points out that NTMs are ubiquitous, with several species including both those that are pathogens for humans and those that are not. This means that, if a mycobacterium is isolated from a patient's specimen, we have to distinguish between a simple colonization and an NTM-related disease. The start of treatment depends on many factors that are necessary to consider, such as clinical and imaging features, patient comorbidity and immunocompetence, drug adverse effects, and compliance with a very long therapy that can last many months. Due to the increasing prevalence and clinical relevance of NTMs, guidelines for their optimal management, especially in the presence of chronic underlying disease, are urgently needed."

In this perspective, it was decided to perform a preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of ethosuximide, a T-type channel blocker used clinically as an antiepileptic, as a novel pharmacological treatment for chronic pain. Assessment of the effect of ethosuximide was thus made in both nociception and pain-related comorbidities as anxiety and depression are frequently encountered in chronic pain patients. Our results show that such symptoms occurred in three animal models of chronic pain designed to reflect traumatic neuropathic, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions. Administration of ethosuximide reduced both chronic pain and comorbidities with a marked intensity ranging from partial reduction to a complete suppression of symptoms. These results make ethosuximide, and more broadly the inhibition of T-type calcium channels, a new strategy for the management of uncontrolled chronic pain, likely to improve not only pain but also the accompanying anxiety and depression."

However, previously investigated CGRP receptor antagonists, telcagepant and MK-3207, were discontinued during clinical development because of concerns about drug-induced liver injury. A subsequent effort to identify novel CGRP receptor antagonists less likely to cause hepatotoxicity led to the development of ubrogepant. The selection of ubrogepant, following a series of mechanistic studies conducted with MK-3207 and telcagepant, was focused on key structural modifications suggesting that ubrogepant was less prone to forming reactive metabolites than previous compounds. The potential for each drug to cause liver toxicity was subsequently assessed using a quantitative systems toxicology approach (DILIsym\u00ae) that incorporates quantitative assessments of mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of bile acid homeostasis, and oxidative stress, along with estimates of dose-dependent drug exposure to and within liver cells. DILIsym successfully modeled liver toxicity for telcagepant and MK-3207 at the dosing regimens used in clinical trials. In contrast, DILIsym predicted no hepatotoxicity during treatment with ubrogepant, even at daily doses up to 1000\u2009mg (10-fold higher than the proposed clinical dose of 100\u2009mg). These predictions are consistent with clinical trial experience showing that ubrogepant has lower potential to cause hepatotoxicity than has been observed with telcagepant and MK-3207."

If not restored by molecular chaperones, abnormal proteins are typically degraded by proteasomes or eliminated by selective autophagy. The discovery that both pathways are initiated by substrate ubiquitylation but utilize different ubiquitin receptors incited a debate over how pathway choice is achieved. Here, we demonstrate in yeast that pathway choice is made after substrate ubiquitylation by competing ubiquitin receptors harbouring either proteasome- or autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8/LC3)-binding modules. Proteasome pathway receptors bind ubiquitin moieties more efficiently, but autophagy receptors gain the upper hand following substrate aggregation and receptor bundling. Indeed, by using sets of modular artificial receptors harbouring identical ubiquitin-binding modules we found that proteasome/autophagy pathway choice is independent of the ubiquitin-binding properties of the receptors but largely determined by their oligomerization potentials. Our work thus suggests that proteasomal degradation and selective autophagy are two branches of an adaptive protein quality control pathway, which uses substrate ubiquitylation as a shared degradation signal."

As a core protein of IFT complex A, IFT140 has been shown to have a relationship with serious skeletal ciliopathies caused in humans. However, the effects and mechanisms of IFT140 in bone formation have not been systematically disclosed. To further investigate the potential role of IFT140 in osteogenesis, we established a mouse model by conditional deletion of IFT140 in pre-osteoblasts. The adult knock-out mice exhibited dwarf phenotypes, such as short bone length, less bone mass, and decreased bone mineral apposition rate. In addition, by IFT140 deletion, the expressions of several osteoblastic markers were decreased and loss of bone became severe with aging. These results suggest that cilia gene Ift140 is essential in bone development."

Self-associating Prion-like domains in each protein form multivalent interactions and labile cross-\u03b2 structures.

Herein, we show that Hic-5 is tyrosine-phosphorylated on residues 38 and 60 following epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of COS-7 cells, coincident with an increase in peripheral actin reorganization. To explore the role of Hic-5 phosphorylation in this process, we introduced wild-type (WT) and mutant Hic-5 constructs into COS-7 cells and determined that EGF-induced lamellipodia formation was suppressed by WT Hic-5. This effect required localization to focal adhesions as well as phosphorylation of Hic-5 as overexpression of both a non-targeting and a non-phosphorylatable Hic-5 failed to inhibit peripheral actin reorganization. Interestingly, overexpression of non-phosphorylatable Y31/118F or WT paxillin did not affect lamellipodia formation, indicating that this effect is specific to Hic-5. The EGF-induced lamellipodia were Rac-dependent and overexpressed WT Hic-5, but not non-phosphorylatable Hic-5 inhibited Rac activation. Our data suggest that Hic-5 tyrosine phosphorylation functions to regulate signaling associated with lamellipodia formation, a process fundamental to cell motility."

Accumulating evidences document that they undergo age-related modifications, with consequences on metabolism, sleep/wake disorders and progression of neurodegenerations. The present study addressed the age related changes in expression and distribution of orexin A (its precursor is also known as hypocretin-HCRT) and NPY, and their regulation by food intake in the short-lived vertebrate model Nothobranchius furzeri. Our experiments, conducted on male specimens, show that: (a) HCRT and OXA and NPY mRNA and protein are localized in neurons of diencephalon and optic tectum, as well as in numerous fibers projecting through the entire neuroaxis, and are colocalized in specific nuclei; (b) in course of aging, HCRT and NPY expressing neurons are localized also in telencephalon and rhombencephalon; (c) HCRT expressing neurons increased slightly in the diencephalic area of old animals and in fasted animals, whereas NPY increased sharply; (d) central HCRT levels are not regulated neither in course of aging nor by food intake; and (e) central NPY levels are augmented in course of aging, and regulated by food intake only in young. These findings represent a great novelty in the study of central orexinergic and NPY-ergic systems in vertebrates', demonstrating an uncommon and unprecedented described regulation of these two orexigenic neuropeptides."

Characteristic mass shifts and fragment ions indicating ubiquitinated lysine residues in tryptic and gluC digests are discussed. When a ubiquitinated protein is enzymatically digested, a portion of the ubiquitin side chain remains attached to the modified lysine. This \"tag\" can be used to distinguish a ubiquitinated peptide from the unmodified version, and can be incorporated into automated database searching. Several tags are discussed, the GGK and LRGGK tags, resulting from complete and incomplete tryptic digestion of the protein, and the STLHLVLRLRGG tag from a gluC-digested protein.A ubiquitinated peptide has two N-termini-one from the original peptide and the other from the ubiquitin side chain. Thus, it is possible to have two series of b ions and y ions, the additional series is the one that includes fragments containing portions of the ubiquitin side chain, and any diagnostic ions for the modification must include portions of this side chain. Fragment ions involving any part of the \"normal\" peptide will vary in mass according to the peptide being modified and will therefore not be of general diagnostic use. These diagnostic ions, found through examination of the MS/MS spectra of model ubiquitinated tryptic and gluC peptides, have not previously been reported. These ions can be used to trigger precursor ion scanning in automated MS/MS data acquisition scanning modes."

An effective vaccine, particularly one with a marked effect on disease transmission, would undoubtedly be an invaluable tool for efforts to control and eliminate malaria. RTS,S/AS01, the most advanced malaria vaccine to date, targets the parasite before it invades the liver and has the potential to prevent malaria disease as well as transmission by preventing blood stage infection and therefore gametocytogenesis. Unfortunately efficacy in a phase III clinical trial was limited and it is widely believed that a malaria vaccine needed to contain multiple antigens from different life-cycle stages to have a realistic chance of success. A recent study in mice has shown that partially efficacious interventions targeting the pre-erythrocytic and the sexual lifecycle stage synergise in eliminating malaria from a population over multiple generations. Hence, the combination of RTS,S/AS01 with a transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) is highly appealing as a pragmatic and powerful way to increase vaccine efficacy. Here we demonstrate that combining Pfs25-IMX313, one of the TBV candidates currently in clinical development, with RTS,S/AS01 readily induces a functional immune response against both antigens in outbred CD1 mice. Formulation of Pfs25-IMX313 in AS01 significantly increased antibody titres when compared to formulation in Alhydrogel, resulting in improved transmission reducing activity in standard membrane feeding assays (SMFA). Upon co-formulation of Pfs25-IMX313 with RTS,S/AS01, the immunogenicity of both vaccines was maintained, and functional assessment of the induced antibody response by SMFA and inhibition of sporozoite invasion assay (ISI) showed no reduction in biological activity against parasites of both lifecycle stages. Should this findings be translatable to human vaccination this could greatly aid efforts to eliminate and eventually eradicate malaria."

The ZEB2 protein is a complex transcription factor that encompasses multiple functional domains that interact with the regulatory regions of target genes including those involved in brain development. Recently, it has been documented that ZEB2 regulates the differentiation of interneuron progenitors migrating from the medial ganglionic eminence to cortical layers by repression of the Nkx2-1 homeobox transcription factor. It has therefore been suggested that the deficit in ZEB2 may induce an imbalance of neuronal inhibition/excitation leading to epileptic seizures. Given the phenotypic variability of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, to date, a distinctive genotype-phenotype correlation has not been delineated. Here, we report a patient with a severe phenotype of Mowat-Wilson syndrome, associated with a novel heterozygous de novo frame-shift variant in the ZEB2 gene, as well as an additional novel heterozygous missense variant in the SCN1A gene, the mutation of which is known to affect NaV1.1-mediated sodium current in GABAergic interneurons. We hypothesize that the severe neurological phenotype of our patient may be influenced by the coexistence of both genetic mutations. [Published with video sequence]."

The Ragulator complex functions as a lysosomal membrane scaffold for Rag GTPases to recruit and activate mTORC1. However, the roles of Ragulator structure in the regulation of mTORC1 function remain elusive. In this study, we disrupted Ragulator structure by directly anchoring RagC to lysosomes and monitored the effect on amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation. Expression of lysosome-anchored RagC in p18-deficient cells resulted in constitutive lysosomal localization and amino acid-independent activation of mTORC1. Co-expression of Ragulator in this system restored the amino acid dependency of mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, ablation of Gator1, a suppressor of Rag GTPases, induced amino acid-independent activation of mTORC1 even in the presence of Ragulator. These results demonstrate that Ragulator structure is essential for amino acid-dependent regulation of Rag GTPases via Gator1. In addition, our genetic analyses revealed new roles of amino acids in the regulation of mTORC1 as follows: amino acids could activate a fraction of mTORC1 in a Rheb-independent manner, and could also drive negative-feedback regulation of mTORC1 signaling via protein phosphatases. These intriguing findings contribute to our overall understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of mTORC1 signaling."

Our results were consistent with Pleistocene divergence followed by gene flow, mainly between the latter two clusters. There were no genetic signatures of rapid population expansions or bottlenecks. The population from the northern Atlantic Forest was the most genetically divergent group within the species. The demographic history of T. caerulescens was probably affected by series of humid and dry periods throughout the Quaternary that generated subtle population expansions and contractions allowing the intermittent connection of habitats along the circum-Amazonian belt. Recognizing the dynamic history of climate-mediated forest expansions, contractions, and connections during the South American Pleistocene is central toward a mechanistic understanding of circum-Amazonian distributions."

Removal of CenH3 from centromeres is a general property of terminally differentiated cells, and the persistence of CenH3 increases the risk of diseases such as cancer. However, active mechanisms of centromere disassembly are unknown. Nondividing Arabidopsis pollen vegetative cells, which transport engulfed sperm by extended tip growth, undergo loss of CenH3; centromeric heterochromatin decondensation; and bulk activation of silent rRNA genes, accompanied by their translocation into the nucleolus. Here, we show that these processes are blocked by mutations in the evolutionarily conserved AAA-ATPase molecular chaperone, CDC48A, homologous to yeast Cdc48 and human p97 proteins, both of which are implicated in ubiquitin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted protein degradation. We demonstrate that CDC48A physically associates with its heterodimeric cofactor UFD1-NPL4, known to bind ubiquitin and SUMO, as well as with SUMO1-modified CenH3 and mutations in NPL4 phenocopy cdc48a mutations. In WT vegetative cell nuclei, genetically unlinked ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci are uniquely clustered together within the nucleolus and all major rRNA gene variants, including those rDNA variants silenced in leaves, are transcribed. In cdc48a mutant vegetative cell nuclei, however, these rDNA loci frequently colocalized with condensed centromeric heterochromatin at the external periphery of the nucleolus. Our results indicate that the CDC48A(NPL4) complex actively removes sumoylated CenH3 from centromeres and disrupts centromeric heterochromatin to release bulk rRNA genes into the nucleolus for ribosome production, which fuels single nucleus-driven pollen tube growth and is essential for plant reproduction.

To enhance understanding of the phenotypic spectrum present in these individuals, we identified 30 males with MECP2 mutations in the RTT Natural History Study databases. A wide phenotypic spectrum was observed, ranging from severe neonatal encephalopathy to cognitive impairment. Two males with a somatic mutation in MECP2 had classic RTT. Of the remaining 28 subjects, 16 had RTT-causing MECP2 mutations, 9 with mutations that are not seen in females with RTT but are likely pathogenic, and 3 with uncertain variants. Two subjects with RTT-causing mutations were previously diagnosed as having atypical RTT; however, careful review of the clinical history determined that an additional 12/28 subjects met criteria for atypical RTT, but with more severe clinical presentation and course, and less distinctive RTT features, than females with RTT, leading to the designation of a new diagnostic entity, male RTT encephalopathy. Increased awareness of the clinical spectrum and widespread comprehensive genomic testing in boys with neurodevelopmental problems will lead to improved identification."

However, since the existing pan-Hsp90 inhibitor does not accumulate in mitochondria, the potential anticancer activity of pan-Hsp90 inhibition has not yet been fully examined in vivo. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that all Hsp90 paralogs were upregulated in prostate cancer. Inactivation of all Hsp90 paralogs induced mitochondrial dysfunction, increased cytosolic calcium, and activated calcineurin. Active calcineurin blocked prosurvival heat shock responses upon Hsp90 inhibition by preventing nuclear translocation of HSF1. The purine scaffold derivative DN401 inhibited all Hsp90 paralogs simultaneously and showed stronger anticancer activity than other Hsp90 inhibitors. Pan-Hsp90 inhibition increased cytotoxicity and suppressed mechanisms that protect cancer cells, suggesting that it is a feasible strategy for the development of potent anticancer drugs. The mitochondria-permeable drug DN401 is a newly identified in vivo pan-Hsp90 inhibitor with potent anticancer activity."

The profile hand bone measurements are derived from posteroanterior hand radiographs and are standardized for age and sex. Specific profiles have been developed for several syndromes. Therefore, MCPP analysis has developed from a method of describing changes in the hand to a technique useful in assigning a diagnosis to a specific syndrome and evaluation of skeletal development. The current status of MCPP analysis in clinical genetics, particularly with the Prader-Labhart-Willi and Sotos syndromes, is discussed."

Recombination, crossover in particular, shuffles mutations and impacts both the level of genetic polymorphism and the speed of adaptation. In many species, the recombination rate varies across the genome with hot and cold spots. The hotspot paradox hypothesis asserts that recombination hotspots are evolutionarily unstable due to self-destruction. However, the genomic landscape of double-strand breaks (DSBs), which initiate recombination, is evolutionarily conserved among divergent yeast species, casting doubt on the hotspot paradox hypothesis. Nonetheless, because only a subset of DSBs are associated with crossovers, the evolutionary conservation of the crossover landscape could differ from that of DSBs. Here, we investigate this possibility by generating a high-resolution recombination map of the budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus through whole-genome sequencing of 50 meiotic tetrads and by comparing this recombination map with that of S. cerevisiae. We observe a 40% lower recombination rate in S. paradoxus than in S. cerevisiae. Compared with the DSB landscape, the crossover landscape is even more conserved. Further analyses indicate that the elevated conservation of the crossover landscape is explained by a near-subtelomeric crossover preference in both yeasts, which we find to be attributable at least in part to crossover interference. We conclude that the yeast crossover landscape is highly conserved and that the evolutionary conservation of this landscape can differ from that of the DSB landscape."

The drug effect is measured by the clotting test prothrombin time and expressed as international normalized ratio. New direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly used in fixed-dose regimens but are licensed without any therapy monitoring. However, extensive clinical experiences have demonstrated that interindividual variations in the response to the therapy with direct oral anticoagulants do exist. In situations such as bleeding or thrombosis, therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful. Unfortunately, global coagulation assays such as the prothrombin time or the activated partial thrombin time are not suitable for this purpose. To measure drug concentrations, more specific coagulation test can be used if they are externally calibrated with the respective drugs. For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, a calibrated diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time can be used, whereas for anti-factor Xa drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, calibrated anti-factor Xa assays are appropriate. However, the gold standard to measure drug concentrations is LC-MS/MS. The variation in bleeding and thrombotic events noted with both drug classes under fixed-dose conditions suggests additional interindividual PD differences. Therefore, PD monitoring to individualize the therapy may be an option. For dabigatran, this is the inhibition of thrombin formation and for anti-factor Xa drugs, the inhibition of factor Xa activity, which can be followed using the functional assays mentioned above but without calibration. Alternatively, thrombin generation assays have been proposed for both drug classes. So far, not many clinical data have been published about the potentially beneficial effects of PD monitoring for dose individualization. The assay platforms for PD monitoring are present in many clinical laboratories, but efforts are needed to validate and standardize available assays to perform appropriate clinical trials."

In this study, we present an approach based on deep learning (DL) and dynamic programming (DP) to segment the bladder sac and measure the detrusor muscle thickness from transabdominal 2D B-mode ultrasound images. To assess the performance of our method, we compared the results of automated methods to the manually obtained reference bladder segmentations and wall thickness measurements of 80 images obtained from 11 volunteers. It takes less than a second to segment the bladder from a 2D B-mode image for the DL method. The average Dice index for the bladder segmentation is 0.93 \u00b1 0.04 mm, and the average root-mean-square-error and standard deviation for wall thickness measurement are 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 mm, which is comparable to the manual ground truth. The proposed fully automated and fast method could be a useful tool for segmentation and wall thickness measurement of the bladder from transabdominal B-mode images. The computation speed and accuracy of the proposed method will enable adaptive adjustment of the ultrasound focus point, and continuous assessment of the bladder wall during the filling and voiding process of the bladder."

The methyl donor betaine is depleted in the MS brain where it is linked to changes in levels of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and mitochondrial impairment. We investigated the effects of replacing this depleted betaine in the cuprizone mouse model of MS. Supplementation with betaine restored epigenetic control and alleviated neurological disability in cuprizone mice. Betaine increased the methylation potential (SAM/SAH ratio), levels of H3K4me3, enhanced neuronal respiration, and prevented axonal damage. We show that the methyl donor betaine and the betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) enzyme can act in the nucleus to repair epigenetic control and activate neuroprotective transcriptional programs. ChIP-seq data suggest that BHMT acts on chromatin to increase the SAM/SAH ratio and histone methyltransferase activity locally to increase H3K4me3 and activate transcriptional programs that support neuronal energetics. These data suggest that the methyl donor betaine may provide neuroprotection in MS where mitochondrial impairment damages axons and causes disability."

In this work, we studied cis-acting elements that eliminated the repression of GFP gene expression induced by Alu and ORF2 and sequence characteristics of these elements. We found that sense and antisense PolyA of simian virus 40 (SV40PolyA, 240 bp) eliminated the repression of GFP gene expression when inserted between the GFP gene and the Alu (283 bp) repeats or ORF2 (3825 bp) in pAlu14 (14 tandem Alu repeats were inserted downstream of the GFP gene in the vector pEGFP-C1) or pORF2. Antisense SV40PolyA (PolyAas) induced stronger gene expression than its sense orientation (PolyA). Of four 60-bp segments of PolyAas (1F1R, 2F2R, 3F3R and 4F4R) inserted independently into pAlu14, only two (2F2R and 3F3R) eliminated the inhibition of GFP gene expression induced by Alu repeats. Deletion analysis revealed that a 17 nucleotide AT repeat (17ntAT; 5'-AAAAAAATGCTTTATTT-3') in 2F2R and the fragment 3F38d9 (5'-ATAAACAAGTTAACAACA ACAATTGCATT-3') in 3F3R were critical sequences for activating the GFP gene. Sequence and structural analyses showed that 17ntAT and 3F38d9 included imperfect palindromes and may form a variety of unstable stem-loops. We suggest that the presence of imperfect palindromes and unstable stem-loops in DNA enhancer elements plays an important role in GFP gene activation."

A total of 4949 nonredundant proteins were identified, and 4495 were quantified using the iBAQ method. According to the iBAQ values, the BAT proteome was divided into high-, middle- and low-abundance proteins. The functions of the high-abundance proteins were mainly related to glucose and fatty acid oxidation to produce heat for thermoregulation, while the functions of the middle- and low-abundance proteins were mainly related to protein synthesis and apoptosis, respectively. Additionally, 497 proteins were predicted to have signal peptides using SignalP4 software, and 75 were confirmed in previous studies. This study, for the first time, comprehensively profiled and functionally annotated the BAT proteome. This study will be helpful for future studies focused on biomarker identification and BAT molecular mechanisms."

The etiology of dystrophic scoliosis in neurofibromatosis type 1 is not fully understood and therapies are lacking. Somatic mutations in NF1 have been shown in tibial pseudarthrosis providing rationale for similar processes in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated dystrophic scoliosis. Spinal samples from surgical procedures with matched peripheral blood of two individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 and dystrophic scoliosis were obtained and DNA extracted. Next generation sequencing of various spinal sections as well as the germline/blood sample were performed using a RASopathy gene panel (includes the NF1 gene). Variants were compared between the spinal tissue samples and the germline data. In addition, the next generation sequencing allele frequency data were used to detect somatic loss of heterozygosity. All samples had a detected potentially inactivating NF1 germline mutation. Both individuals demonstrated an allelic imbalance inclusive of NF1 in the next generation sequencing data. In addition, for the same two individuals, there was an increase in the % variant reads for the germline mutation in some of the surgical spinal samples corresponding to the allelic imbalance. Contra analysis did not show any deletion in Chromosome 17 next generation sequencing data. Microarray analysis verified somatic copy neutral loss of heterozygosity for these two individuals for the majority of the chromosome 17 q-arm, inclusive of the NF1 gene. These results suggest that the cause of dystrophic scoliosis is multifactorial and that a somatic NF1 mutation contributes to the etiology."

Anti-human IL-6R\u03b1 blockade by tocilizumab (TCZ) has been used in pig-to-baboon organ xenotransplant models, but whether it is beneficial remains uncertain. After xenotransplant, there were significant increases in both baboon and pig IL-6 in the baboon serum, especially in baboons that received TCZ before xenotransplant. In vitro observations demonstrated that human, baboon, and pig IL-6 can activate the IL-6/IL-6R\u03b1/STAT3 pathway in human, baboon, and pig cells, respectively. Activation of the IL-6/IL-6R\u03b1/STAT3 pathway was blocked by TCZ in human and baboon cells but not in pig cells (ie, pig IL-6R). Siltuximab (human IL-6 inhibitor) bound to both human and baboon, but not pig, IL-6 and suppressed activation of the IL-6/IL-6R\u03b1/STAT3 pathway. These results indicate that TCZ and siltuximab do not cross-react with pig IL-6R and pig IL-6, respectively. Rapamycin partially inhibited human, baboon, and pig IL-6/IL-6R\u03b1/STAT3 pathways and suppressed inflammatory gene expression. TCZ treatment increased serum IL-6 because it could no longer bind to baboon IL-6R\u03b1. We suggest that increased serum IL-6 may be detrimental to the pig xenograft because it is likely to bind to pig IL-6R, resulting in activation of pig cells."

Treatment of mice with trypan blue delayed their rejection of skin allografts and transplants of a highly antigenic syngeneic ultraviolet light-induced tumor. Trypan blue treatment of either donor or recipient decreased the local graft-versus-host reaction. Filtration of lymph node cells from trypan blue-treated donors on a nylon wool column before use in the graft-versus-host assay abrogated the depressive effect of trypan blue. A transient reduction in the blastogenic response of spleen cells to concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide mitogens was observed after a single injection of trypan blue, but the response of lymph node cells was unaffected. The depressed response of splenic lymphocytes was not entirely reversed by removal of adherent cells. The primary and secondary hemagglutinin responses to sheep erythrocytes were unaffected in trypan blue-treated mice, and the proportion and phagocytic activity of thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages were also unaltered. We conclude that treatment of mice with trypan blue selectively inhibits certain macrophage functions but, at high doses, it can also inhibit some lymphocyte activities."

In selected patients who have been clinically stabilized, switching to selexipag, a chemically distinct prostacyclin receptor agonist, may alleviate risks associated with long-term parenteral therapy. We report our experience with transition of patients from parenteral prostacyclin therapy to selexipag. From January 2016 to July 2017 patients with PAH at Duke University Pulmonary Vascular Disease Center with functional class II symptoms on stable parenteral prostacyclin therapy were offered the opportunity to transition to selexipag. A standardized protocol was developed to guide titration of therapies. Patients underwent pre- and post-transition assessments of hemodynamics, echocardiography, laboratory biomarkers, and functional status. We studied 14 patients with PAH (11 women; median age 53 years) in total. Overall, 13 patients tolerated the switch to selexipag and remained on the drug at study completion and 1 patient passed away due to progressive liver failure. Surrogate markers including NT-proBNP, 6MWD, RV function, TAPSE, and right heart catheterization hemodynamics were similar pre- and post-transition. The transition from parenteral prostanoid therapy to oral selexipag was overall well-tolerated in patients with stable PAH and functional class II symptoms. Finally, doses of selexipag up to 3200 mcg twice daily were well-tolerated in patients who had been treated with prior parenteral prostacyclins."

A polymorphic repetitive DNA domain, termed the uVNTR (upstream variable number tandem repeat), located at the promoter of the MAOA gene is a risk factor for many of these disorders. MAOA is on the X chromosome suggesting gender could play a role in regulation. We analysed MAOA regulation in the human female cell line, SH-SY5Y, which is polymorphic for the uVNTR. This heterozygosity allowed us to correlate allele-specific gene expression with allele-specific transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks for MAOA. Gene regulation was analysed under basal conditions and in response to the mood stabiliser sodium valproate. Both alleles were transcriptionally active under basal growth conditions; however, the alleles showed distinct transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks at their respective promoters. Exposure of the cells to sodium valproate resulted in differential allelic expression which correlated with allele-specific changes in distinct transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks at the region encompassing the uVNTR. Biochemically our model for MAOA promoter function has implications for gender differences in gene \u00d7 environment responses in which the uVNTR has been implicated as a genetic risk."

We recently began to collaborate with the RepeatsDB resource to improve the definition of tandem repeat families within Pfam. We carried out a significant comparison to the structural classification database, namely the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) that led to the creation of 825 new families based on their set of uncharacterized families\u00a0(EUFs). Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors' ORCID identifiers. This effectively permits authors to claim credit for their Pfam curation and link them to their ORCID record."

Inflammation has been implicated in ICH pathogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target for ICH. Haemin, an activator of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), rapidly increases HO-1 protein expression and activity and has been shown to distinctly affect anti-inflammatory functions after central nervous system (CNS) injury. However, less is known about the mechanisms that underlie the anti-inflammatory effects of haemin in aged rats post-ICH. Here, we performed microarray analysis to identify miRNAs that respond strongly to HO-1 regulation in ICH rats and found that miR-21-5p induced the most significant change. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we focused on dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) from the predicted miR-21-5p targets. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-21-5p bound directly to DUSP8. MiR-21-5p upregulation in vitro downregulated DUSP8 expression. Importantly, intracerebroventricularly injecting antagomir for miR-21-5p (A-miR-21-5p), which was used to inhibit miR-21-5p in aged ICH rats, significantly reduced the neurological defects, repaired cognitive impairment, alleviated blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, inhibited neuronal apoptosis posthaemorrhage and accelerated haematoma absorption. In addition, serum miR-21-5p levels were notably elevated in patients relative to healthy individuals and were correlated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and clinical outcomes. In summary, A-miR-21-5p increased HO-1 expression in cerebral haematomas, thus eliciting the DUSP8-modulated perifocal neuroprotective effect of haemin. MiR-21-5p with haemin therapy may be a potential therapy post-ICH."

To obtain insights into CF variants profile and frequency, we used the large population sequencing data in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We selected 207 CF-causing/varying clinical consequence variants from CFTR2 database and additional 15 variants submitted to the ClinVar database. Only 14 of these variants were found in the East-Asian population, while for South-Asian and African populations we identified 43 and 52 variants, respectively, confirming the peculiarity of the CFTR allelic spectrum with only few population-specific variants.

It has repeatedly been suggested that breast tumors from TP53 carriers are more likely to be HER2+ than those of non-carriers, but this information has not been incorporated into variant interpretation models for TP53. Breast tumor pathology is already being used quantitatively for assessing pathogenicity of germline variants in other genes, and it has been suggested that this type of evidence can be incorporated into current ACMG/AMP guidelines for germline variant classification. Here, by reviewing published data and using internal datasets separated by different age-groups, we investigated if breast tumor HER2+ status has utility as a predictor of TP53 germline variant pathogenicity, considering age at diagnosis. Overall, our results showed that the identification of HER2+ breast tumors diagnosed before the age of 40 can be conservatively incorporated into the current TP53-specific ACMG/AMP PP4 criterion, following a point system detailed in this manuscript. Further larger studies will be needed to re-assess the value of HER2+ breast tumors diagnosed at a later age. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes shrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early reports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to reduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor burden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional androgen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with single-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a combination study of orteronel with docetaxel. Recently, the ELM-PC5 Phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer who had received prior docetaxel was unblinded as the overall survival primary end point was not achieved. However, additional Phase III orteronel trials are ongoing in men with earlier stages of prostate cancer."

The BCR gene (chromosome 22q11.2) and the ABL1 gene (chromosome 9q34) fuse together due to reciprocal chromosome translocation forming the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). This fusion gene codes tyrosine kinase which accelerates the cell division and reduces DNA repair. Imatinib mesylate is a selective inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase. It is the first-line treatment for CML-patients. However, it became clear that Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) cells could evolve to elude inhibition due to point mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain. To date more than 40 mutations have been identified and their early detection is important for clinical treatment. With the development of the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), associated with these mutations, the resistance problem seems to diminish, as some of the new drugs are less prone to resistance. The aim of this review is to focus on the diff erent mutations leading to resistance."

However, whether the effect of afatinib on T790M acquisition differs from that of gefitinib when used clinically as first-line therapy remains unclear. To reaffirm the preclinical efficacy of afatinib on T790M-positive lung cancer cells, H1975 cells and established PC-9 cells resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib by T790M were used. In total, 398 patients with second biopsy at progression with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation, treated with afatinib or gefitinib as first-line therapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates. Afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies, which are resistant to gefitinib, but not those with high T790M allele frequencies. Afatinib and gefitinib showed similar efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) (11.5 vs 13.4\u202fmonths, P\u202f=\u202f.08) and overall survival (OS) (29.3 vs 28.5\u202fmonths, P\u202f=\u202f.76). T790M patients had better PFS and OS than those without T790M. There was no significant difference in the cumulative T790M acquisition ratio over time between afatinib and gefitinib (48.8% vs 59.3%, P\u202f=\u202f.317). The median time to acquire T790M was 12.9\u202fmonths for afatinib and 15.7\u202fmonths for gefitinib (P\u202f=\u202f.342). Although afatinib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells with low T790M allele frequencies in preclinical studies, this could not be translated into clinical efficacy in terms of lowering the rate or delaying the time of T790M acquisition."

RACK1 has been reported to regulate global miRNA biogenesis pathway in C. elegans, humans, and in Arabidopsis. RACK1 regulates different steps of miRNA biogenesis and stability in response to different stimuli in plants. miR393s is implicated in salt stress response pathway through an antagonistic response between the stress hormone ABA-mediated salt stress and growth hormone auxin. Specifically, the known auxin receptor clade transcripts TIR1/AFB2 are the target for the miR393s. By down-regulating the auxin signaling pathways, the miR393s inhibit the regulation of salt tolerance by auxin. Here we show that genetic loss of RACK1A- the predominant member of the three genes family of RACK1 in Arabidopsis, results in the inhibition of miR393 level causing the same salt sensitivities as the individual mir393a or mir393b or the double mutant mir393ab phenotypes. We propose that down-regulation of auxin signaling through RACK1A induced miR393 biogenesis potentially regulates the Arabidopsis acclimation to salinity. Our findings fill up a molecular gap in our understanding of the role of miR393 mediated ABA and auxin-regulated salt stress responses."

                    "context": "Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early onset disease requiring preterm delivery is associated with a higher risk of complications in both mothers and babies. Evidence suggests that the administration of low dose aspirin initiated prior to 16 weeks' gestation significantly reduces the rate of preterm preeclampsia. Therefore, it is important to identify pregnant women at risk of developing preeclampsia during the first trimester of pregnancy, thus allowing timely therapeutic intervention. Several professional organizations such as American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have proposed screening for preeclampsia based on maternal risk factors. The approach recommended by the ACOG and NICE essentially treats each risk factor as a separate screening test with additive detection rate and screen positive rate. Evidence has shown that preeclampsia screening based on the NICE and ACOG approach has suboptimal performance as the NICE recommendation only achieves detection rates of 41% and 34%, at 10% false positive rate, for preterm and term preeclampsia, respectively. Screening based on the ACOG (2013) recommendation can only achieve detection rates of 5% and 2% for preterm and term preeclampsia, respectively, at 0.2% false positive rate. Various first trimester prediction models have been developed. Most of them have not undergone or failed external validation. However, it is worthy of note that the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) first trimester prediction model (namely \"the triple test\"), which consists of a combination of maternal factors, and measurements of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and serum placental growth factor, has undergone successful internal and external validation. The FMF triple test has detection rates of 90% and 75% for the prediction of early and preterm preeclampsia, respectively, at 10% false positive rate. Such performance of screening is superior to that of the traditional method by maternal risk factors alone. The use of the FMF prediction model, followed by the administration of low dose aspirin, has been shown to reduce the rate of preterm preeclampsia by 62%. Number needed to screen to prevent one case of preterm preeclampsia by the FMF triple test is 250. The key to maintain optimal screening performance is to establish standardized protocols for biomarker measurements and regular biomarker quality assessment as inaccurate measurement can affect screening performance. Tools frequently used to assess quality control include the cumulative sums and target plot. Cumulative sums is a sensitive method to detect small shifts over time and point of shift can be easily identified. Target plot is a tool to evaluate deviation from expected multiple of median and expected median of standard deviation. Target plot is easy to interpret and visualize. However, it is insensitive to detect small deviation. Adherence to well-defined protocols for the measurements of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index and placental growth factor is required. This article summarizes the existing literature on the different methods, recommendations by professional organizations, quality assessment of different components of risk assessment and clinical implementation of the first trimester screening for preeclampsia."

The syndrome may affect infants, children, or young adults with strong positive family background of sudden cardiac death. Short QT syndrome is characterized by short QT and heart-rate-corrected QTc intervals. It is frequently associated with tall-, peaked-, and narrow-based T waves that are reminiscent of the typical \"desert tent\" T waves of hyperkalemia. There is a high tendency for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation due to the heterogeneous abbreviation of action potential duration and refractoriness of atrial myocytes. The arrhythmia can also be induced by programmed electrical stimulation. The safest treatment suggested is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, though the possibilities of inappropriate shocks have caused some concern, especially in teenagers. The ability of quinidine to prolong the QT interval has the potential to be an effective therapy for patients with short QT syndrome. This is particularly important in developing countries, where the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is not always available. Since these patients are at risk of sudden cardiac death from birth, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation has a lot of limitations in very young children, the utility of quinidine has to be evaluated further. Clinicians need to be aware of this deadly electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern as it portends a high risk of sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy subjects with structurally normal hearts."

Originally, mitochondria have been derived from bacteria. The main function of mitochondria is the production of ATP. However, this important organelle indirectly protects cells by consuming oxygen in the route of energy generation. It has been found that mitochondria are actively involved in the induction of the intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. So, there have been efforts to sustain mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibit its dysfunction. Notably, due to the potential role of mitochondria in the stimulation of apoptosis, this organelle is a promising target in cancer therapy. Resveratrol is a non-flavonoid polyphenol that exhibits significant pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor. The anti-tumor activity of resveratrol may be a consequence of its effect on mitochondria. Multiple studies have investigated the relationship between resveratrol and mitochondria, and it has been demonstrated that resveratrol is able to significantly enhance the concentration of reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequently, apoptosis induction. A number of signaling pathways such as sirtuin and NF-kB may contribute to the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by resveratrol. Besides, resveratrol shifts cellular metabolism from glycolysis into mitochondrial respiration to induce cellular death in cancer cells. In the present review, we discuss the possible interactions between resveratrol and mitochondria and its potential application in cancer therapy."

She was later diagnosed with synchronous glioblastoma, epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated lung adenocarcinoma, and HER2-negative breast cancer metastases. The patient was treated with local therapies, including brain surgery and radiotherapy, lung surgery, and a bilateral mastectomy, as well as with targeted systemic treatment. She proved to be highly sensitive to systemic therapy, and 13 years after the initial diagnosis of breast cancer and 6 years after the diagnosis of the two new primary tumors and recurrence of a prior cancer, she is alive with an excellent performance status. This surprising positive evolution may well be partly due to the pronged multidisciplinary approach to managing her disease and her extraordinary response to treatment: the lung adenocarcinoma showed excellent response to erlotinib; the breast cancer responded extremely well to eribulin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; and the glioblastoma has remained in response to surgery and radiotherapy. Despite harboring a TP53 mutation and having multiple tumors, this patient has shown an unexpectedly favorable evolution. The coordinated participation of a multidisciplinary team and the patient's own extraordinarily high sensitivity to systemic treatment played a major role in this evolution."

Although type I interferon (IFN-I) exerts broad-spectrum antiviral effects, its antiviral efficacy in host cells is largely restricted by viruses. How the antiviral efficacy of IFN-I can be improved remains to be explored. Here, we identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 11 (PARP11) as a potent regulator of IFN-I antiviral efficacy. PARP11 does not restrict IFN-I production induced by vesicular stomatitis virus or Sendai virus but inhibits the strength of IFN-I-activated signalling. Mechanistically, PARP11 mono-ADP-ribosylates the ubiquitin E3 ligase \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP). Mono-ADP-ribosylation of \u03b2-TrCP promotes IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, PARP11 expression is upregulated by virus infections, including vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus-1 and influenza A virus, thus promoting ADP-ribosylation-mediated viral evasion. We further highlight the potential for repurposing clinical ADP-ribosylation inhibitors. We found that rucaparib can target PARP11 to stabilize IFNAR1 and therefore exhibits efficient enhancement of IFN-I signalling and the host antiviral response. Consequently, rucaparib renders mice more resistant to viral infection. Our study updates the understanding of how \u03b2-TrCP regulates its substrates and may provide a druggable target for improving IFN antiviral efficacy."

Moreover, we show an inverse correlation between the presence of stress granules and the induction of IFN-stimulated proteins, i.e., MxA and USP18, in HCV-infected cells despite high-level expression of the corresponding MxA and USP18 mRNAs, suggesting that interferon-stimulated gene translation is inhibited in stress granule-containing HCV-infected cells. Finally, in short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown experiments, we found that the stress granule proteins T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA1-related protein (TIAR), and RasGAP-SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) are required for efficient HCV RNA and protein accumulation at early time points in the infection and that G3BP1 and TIA-1 are required for intracellular and extracellular infectious virus production late in the infection, suggesting that they are required for virus assembly. In contrast, TIAR downregulation decreases extracellular infectious virus titers with little effect on intracellular RNA content or infectivity late in the infection, suggesting that it is required for infectious particle release. Collectively, these results illustrate that HCV exploits the stress granule machinery at least two ways: by inducing the formation of SGs by triggering PKR phosphorylation, thereby downregulating the translation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes, and by co-opting SG proteins for its replication, assembly, and egress."

Heterozygous females typically have intermediate G6PD activity. G6PD deficiency has implications for the safe treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria. Individuals with this deficiency are at greater risk of serious adverse events following treatment with the only curative class of anti-malarials, 8-aminoquinolines, such as primaquine. Quantitative diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency are complex and require sophisticated laboratories. The commonly used qualitative tests, do not discriminate intermediate G6PD activities. This has resulted in poor understanding of the epidemiology of G6PD activity in females and its corresponding treatment ramifications. New simple-to-use quantitative tests, and a momentum to eliminate malaria, create an opportunity to address this knowledge gap. While this will require additional resources for clinical studies, adequate operational research, and appropriate pharmacovigilance, the health benefits from this investment go beyond the immediate intervention for which the G6PD status is first diagnosed."

Current protocell model membranes are proposed to be lipid-based. This paradigm has several shortcomings such as limited membrane stability of monoacyl lipid-based membranes (e.g., fatty acids), missing pathways to synthesize protocell membrane components (e.g., phospholipids) under early earth conditions, and the requirement for different classes of molecules for the formation of compartments and the catalysis of reactions. Amino acids on the other hand are known to arise and persist with remarkable abundance under early earth conditions since the fundamental Miller-Urey experiments. They were also postulated early to form protocellular structures, for example, proteinoid capsules. Here, we present a protocell model constituted by membranes assembled from amphiphilic proteins based on prebiotic amino acids. Self-assembled dynamic protein membrane-based compartments (PMBCs) are impressively stable and compatible with prevalent cellular membrane constituents forming protein-only or protein-lipid hybrid membranes. They can embed processes essential for extant living cells, such as enclosure of molecules, membrane fusion, phase separation, and complex biosynthetic elements from modern cells demonstrating \"upward\" compatibility. Our findings suggest that prebiotic PMBCs represent a new type of protocell as a possible ancestor of current lipid-based cells. The presented prebiotic PMBC model can be used to design artificial cells, important for the study of structural, catalytic, and evolutionary pathways related to the emergence of life."

Although clinically successful, bortezomib exhibits a relatively narrow therapeutic index and can induce dose-limiting toxicities such as thrombocytopenia. This study aims to develop a quantitative and predictive pharmacodynamic model to investigate bortezomib dosing-regimens in a rational and efficient manner. Mean temporal profiles of bortezomib pharmacokinetics, proteasome activity, M-protein concentrations, and platelet counts following bortezomib monotherapy were extracted from published clinical studies. A population-based meta-analysis of bortezomib anti-myeloma activity and thrombocytopenia was conducted sequentially with a Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization algorithm in Monolix. The final pharmacodynamic model integrates drug-target interactions and cell signaling dynamics with temporal biomarkers of clinical efficacy and toxicity. Bortezomib pharmacokinetics, disease progression, and platelet dynamic profiles were well characterized in MM patients, and a local sensitivity analysis of the final model suggests that increased proteasome concentration could ultimately attenuate bortezomib antineoplastic activity in MM patients. In addition, model simulations confirm that a once-weekly dosing schedule represents an optimal therapeutic regimen with comparable antineoplastic activity but significantly reduced risk of thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, a pharmacodynamic model was successfully developed, which provides a quantitative, mechanism-based platform for probing bortezomib dosing-regimens. Further research is needed to determine whether this model could be used to individualize bortezomib regimens to maximize antineoplastic efficacy and minimize thrombocytopenia during MM treatment."

All these entities are characterized by well-known alterations in the electrocardiogram and the first symptom of the disease may be an unexpected death. Despite the low prevalence of these diseases, the performance of an electrocardiogram in the first hours or days after birth could help identify these electrical disruptions and adopt preventive measures. In recent years, there has been an important impulse by some experts in the scientific community towards the initiation of a newborn electrocardiogram-screening program, for the detection of these electrocardiographic abnormalities. In addition, the use of genetic analysis in neonates could identify the cause of these heart alterations.

Nevertheless, WT also occurs in the context of more pleiotropic cancer predispositions, such as DICER1, Li-Fraumeni, and Bloom syndrome, as well as Fanconi anemia. Recent germline genomic investigations have increased our understanding of the host genetic factors that influence WT risk, with sequencing of rare familial cases and large WT cohorts revealing an expanding array of predisposition genes and associated genetic conditions. Here, we describe evidence implicating WT1, the 11p15 locus, and the recently identified genes CTR9, REST, and TRIM28 in WT predisposition. We discuss the clinical features, mode of inheritance, and biological aspects of tumorigenesis, when known. Despite these described associations, many cases of familial WT remain unexplained. Continued investigations are needed to fully elucidate the landscape of germline genetic alterations in children with WT. Establishing a genetic diagnosis is imperative for WT families so that individuals harboring a predisposing germline variant can undergo surveillance, which should enable the early detection of tumors and use of less intensive treatments, thereby leading to improved overall outcomes."

The efficiency of daratumumab might be improved by combining it with synergistic anti-MM agents. We therefore investigated the potential of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor ricolinostat to up-regulate CD38 on MM cells, thereby enhancing the performance of CD38-specific therapies. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, we observed that ricolinostat significantly increases CD38 RNA levels and CD38 surface expression on MM cells. Super-resolution microscopy imaging of MM cells by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy confirmed this rise with molecular resolution and revealed homogeneous distribution of CD38 molecules on the cell membrane. Particularly important is that combining ricolinostat with daratumumab induced enhanced lysis of MM cells. We also evaluated next-generation HDAC6 inhibitors (ACY-241, WT-161) and observed similar increase of CD38 levels suggesting that the upregulation of CD38 expression on MM cells by HDAC6 inhibitors is a class effect. This proof-of-concept illustrates the potential benefit of combining HDAC6 inhibitors and CD38-directed immunotherapy for MM treatment."

One of the forms of colorectal cancer is hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as \"Lynch syndrome\". It is the most common hereditary form of cancer accounting for 5%-10% of all colon cancers. HNPCC is a dominant autosomal genetic disorder caused by germ line mutations in mismatch repair genes. Human mismatch repair genes play a crucial role in genetic stability of DNA, the inactivation of which results in an increased rate of mutation and often a loss of mismatch repair function. Recent studies have shown that certain mismatch repair genes are involved in the regulation of key cellular processes including apoptosis. Thus, differential expression of mismatch repair genes particularly the contributions of MLH1 and MSH2 play important roles in therapeutic resistance to certain cytotoxic drugs such as cisplatin that is used normally as chemoprevention. An understanding of the role of mismatch repair genes in molecular signaling mechanism of apoptosis and its involvement in HNPCC needs attention for further work into this important area of cancer research, and this review article is intended to accomplish that goal of linkage of apoptosis with HNPCC. The current review was not intended to provide a comprehensive enumeration of the entire body of literature in the area of HNPCC or mismatch repair system or apoptosis; it is rather intended to focus primarily on the current state of knowledge of the role of mismatch repair proteins in molecular signaling mechanism of apoptosis as it relates to understanding of HNPCC."

To see whether or not the single-chain antibody could bind and inactivate infectious virus in vivo, we have used recombinant Sindbis virus as a delivery vehicle for intracellular expression of the antibody fragment. The variable genes and interchain linker encoding the single-chain antibody were cloned into a double subgenomic Sindbis virus expression vector to generate recombinant Sindbis virus. Infection with this recombinant Sindbis virus provided high-level cytoplasmic expression of the antibody fragment in mammalian cells. We demonstrate (i) that the antibody fragment was antigen binding and (ii) that louping ill virus infectivity was significantly reduced in the presence of intracellular antibody expressed by the superinfecting recombinant Sindbis virus."

While inactivating mutations in the CLN1 gene, encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterases-1 (PPT1), cause infantile NCL (INCL), those in the CLN3 gene, encoding a protein of unknown function, underlie juvenile NCL (JNCL). PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins (constituents of ceroid) required for their degradation by lysosomal hydrolases and PPT1-deficiency causes lysosomal accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid leading to INCL. Because intracellular accumulation of ceroid is a characteristic of all NCLs, a common pathogenic link for these diseases has been suggested. It has been reported that CLN3-mutations suppress the exit of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) from the trans Golgi network (TGN). Because CI-M6PR transports soluble proteins such as PPT1 from the TGN to the lysosome, we hypothesized that CLN3-mutations may cause lysosomal PPT1-insufficiency contributing to JNCL pathogenesis. Here, we report that the lysosomes in Cln3-mutant mice, which mimic JNCL, and those in cultured cells from JNCL patients, contain significantly reduced levels of Ppt1-protein and Ppt1-enzyme activity and progressively accumulate autofluorescent ceroid. Furthermore, in JNCL fibroblasts the V0a1 subunit of v-ATPase, which regulates lysosomal acidification, is mislocalized to the plasma membrane instead of its normal location on lysosomal membrane. This defect dysregulates lysosomal acidification, as we previously reported in Cln1 "

Thanks to the effectiveness of national screening programs, the incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer have declined dramatically in developed countries. According to many researchers, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has an important role in the development of cervical neoplasm. The effects of HPV infection on the oncogenesis of cervical carcinoma can be explained to a large degree by the regulation and function of the two viral oncogenes, E6 and E7. About 25 of >80 types infect the genital tract. HPV types are stratified into low, intermediate- and high-risk categories. Today, vaccines are available against many serious human pathogens. It is accepted worldwide that cervical carcinoma is a consequence of infection with HPV viruses. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that vaccine that prevents infection will reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Virus-like particles are empty viral capsids, and are the leading candidate vaccines for the treatment or prevention of cervical cancer in humans. The HPV type 16 (HPV16) L1 virus-like particle vaccines have been shown to be generally well tolerated and they generate high levels of antibodies against HPV16. Since approximately 50% of cervical cancers are associated with HPV16 infection, the administration of this type of vaccine to young women could reduce the incidence of HPV16 infection, which is related to cervical dysplasia and cervical neoplasm. Vaccination against HPV infection could reduce the risk of infection and, most importantly, decrease the incidence of cervical cancer. A vaccine for cervical cancer is not a dream in the far future, it is happening today."

During puncture, sudden cardiovascular arrest occurred. The CT scan documented severe arterial gas embolism in the aorta, spinal canal, left heart ventricle, and brain. The patient was then transferred to our hospital for HBOT. After the first HBOT, an additional CT scan showed regression of all gas inclusions. In the treatment of gas embolism, HBOT is considered the gold standard and is indispensable. It is primarily used to reduce acute bubble effects and to avoid secondary bubble effects. Unfortunately, the long persisting gas occlusions and perfusion deficits led to severe hypoxic brain damage and a poor prognosis for the patient. In this case report we present the management of (iatrogenic) arterial gas embolism and point out the necessity of immediate HBOT.

Cellular mechanisms of hyperglycemia and chemotherapy efficacy may be different depending upon the particular cancer type and the condition of the patient. This review evaluates the effect of DM on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and adverse drug reactions of commonly used anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and adriamycin in both clinical and animal models. A literature search was conducted in scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar including the relevant keywords. The results of the effectiveness of anticancer therapies in patients with DM are, however, inconsistent because DM can negatively impact multiple diverse entities including nerves and vascular structures, insulin-like growth factor 1, the function of the innate immune system, drug pharmacokinetics, the expression levels of hepatic CYP"

Therefore, here we used RNA sequencing data from human, pig and mouse during early embryonic development to detect edited genes that may regulate stem cell pluripotency. We observed that although most of the RNA editing sites are located in intergenic, intron and UTR, a few editing sites are in coding regions and may result in nonsynonymous amino acid changes. Some editing sites are predicted to change the structure of a protein. We also report that HNF1A, TBX3, ACLY, ECI1 and ERDR1 are related to embryonic development and cell division."

Some patients develop systemic side effects that preclude them from continuing a therapy that may have been efficacious, or in other cases, current medical therapies are not adequate to control disease. Nanotechnology is an emerging field where particles, in the size of nanometers, can be used to deliver medications directly to the area of inflammation thus avoiding drug-associated systemic side effects. When using nanoparticles (NPs), only a small amount of the drug is needed, and it can be delivered directly to the inflamed site without exposure to the rest of the body.

Furthermore, published epigenomic profiles are not specific to H3K36me3 or metastatic tumors. To determine if progressive SETD2 and H3K36me3 dysregulation occurs in metastatic tumors, H3K36me3, SETD2 copy number (CN) or SETD2 mRNA abundance was assessed in two independent cohorts: metastatic ccRCC (n=71) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma data set (n=413). Although SETD2 CN loss occurs with high frequency (>90%), H3K36me3 is not significantly impacted by monoallelic loss of SETD2. H3K36me3-positive nuclei were reduced an average of ~20% in primary ccRCC (90% positive nuclei in uninvolved vs 70% positive nuclei in ccRCC) and reduced by ~60% in metastases (90% positive in uninvolved kidney vs 30% positive in metastases) (P<0.001). To define a kidney-specific H3K36me3 profile, we generated genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles from four cytoreductive nephrectomies and SETD2 isogenic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing. SETD2 loss of methyltransferase activity leads to regional alterations of H3K36me3 associated with aberrant RNA splicing in a SETD2 mutant RCC and SETD2 knockout cell line. These data suggest that during progression of ccRCC, a decline in H3K36me3 is observed in distant metastases, and regional H3K36me3 alterations influence alternative splicing in ccRCC. "

Here, we portray the biophysical characterization of Sus1 from S. cerevisiae. The recombinant Sus1 is a \u03b1-helical structure which is stable at various pH conditions. We reported the \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet transition at the low pH as well as at high pH. Sus1 showed 50% reduction in the fluorescence intensity at pH-2 as compared to native protein. The fluorescence studies demonstrated the unfolding of tertiary structure of the protein with variation in pH as compared to neutral pH. The same results were obtained in the ANS binding and acrylamide quenching studies. Similarly, the secondary structure of the Sus1 was found to be stable till 55% alcohol concentration while tertiary structure was stable up to 20% alcohol concentration. Further increase in the alcohol concentration destabilizes the secondary as well as tertiary structure. The 300 mM concentration of ammonium sulfate also stabilizes the secondary structure of the protein. The structural characterization of this protein is expected to unfold the process of the transportation of the mRNA with cooperation of different proteins."

We conducted a 4-week, open label, pilot study of isradipine, a calcium channel blocker, to determine its feasibility, safety, and efficacy in improving cognition in SZ patients. Ten adults with stable SZ were started on a flexible dose of isradipine 5\u00a0mg/day (up to 10\u00a0mg/day) for 4\u00a0weeks. Weekly in-person visits tracked side effects and symptoms while neurocognition and functional capacity were assessed at baseline and week 4. There were no serious adverse events reported.

Treatment did not exacerbate clinical symptoms.

Iron obtained from daily diet is passed through the intestinal enterocyte apical membrane via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which is either stored as ferritin or moved into the plasma by hepcidin-ferroportin (Fpn) as an exporter. Hepcidin (hepatic bactericidal protein) is a cysteine rich peptide, was initially identified as a urinary antimicrobial peptide. It contains 25 amino acids and four disulfide bridges. It has significant role in regulation of iron in the body. Stimulation of iron in plasma and further its storage is linked with the production of hepcidin. This enhancement of iron hampers the absorption of iron from the diet. The cause of hereditary recessive anemia also known as Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is characterized by increased hepcidin production due to a gene mutation in the suppressor matriptase-2/TMPRSS6. During infection, hepcidin plays a defensive role against various infections by depleting the extracellular iron from the body. Moreover, hepcidin lowers the concentrations of iron from the duodenal enterocytes, macrophages and also decrease its transport across the placenta.The current review highlights the significant role of hepcidin in the iron homeostasis and as an antimicrobial agent."

However, thyroid hormone levels are basically normal in patients with Pendred syndrome, indicating the presence of another unknown iodide transporter. Here, we show that SLC26A7 is a novel iodide transporter in the thyroid. We observe that SLC26A7 is specifically expressed in normal thyroid tissues and demonstrate its function in iodide transport. Using whole-exome sequencing, we also find a homozygous nonsense mutation in SLC26A7 (c.1498 C\u2009>\u2009T; p.Gln500Ter) in two siblings with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism. The mutated SLC26A7 protein shows an abnormal cytoplasmic localisation and lacks the iodide transport function. These results reveal that SLC26A7 functions as a novel iodide transporter in the thyroid and its dysfunction affects thyroid hormonogenesis in humans and causes congenital goitrous hypothyroidism."

However, how Haspin and Bub1 collaborate to control Aurora B activity at centromeres remains unclear. Here, we show that either Haspin or Bub1 activity is sufficient to recruit Aurora B to a distinct chromosomal locus. Moreover, we identified a small, Bub1 kinase-dependent Aurora B pool that supported faithful chromosome segregation in otherwise unchallenged cells. Joined inhibition of Haspin and Bub1 activities fully abolished Aurora B accumulation at centromeres. While this impaired the correction of erroneous KT-MT attachments, it did not compromise the mitotic checkpoint, nor the phosphorylation of the Aurora B kinetochore substrates Hec1, Dsn1, and Knl1. This suggests that Aurora B substrates at the kinetochore are not phosphorylated by centromere-localized pools of Aurora B, and calls for a reevaluation of the current spatial models for how tension affects Aurora B-dependent kinetochore phosphorylation."

We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution."

In addition, KDM4D interacts physically and functionally with both NFIB and MLL1 complex to regulate C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 expression upon adipogenic hormonal induction. Although KDM4D is dispensable for the binding of both NFIB and MLL1 complex to the target promoters, the demethylation of tri-methylated H3K9 by KDM4D is required for NFIB and MLL1 complex to deposit tri-methylated H3K4 and activate PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 expression. Taken together, our data provide a molecular framework for lineage-specific transcription factor and histone modifiers to cooperate in adipogenic differentiation, in which KDM4D removes repressive histone marks at genes with a bivalent chromatin domain and allows NFIB and MLL1 complex to promote the expression of key adipogenic regulators."

Additionally, this class of drug promotes gene delivery by facilitating lentiviral vector entry into cells, revealing its potential to improve gene therapy efforts. However, the precise mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that mTOR inhibitor treatment results in down-regulation of the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITM proteins, especially IFITM3, are potent inhibitors of virus-cell fusion and are broadly active against a range of pathogenic viruses. We found that the effect of rapamycin treatment on lentiviral transduction is diminished upon IFITM silencing or knockout in primary and transformed cells, and the extent of transduction enhancement depends on basal expression of IFITM proteins, with a major contribution from IFITM3. The effect of rapamycin treatment on IFITM3 manifests at the level of protein, but not mRNA, and is selective, as many other endosome-associated transmembrane proteins are unaffected. Rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3 requires endosomal trafficking, ubiquitination, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, and lysosomal acidification. Since IFITM proteins exhibit broad antiviral activity, we show that mTOR inhibition also promotes infection by another IFITM-sensitive virus, Influenza A virus, but not infection by Sendai virus, which is IFITM-resistant. Our results identify the molecular basis by which mTOR inhibitors enhance virus entry into cells and reveal a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive feature of these clinically important drugs. In addition, this study uncovers a functional convergence between the mTOR pathway and IFITM proteins at endolysosomal membranes."

Several KLK transcripts have been found aberrantly expressed in numerous human malignancies, confirming their prognostic or/and diagnostic values. However, the process of alternative splicing can now be studied in-depth due to the development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). In the present study, we used NGS to discover novel transcripts of the KLK1 and KLK2 genes, after nested touchdown PCR. Bioinformatics analysis and PCR experiments revealed a total of eleven novel KLK transcripts (two KLK1 and nine KLK2 transcripts). In addition, the expression profiles of each novel transcript were investigated with nested PCR experiments using variant-specific primers. Since KLKs are implicated in human malignancies, qualifying as potential biomarkers, the quantification of the presented novel transcripts in human samples may have clinical applications in different types of cancer."

In the past, Wernicke's encephalopathy was described almost exclusively in the alcohol-dependent population. However, in current times, Wernicke's encephalopathy is also well recognized in many other patient groups, including patients following bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, cancer and pancreatitis. Early recognition of Wernicke's encephalopathy is vital, as prompt treatment can restore cognitive or ocular function and can prevent permanent disability. Unfortunately, Wernicke's encephalopathy is often undiagnosed - presumably because it is relatively uncommon and has a variable clinical presentation. Clinical biochemists have a unique role in advising clinicians about potential nutritional or metabolic causes of unexplained neurological symptoms and to prompt consideration of thiamine deficiency as a potential cause in high-risk patient groups. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy and to highlight some non-traditional causes, such as after bariatric surgery."

The NADPH oxidases are a family of ROS generating enzymes, of which four members (Nox1, Nox2, Nox4 and Nox5) are expressed in blood vessels. Numerous studies have demonstrated that expression and activity of at least two isoforms of NADPH oxidase - Nox1 and Nox2 - are up-regulated in animal models of hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. However, these observations are merely suggestive of a role for NADPH oxidases in vessel pathology and by no means establish cause and effect. Furthermore, questions surrounding the specificity of current pharmacological inhibitors of NADPH oxidase mean that findings obtained with these compounds must be viewed with caution. Here, we review the literature on studies utilising genetically-modified mouse strains to investigate the roles of NADPH oxidases in experimental models of vascular disease. While several studies on transgenic over-expressing or knockout mice support roles for Nox1- and/or Nox2-containing oxidases as sources of excessive vascular ROS production and causes of endothelial dysfunction in hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes, there are still no published reports on the effects of genetic modification of Nox4 or Nox5 in vascular or indeed any other contexts. Further understanding of the roles of specific isoforms of NADPH oxidase in vascular (patho)physiology should provide direction for future programs aimed at developing selective inhibitors of these enzymes as novel therapeutics in cardiovascular disease."

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that two cis-acting signals are required for efficient RNA processing in HTLV-I LTR: (i) a remote AAUAAA hexamer at a distance of 276 nucleotides upstream of the polyadenylation site, and (ii) the 20-nucleotide GU-rich sequence immediately downstream from the poly(A) site. It has been postulated that the folding of RNA into a secondary structure juxtaposes the AAUAAA sequence, in a noncontiguous manner, to within 14 nucleotides of the polyadenylation site. To test this hypothesis, we introduced deletions and point mutations within the U3 and R regions of the LTR. RNA 3'-end processing occurred efficiently at the authentic HTLV-I poly(A) site after deletion of the sequences predicted to form the secondary structure. Thus, the genetic analysis supports the hypothesis that folding of the HTLV-I RNA in the U3 and R regions juxtaposes the AAUAAA sequence and the poly(A) site to the correct functional distance. This unique arrangement of RNA-processing signals is also found in the related retroviruses HTLV-II and bovine leukemia virus."

Biologics targeting them have already achieved considerable clinical success in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or transplant recipients (e.g., abatacept, belatacept, and belimumab) as well as cancer (e.g., ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab). In view of such progress, there have been only relatively limited efforts toward developing small-molecule PPI inhibitors (SMPPIIs) targeting these cosignaling interactions, possibly because they, as all other PPIs, are difficult to target by small molecules and were not considered druggable. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been achieved during the last decade. SMPPIIs proving the feasibility of such approaches have been identified through various strategies for a number of cosignaling interactions including CD40-CD40L, OX40-OX40L, BAFFR-BAFF, CD80-CD28, and PD-1-PD-L1s. Here, after an overview of the general aspects and challenges of SMPPII-focused drug discovery, we review them briefly together with relevant structural, immune-signaling, physicochemical, and medicinal chemistry aspects. While so far only a few of these SMPPIIs have shown activity in animal models (DRI-C21045 for CD40-D40L, KR33426 for BAFFR-BAFF) or reached clinical development (RhuDex for CD80-CD28, CA-170 for PD-1-PD-L1), there is proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of such approaches in immunomodulation. They can result in products that are easier to develop/ manufacture and are less likely to be immunogenic or encounter postmarket safety events than corresponding biologics, and, contrary to them, can even become orally bioavailable."

It is tedious to generate these three results and manually put them together; moreover, it may eventually lead to inaccuracies. On the other hand, genotype markers are usually detected by DNA- and/or RNA-Seq. For GWAS analysis based on RNA-Seq, markers from DNA-Seq provide more genetic information when displaying LD. The currently released software package does not have this function for an integrated analysis of LD, using genotypic markers different from that in association analysis.

One region of Xq26.2 comprises the genes GPC3 and GPC4; deletion or duplication of this region has been recently been shown to result in overgrowth, specifically Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. We describe a male patient with two maternally inherited Xq26 microduplications; the first was 0.8 Mb at Xq26.2 affecting only GPC3 and GPC4, and the second, a distal 0.6 Mb duplication at Xq26.3 affecting seven genes. Rather than having Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, our patient had microcephaly and undergrowth, with development that was within normal limits at 25 months of age. This finding suggests that the molecular pathway leading to overgrowth secondary to GPC3/GPC4 haploinsufficiency can be overpowered by a disruption to the distal Xq26.3 region. Of the genes in that region, we propose that SLC9A6 is the most likely to play an important role as mutations in this gene lead to Christianson syndrome, in which patients may have microcephaly and weight loss."

The failures of several amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (A\u03b2) hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial, providing important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target. However, the inconsistent results observed with aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble A\u03b2 oligomers, which are implicated as upstream drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can effectively inhibit A\u03b2 oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is ALZ-801, an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration that can robustly inhibit A\u03b2 oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this amyloid oligomer hypothesis."

In 2017 and 2018, there were outbreaks of polio in Syria and Papua New Guinea due to circulating VDPVs, after many years of these countries remaining free of polio due to wild polioviruses.

Decades later there is continued interest in Paneth cells as they play an integral role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and modulating the physiology of the small intestine and its associated microbial flora. Paneth cells are highly specialized secretory epithelial cells located in the small intestinal crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn. The dense granules produced by Paneth cells contain an abundance of antimicrobial peptides and immunomodulating proteins that function to regulate the composition of the intestinal flora. This in turn plays a significant role in secondary regulation of the host microvasculature, the normal injury and repair mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial layer, and the levels of intestinal inflammation. These critical functions may have even more importance in the immature intestine of premature infants. While Paneth cells begin to develop in the middle of human gestation, they do not become immune competent or reach their adult density until closer to term gestation. This leaves preterm infants deficient in normal Paneth cell biology during the greatest window of susceptibility to develop intestinal pathology such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). As 10% of infants worldwide are currently born prematurely, there is a significant population of infants contending with an inadequate cohort of Paneth cells. Infants who have developed NEC have decreased Paneth cell numbers compared to age-matched controls, and ablation of murine Paneth cells results in a NEC-like phenotype suggesting again that Paneth cell function is critical to homeostasis to the immature intestine. This review will provide an up to date and comprehensive look at Paneth cell ontogeny, the impact Paneth cells have on the host-microbial axis in the immature intestine, and the repercussions of Paneth cell dysfunction or loss on injury and repair mechanisms in the immature gut."

In this work, we further investigated the role of this growth factor in quail trunk NC morphogenesis and demonstrated its huge effect in NCC growth mainly by stimulating cell proliferation but also reducing cell death, despite that NCC migration from the neural tube explant was not affected. Moreover, following FGF2 treatment, reduced expression of the early NC markers Sox10 and FoxD3 and improved proliferation of HNK1-positive NCC were observed. Since these markers are involved in the regulation of glial and melanocytic fate of NC, the effect of FGF2 on NCC differentiation was investigated. Therefore, in the presence of FGF2, increased proportions of NCCs positives to the melanoblast marker Mitf as well as NCCs double stained to Mitf and BrdU were recorded. In addition, treatment with FGF2, followed by differentiation medium, resulted in increased expression of melanin and improved proportion of melanin-pigmented melanocytes without alteration in the glial marker Schwann myelin protein (SMP). Taken together, these data further reveal the important role of FGF2 in NCC proliferation, survival, and differentiation, particularly in melanocyte development. This is the first demonstration of FGF2 effects in melanocyte commitment of NC and in the proliferation of Mitf-positive melanoblasts. Elucidating the differentiation process of embryonic NCCs brings us a step closer to understanding the development of the PNS and then undertaking the search for advanced technologies to prevent, or treat, injuries caused by NC-related disorders, also known as neurocristopathies."

However, it remains unclear whether the subcellular localization of mutated proteins influences the efficiency of T-cell priming. To address this question we compared the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 and OVA localized either in the cytosol or in mitochondria. We showed that tumors expressing mitochondrial-localized NY-ESO-1 and OVA proteins elicit significantly higher frequencies of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo. We also demonstrated that this stronger immune response is dependent on the mitochondrial location of the antigenic proteins, which contributes to their higher steady state amount, compared with cytosolic-localized proteins. Consistent with these findings, we showed that injection of mitochondria purified from B16 melanoma cells can protect mice from a challenge with B16 cells, but not with irrelevant tumors. Finally, we extended these findings to cancer patients by demonstrating the presence of T-cell responses specific for mutated mitochondrial-localized proteins. These findings highlight the utility of prioritizing epitopes derived from mitochondrial-localized mutated proteins as targets for cancer vaccination strategies."

In this article, we describe the Korean Reference Genome Database (KRGDB) and its genome browser. The current version of our database contains both single nucleotide and short insertion/deletion variants. The DNA samples were obtained from four different origins and sequenced in different sequencing depths (10\u00d7 coverage of 63 individuals, 20\u00d7 coverage of 194 individuals, combined 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 coverage of 135 individuals, 30\u00d7 coverage of 230 individuals and 30\u00d7 coverage of 1100 individuals). The major features of the KRGDB are that it contains information on the Korean genomic variant frequency, frequency difference between the Korean and other populations and the variant functional annotation (such as regulatory elements in ENCODE regions and coding variant functions) of the variant sites. Additionally, we performed the genome-wide association study (GWAS) between Korean genome variant sites for the 30\u00d7230 individuals and three major common diseases (diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome). The association results are displayed on our browser.

Recent studies revealed that individual ETC complexes are assembled into supercomplexes. The main supercomplex, respirasome composed of complexes I, III, and IV has been suggested to improve electron channeling and control ROS production, maintain the structural integrity of ETC complexes and prevent protein aggregation in the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, many questions related to the structural organization of the respirasome, particularly, a possible role of complexes I and II in respirasome formation remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether genetic and pharmacological inhibition of complexes I and II affect respirasome assembly in cardioblast cells and isolated cardiac mitochondria. Pharmacological inhibition of the enzymatic activity of complexes I and II stimulated disruption of the respirasome. Likewise, knockdown of the complex I subunit NDUFA11 stimulated dissociation of respirasome and reduced the activity of complexes I, III, and IV. However, silencing of the membrane-anchored SDHC subunit of complex II had no effect on the respirasome assembly but reduced the activity of complexes II and IV. Downregulation of NDUFA11 or SDHC reduced ATP production and increased mitochondrial ROS production. Overall, these studies, for the first time, provide biochemical evidence that the complex I activity, and the NDUFA11 subunit are important for assembly and stability of the respirasome. The SDHC subunit of complex II is not involved in the respirasome however the complex may play a regulatory role in respirasome formation."

In the present study, we investigated the correlation between intracellular imatinib concentrations in leukocytes, plasma imatinib levels, and genotypes of drug transporters, including ATP binding cassette B1 (ABCB), ABCG2, solute carrier 22A1 (SLC22A1), solute carrier organic anion transporter family members 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and SLCO1B3. The imatinib levels in leukocytes were determined using HPLC in 15 patients with chronic phase CML. No significant correlation between intracellular and plasma concentrations of imatinib was observed. The intracellular concentration was comparable in both patients with or without complete cytogenetic response. The intracellular imatinib concentration was significantly higher in patients with SLCO1B3 334TT than in those with 334TG/GG (p=0.0188). Plasma concentrations were similar in both SLCO1B3 genotypes (p=0.860), thereby resulting in the intracellular to plasma concentration ratio being higher in patients with SLCO1B3 334TT than those with 334 TG/GG (p=0.0502). These results suggested that the SLCO1B3 334T>G polymorphism could have a significant impact on the intracellular concentration of imatinib in leukocytes as a promising biomarker for personalized treatment of CML patients."

One antisense drug, nusinersen, has been approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Importantly, nusinersen improves disease symptoms when administered to symptomatic patients rather than just slowing the progression of the disease. In addition to the benefit to spinal muscular atrophy patients, there are discoveries from nusinersen that can be applied to other neurological diseases, including method of delivery, doses, tolerability of intrathecally delivered antisense drugs, and the biodistribution of intrathecal dosed antisense drugs.

Here, to understand how the principal neurons in different brain regions cope with moderate, chronically present levels of A\u03b2, we employed transgenic mice expressing equal levels of mouse and human APP carrying a combination of three familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London), that develop plaques only in old age. We analyzed dendritic spine parameters in hippocampal and cortical brain regions after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging, followed by algorithm-based evaluation of mice of both sexes from adolescence to old age.

Our study aimed to detect differentially methylated genes associated with ER\u03b2 expression, which could point to mechanisms by which ER\u03b2 could influence risk and prognosis of CRC. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k BeadChip arrays in two independent tumour sample sets of CRC patients recruited in 2003-2010 by the German DACHS study (discovery cohort n =\u00a0917, replication cohort n =\u00a0907). ER\u03b2 expression was measured using immunohistochemistry and scored as negative, moderate and high. Differentially methylated CpG sites and genomic regions were determined using limma in the R-package RnBeads. For the comparison of tumours with moderate/high ER\u03b2 versus negative expression, differentially methylated CpG sites were identified but not confirmed by replication. Comparing tumours of high with tumours of negative ER\u03b2 expression revealed 2,904 differentially methylated CpG sites of which 403 were replicated (FDR adjusted p-value<0.05). Replicated CpGs were annotated to genes such as CD36, HK1 or LRP5. A survival analysis indicates that 30 of the replicated CpGs are also associated with overall survival (FDR-adjusted p-value<0.05). The regional analysis identified 60 differentially methylated promotor regions. The epigenome-wide analysis identified both novel genes as well as genes already implicated in CRC. Follow-up mechanistic studies to better understand the regulatory role of ER\u03b2 could inform potential targets for improving treatment or prevention of CRC."

This database includes a comprehensive collection of A-to-I editing sites in six filamentous fungal species, together with extensive annotations for each editing site. In FairBase, users can conveniently search editing sites and obtain editing levels for each editing site in various RNA-seq samples. In addition, the pathways involving RNA editing are built in FairBase to help users understand the functions of RNA editing.

However, cryptic Y chromosome material is suggested to be a risk factor for gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Here, we aimed to estimate the frequency of cryptic Y chromosome material in patients with Turner syndrome and determine whether Y chromosome material increased the risk for development of gonadoblastoma. A total of 124 patients who were diagnosed with Turner syndrome by conventional cytogenetic techniques underwent additional molecular analysis to detect cryptic Y chromosome material. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome harboring Y chromosome cell lines had their ovaries removed prophylactically. Finally, we assessed the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Molecular analysis demonstrated that 10 patients had Y chromosome material among 118 patients without overt Y chromosome (8.5%). Six patients with overt Y chromosome and four patients with cryptic Y chromosome material underwent oophorectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed that the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in the total group was 2.4%, and gonadoblastoma occurred in one of six patients with an overt Y chromosome (16.7%) and 2 of 10 patients with cryptic Y chromosome material (20.0%). The risk of developing gonadoblastoma in patients with cryptic Y chromosome material was similar to that in patients with overt Y chromosome. Therefore, molecular screening for Y chromosome material should be recommended for all patients with Turner syndrome to detect individuals at a high risk of gonadoblastoma and to facilitate proper management of the disease."

Here we show that Drosha cleavage occurs during transcription acting on both independently transcribed and intron-encoded miRNAs. We also show that both 5'-3' and 3'-5' exonucleases associate with the sites where co-transcriptional Drosha cleavage occurs, promoting intron degradation before splicing. We finally demonstrate that miRNAs can also derive from 3' flanking transcripts of Pol II genes. Our results demonstrate that multiple miRNA-containing transcripts are co-transcriptionally cleaved during their synthesis and suggest that exonucleolytic degradation from Drosha cleavage sites in pre-mRNAs may influence the splicing and maturation of numerous mRNAs."

The five exons of the gene together with the exon-intron boundaries and part of the promoter region were sequenced. Mutations were found in a total of 14 patients (47%) while no mutation was identified in the sequenced regions in 53% of patients. Fourteen different mutations were identified of which eight were novel while six had been previously reported. Mutations were mainly seen in patients with clinical findings, suggestive of OCA1A (64% of patients with OCA1A versus 25% of patients with OCA1B); therefore, the absence of mutations in some of the other patients may indicate the involvement of other genes."

Near-total loss of subcutaneous fat was confirmed by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory data revealed significant hypertriglyceridemia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and heavy proteinuria with stage IIIa chronic kidney disease. Her blood film revealed thrombocytosis that on further evaluation by bone marrow biopsy was confirmed to be a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN); essential thrombocytosis (ET). She also had skin lesions that were proven to be reactive perforating collagenosis and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. She was managed conservatively and received interferon injections with fair general condition and control of her ET. However, her kidney function deteriorated furthermore to stage V chronic kidney disease requiring regular treatment with hemodialysis.

The encoded proteins for C. albicans, CaSln1p and CaNik1p, which are similar to Sln1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nik-1 from Neurospora crassa, seem to function in osmoregulation and morphogenesis, respectively. Recently, the isolation of CaHK1, a putative histidine kinase gene from C. albicans has been reported. In addition to the histidine and aspartyl domains located at its C-terminus as previously described, it is shown here that the N-terminal domain of Cahk1p contains a P-loop motif and a sequence which shows significant homology with the seven C-terminal domains of serine/threonine kinases. The Ser/Thr-homologous domains of Cahk1p could, in fact, correspond to its sensor sequence. CaHK1 has been mapped to chromosome 2 and gene deletion studies were undertaken to understand its function. Deltacahk1 mutants are phenotypically different from any other histidine kinase mutants thus far described either in C. albicans or in any other yeast or filamentous fungus. This study demonstrates that deltacahk1 mutants flocculate extensively in a gene-dosage-dependent manner under conditions which induce germ-tube formation, such as growth in medium 199 (pH 7.5). The flocculation occurs by an interaction along the hyphal surfaces, probably because of the altered expression of one or more hyphal-cell-surface components in the deltacahk1 mutants. These results indicate that CaHK1 could be involved in regulating their expression."

Regulatory mechanisms often involve more than one transcription factor (TF) from different families, binding together and attaching to the DNA as a single complex. However, only a fraction of the regulatory partners of each TF is currently known. In this paper, we present the Transcriptional Interaction and Coregulation Analyzer (TICA), a novel methodology for predicting heterotypic physical interaction of TFs. TICA employs a data-driven approach to infer interaction phenomena from chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Its prediction rules are based on the distribution of minimal distance couples of paired binding sites belonging to different TFs which are located closest to each other in promoter regions. Notably, TICA uses only binding site information from input ChIP-seq experiments, bypassing the need to do motif calling on sequencing data. We present our method and test it on ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, using three cell lines as reference including HepG2, GM12878, and K562. TICA positive predictions on ENCODE ChIP-seq data are strongly enriched when compared to protein complex (CORUM) and functional interaction (BioGRID) databases. We also compare TICA against both motif/ChIP-seq based methods for physical TF-TF interaction prediction and published literature. Based on our results, TICA offers significant specificity (average 0.902) while maintaining a good recall (average 0.284) with respect to CORUM, providing a novel technique for fast analysis of regulatory effect in cell lines. Furthermore, predictions by TICA are complementary to other methods for TF-TF interaction prediction (in particular, TACO and CENTDIST). Thus, combined application of these prediction tools results in much improved sensitivity in detecting TF-TF interactions compared to TICA alone (sensitivity of 0.526 when combining TICA with TACO and 0.585 when combining with CENTDIST) with little compromise in specificity (specificity 0.760 when combining with TACO and 0.643 with CENTDIST). TICA is publicly available at http://geco.deib.polimi.it/tica/."

Endemic to Africa, outbreaks have been recorded in six African countries since its detection in 1976. Fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola viruses (EBoV), with humans and other mammals serving as accidental hosts. Transmission of EBoV has been reported in various ways, including human to human transmission through close contact with blood and bodily fluids. The virus has an incubation period ranging from two to twenty-one days, followed by a multitude of clinical manifestations such as the sudden onset of high fever, chills and myalgia depicting a flu-like syndrome. It is usually diagnosed based on several clinical symptoms such as the sudden onset of illness, high fevers for less than three weeks, and at least two hemorrhagic symptoms despite no predisposing factors. This generally provides enough evidence for clinicians to consider EHF and begin supportive treatment until the virus is confirmed through laboratory findings. Management of patients involves supportive care such as maintaining fluid along with electrolyte balance, blood pressure and oxygen saturation. This also includes treating complications arising from secondary infections. The main options include: prophylactic strategies, anti-viral therapy for EVD, immunotherapies, vaccines, and ZMapp. Finally, the key to managing EBoV epidemics is to stop the transmission of disease in the most severely affected population, as prevention has become of utmost importance to alleviate the significant physical and economic burden."

Disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction are commonly associated with cardiac disease. The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin directly interacts with a number of essential protein complexes in the mitochondrial membranes including the respiratory chain, mitochondrial metabolite carriers, and proteins critical for mitochondrial morphology. Barth syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by an inherited defect in the biogenesis of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. How cardiolipin deficiency impacts on mitochondrial function and how mitochondrial dysfunction causes cardiomyopathy has been intensively studied in cellular and animal models of Barth syndrome. These findings may also have implications for the molecular mechanisms underlying other inherited disorders associated with defects in cardiolipin, like Sengers syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA)."

Especially in the group of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients being treated with biologics, the risk seems to be steady among regimens with different modes of action (1.6-2.4/100 patients-years). RA patients receiving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are at increased risk during the first year of treatment.

We will - prospectively - include RA patients who develop herpes zoster, while being treated with biologics (anti-TNF, tocilizumab, rituximab, abatacept) and a control group comprised of patients with herpes zoster [RA patients under non-biologic therapies (corticosteroids/csDMARDs) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls). Titers of IgG specific antibodies against VZV glycoprotein gp1 and the percentage and absolute number of VZV-specific activated CD4+ T cells (CD4+CD69+IFN-\u03b3+) at the time of rash onset and during follow-up will be measured by ELISA and flow cytometry respectively.

CDKs are key regulatory enzymes involved in cell proliferation through regulating cell-cycle checkpoints and transcriptional events in response to extracellular and intracellular signals. Not surprisingly, the dysregulation of CDKs is a hallmark of cancers, and inhibition of specific members is considered an attractive target in cancer therapy. In breast cancer (BC), dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, combined with other agents, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (A/MBC), as well as other sub-types of breast cancer. Furthermore, ongoing studies identified more selective CDK inhibitors as promising clinical targets. In this review, we focus on the roles of CDKs in driving cell-cycle progression, cell-cycle checkpoints, and transcriptional regulation, a highlight of dysregulated CDK activation in BC. We also discuss the most relevant CDK inhibitors currently in clinical BC trials, with special emphasis on CDK4/6 inhibitors used for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2-) M/ABC patients, as well as more emerging precise therapeutic strategies, such as combination therapies and microRNA (miRNA) therapy."

Encouraging preclinical results suggest that \u03b23-AR agonists could also improve obesity-related metabolic disease by increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity.METHODSWe treated 14 healthy women of diverse ethnicities (27.5 \u00b1 1.1 years of age, BMI of 25.4 \u00b1 1.2 kg/m2) with 100 mg mirabegron (Myrbetriq extended-release tablet, Astellas Pharma) for 4 weeks in an open-label study. The primary endpoint was the change in BAT metabolic activity as measured by [18F]-2-fluoro-d-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT. Secondary endpoints included resting energy expenditure (REE), plasma metabolites, and glucose and insulin metabolism as assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.RESULTSChronic mirabegron therapy increased BAT metabolic activity. Whole-body REE was higher, without changes in body weight or composition. Additionally, there were elevations in plasma levels of the beneficial lipoprotein biomarkers HDL and ApoA1, as well as total bile acids. Adiponectin, a WAT-derived hormone that has antidiabetic and antiinflammatory capabilities, increased with acute treatment and was 35% higher upon completion of the study. Finally, an intravenous glucose tolerance test revealed higher insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, and insulin secretion.CONCLUSIONThese findings indicate that human BAT metabolic activity can be increased after chronic pharmacological stimulation with mirabegron and support the investigation of \u03b23-AR agonists as a treatment for metabolic disease.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov NCT03049462.FUNDINGThis work was supported by grants from the Intramural Research Program of the NIDDK, NIH (DK075112, DK075116, DK071013, and DK071014)."

Despite recognition as the CB marker protein, coilin is primarily nucleoplasmic, and the function of this fraction is not fully characterized. Here we show that coilin binds double stranded DNA and has RNase activity in vitro. U1 and U2 snRNAs undergo a processing event of the primary transcript prior to incorporation in the snRNP. We find that coilin displays RNase activity within the CU region of the U2 snRNA primary transcript in vitro, and that coilin knockdown results in accumulation of the 3' pre-processed U1 and U2 snRNA. These findings present new characteristics of coilin in vitro, and suggest additional functions of the protein in vivo."

Lyst-mutant mice exhibit neurologic phenotypes that are sensitive to genetic background. On the DBA/2J-, but not on the C57BL/6J-background, Lyst-mutant mice exhibit overt tremor phenotypes associated with loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we tested whether assays for ataxia could measure this observed strain-dependency, and if so, establish parameters for empowering phenotype- and candidate-driven approaches to identify genetic modifier(s). A composite phenotypic scoring system distinguished phenotypes in Lyst-mutants and uncovered a previously unrecognized background difference between wild-type C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Accelerating rotarod performance also distinguished phenotypes in Lyst-mutants, but at more advanced ages. These results establish that genetic background, Lyst genotype, and age significantly influence the severity of CHS-associated neurologic deficits. Purkinje cell quantifications likewise distinguished phenotypes of Lyst-mutant mice, as well as background differences between wild-type C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. To aid identification of potential genetic modifier genes causing these effects, we searched public datasets for cerebellar-expressed genes that are differentially expressed and/or contain potentially detrimental genetic variants. From these approaches, Nos1, Prdx2, Cbln3, Gnb1, Pttg1 were confirmed to be differentially expressed and leading candidates."

So far, the majority of studies have focused on the primary hosts (wheat and barley) of this pathogen, while the relationships between other sources of infection remain unclear. We monitored and sampled test fields over the course of three years and acquired 804 F. graminearum isolates from different sources: primary hosts and other plant species included in the crop rotations, weeds from the test fields, decaying plant residue, soil samples, and crop seeds. Of these isolates, 73.3% had the 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol genotype and 26.7% had the 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol genotype. F. graminearum isolation rates from weeds (> 50%) were much higher than from soil (< 10%) or decaying plant matter (4%). Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers were used for population analysis. Noticeable genetic differentiation was detected between isolates from living plants and soil biome. In contrast, absence of any noticeable division between primary and alternative plant host communities, indicate the importance of weeds and other segetal plants for FHB control and prevention."

The contribution of this hardwiring effect on genome evolution remains obscure. We looked for population genomics signatures of adaptive evolution associated with A-to-I RNA edited sites in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. We found that single nucleotide polymorphisms at edited sites occur 3 (humans) to 15 times (Drosophila) more often than at unedited sites, the nucleotide G is virtually the unique alternative allele at edited sites and G alleles segregate at higher frequency at edited sites than at unedited sites. Our study reveals that a significant fraction of coding synonymous and nonsynonymous as well as silent and intergenic A-to-I RNA editing sites are likely adaptive in the distantly related human and Drosophila lineages."

However, several challenges, including imprecise diagnosis criteria, multiple confounding factors, and unclear and heterogeneous molecular mechanisms, impede effective investigation of preventions and treatments for chemobrain. With the rapid increase in the number of cancer survivors, chemobrain is an urgent but unmet clinical need. Here, we leverage the extensive knowledge in various fields of neuroscience to gain insights into the mechanisms for chemobrain. We start by outlining why the post-mitotic adult brain is particularly vulnerable to chemotherapy. Next, through drawing comparisons with normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury, we identify universal cellular mechanisms that may underlie the cognitive deficits in chemobrain. We further identify existing neurological drugs targeting these cellular mechanisms that can be repurposed as treatments for chemobrain, some of which were already shown to be effective in animal models. Finally, we briefly describe future steps to further advance our understanding of chemobrain and facilitate the development of effective preventions and treatments."

Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, which deplete dopamine at presynaptic striatal nerve terminals, are a class of drugs that have long been used to treat hyperkinetic movement disorders, but have recently gained more attention following their development for specific indications in the United States. At present, there are three commercially available VMAT2 inhibitors: tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine. Pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and dosing vary significantly between the three drugs, and likely underlie the more favorable side effect profile of the newer agents (deutetrabenazine and valbenazine). Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease, including in randomized controlled trials, although direct comparison studies are limited. Both deutetrabenazine and valbenazine have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, with multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, whereas tetrabenazine has been studied less rigorously. There have been no blinded, prospective trials with tetrabenazine in Tourette's syndrome (TS); however, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in TS are ongoing for both deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. Given the favored side effect profile of newer VMAT2 inhibitors, clinicians should be aware of the distinctions between agents and become familiar with differences in their use, especially as there is potential for their utilization to increase across the range of hyperkinetic movement disorders."

Bone formation around the tooth germs starts prenatally and, in the mouse model, the mesenchymal condensation turns into a complex vascularized bone (containing osteo-blasts, -cytes, -clasts) within only two days. This very short but critical period is characterized by synchronized cellular and molecular events. The m/a bone, as others, is subjected to endocrine regulations. This not only requires vasculature to allow the circulation of active molecules (ligands), but also the expression of corresponding cell receptors to define target tissues. This contribution aimed at following the dynamics of calciotropic receptors\u00b4 expression during morphological transformation of a mesenchymal condensation into the initial m/a bone structure. Receptors for all three calciotropic systemic regulators: parathormone, calcitonin and activated vitamin D (calcitriol), were localized on serial histological sections using immunochemistry and their relative expression was quantified by q-PCR. The onset of calciotropic receptors was followed along with bone cell differentiation (as checked using osteocalcin, sclerostin, RANK and TRAP) and vascularization (CD31) during mouse prenatal/embryonic (E) days 13-15 and 18. Additionally, the timing of calciotropic receptor appearance was compared with that of estrogen receptors (ESR1, ESR2). PTH receptor (PTH1r) appeared in the bone already at E13, when the first osteocalcin-positive cells were detected within the mesenchymal condensation forming the bone anlage. At this stage, blood vessels were only lining the condensation. At E14, the osteoblasts started to express the receptor for activated vitamin D (VDR). At this stage, the vasculature just penetrated the forming bone. On the same day, the first TRAP-positive (but not yet multinucleated) osteoclastic cells were identified. However, calcitonin receptor was detected only one day later. The first Sost-positive osteocytes, present at E15, were PTH1r and VDR positive. ESR1 almost copied the expression pattern of PTH1r, and ESR2 appearance was similar with VDR with a significant increase between E15 and E18. This report focuses on the in vivo situation and links morphological transformation of the mesenchymal cell condensation into a bone structure with dynamics of cell differentiation/maturation, vascularization and onset of receptors for calciotropic endocrine signalling in developing m/a bone."

The biology of adipose tissue in an obese individual is abnormally altered in a manner that increases the body's vulnerability to immune diseases, such as psoriasis. Psoriasis is considered a chronic inflammatory skin disease which is closely associated with being overweight and obese. Additionally, secretion of leptin, a type of adipokine, increases dependently on adipose cell size and adipose accumulation. Likewise, high leptin levels also aggravate obesity via development of leptin resistance, suggesting that leptin and obesity are closely related. Leptin induction in psoriatic patients is mainly driven by the interleukin (IL)-23/helper T (Th) 17 axis pathway. Furthermore, leptin can have an effect on various types of immune cells such as T cells and dendritic cells. Here, we discuss the relationship between obesity and leptin expression as well as the linkage between effect of leptin on immune cells and psoriasis progression."

We compared the effects of the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, ixazomib and carfilzomib and the ubiquitin E1 enzyme inhibitor MLN7243/TAK-243 on cell viability and cell death in normal keratinocytes and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cell lines. The effects of both a pulse of treatment and more extended incubation were investigated. This is relevant to directly-delivered therapy (topical treatment/intratumoral injection) where the time of exposure can be controlled and a short exposure may better reflect systemically-delivered inhibitor pharmacokinetics. These agents can selectively kill cSCC cells but there are variations in the pattern of cSCC cell line sensitivity/resistance. Variations in the responses to proteasome inhibitors are associated with differences in the specificity of the inhibitors for the three proteolytic activities of the proteasome. There is greater selectivity for killing cSCC cells compared to normal keratinocytes with a pulse of proteasome inhibitor treatment than with a more extended exposure. We provide evidence that c-MYC-dependent NOXA upregulation confers susceptibility to a short incubation with proteasome inhibitors by priming cSCC cells for rapid BAK-dependent death. We observed that bortezomib-resistant cSCC cells can be sensitive to MLN7243-induced death. Low expression of the ubiquitin E1 UBA1/UBE1 participates in conferring susceptibility to MLN7243 by increasing sensitivity to MLN7243-mediated attenuation of ubiquitination. This study supports further investigation of the potential of proteasome and ubiquitin E1 inhibition for cSCC therapy. Direct delivery of inhibitors could facilitate adequate exposure of skin cancers."

After a new genome is sequenced and assembled, structural gene annotation is often the first step in analysis. Despite advances in computational gene prediction algorithms, most eukaryotic genomes still benefit from manual gene annotation. This requires access to good genome browsers to enable annotators to visualize and evaluate multiple lines of evidence (e.g., sequence similarity, RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq] results, gene predictions, repeats) and necessitates many volunteers to participate in the work. To address the technical barriers to creating genome browsers, the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://gep.wustl.edu/) has partnered with the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org) to develop G-OnRamp (http://g-onramp.org), a web-based platform for creating UCSC Genome Browser Assembly Hubs and JBrowse genome browsers. G-OnRamp also converts a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. The genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research. In the process, students learn about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Development of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback. Sixty-five researchers/educators from >40 institutions participated through in-person workshops, which produced >20 genome browsers now available for research and education. Genome browsers generated for four parasitoid wasp species have been used in a CURE engaging students at 15 colleges and universities. Our assessment results in the classroom demonstrate that the genome browsers produced by G-OnRamp are effective tools for engaging undergraduates in research and in enabling their contributions to the scientific literature in genomics. Expansion of such genomics research/education partnerships will be beneficial to researchers, faculty, and students alike."

The ER therefore has a major influence on cellular lipid biomass and balances the production of different lipid categories, classes, and species. Signals from outside and inside the cell are directed to ER-localized enzymes, and lipid enzyme activities are defined by the integration of internal, homeostatic, and external information. This allows ER-localized lipid synthesis to provide the cell with membrane lipids for growth, proliferation, and differentiation-based changes in morphology and structure, and to maintain membrane homeostasis across the cell. ER enzymes also respond to physiological signals to drive carbohydrates and nutritionally derived lipids into energy-storing triglycerides. In this review, we highlight some key regulatory mechanisms that control ER-localized enzyme activities in animal cells. We also discuss how they act in concert to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis, as well as how their dysregulation contributes to human disease."

RNA polymerase III (Pol III) drives the production of tRNAs and other small RNAs essential for the flow of genetic information from gene to protein and we have found that a specific isoform of a subunit unique to Pol III is expressed early in the myogenic lineage. This points to the possibility that additional regulatory networks exist to control the production of Pol III transcripts during skeletal muscle differentiation. We describe the differential expression of Polr3g and its alternate isoform Polr3gL during embryonic development and using a custom tRNA microarray, we demonstrate their distinct activity on the synthesis of tRNA isoacceptors. We show that Pol III dependent transcripts are dramatically down-regulated during the differentiation of skeletal muscle, as are mRNAs coding for Pol III associated proteins Brf1 and Brf2, while Polr3gL is up-regulated alongside contractile protein genes. Forcing Polr3g expression in this context results in a partial reversal of myogenic differentiation."

With the advantage of molecular cloning and fluorescent protein tagging, essential components for microtubule dynamics/stability and function were identified, including activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, ADNP and its peptide snippet, NAP (drug candidate, davunetide/CP201). ADNP/NAP through the SxIP motif interact with microtubule end binding proteins EB1 and EB3 to increase microtubule dynamics, axonal transport and dendritic spine formation. Recent transcriptomic analysis of the young mouse brain at the single cell level enabled characterization of cell-type specific cytoskeleton related gene signatures (e.g., tubulin transcripts, microtubule-associated protein Tau, Mapt and microtubule end binding protein, EB3, Mapre3) at unprecedented detail. Here, we review these findings with a methodological perspective to highlight how cutting-edge techniques have allowed us to disentangle cytoskeleton dynamics in health and disease."

We show that alterations conferring resistance to poisons of human and yeast topoisomerase II derive from a rich mutational 'landscape' of amino acid substitutions broadly distributed throughout the entire enzyme. Both general and discriminatory drug-resistant behaviors are found to arise from different point mutations found at the same amino acid position and to occur far outside known drug-binding sites. Studies of selected resistant enzymes confirm the NGS data and further show that the anti-cancer quinolone vosaroxin acts solely as an intercalating poison, and that the antibacterial ciprofloxacin can poison yeast topoisomerase II. The innate drug-sensitivity of the DNA binding and cleavage region of human and yeast topoisomerases (particularly hTOP2\u03b2) is additionally revealed to be significantly regulated by the enzymes' adenosine triphosphatase regions. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of using NGS-based methods to rapidly map drug resistance landscapes and reveal that the nucleotide turnover elements of type II topoisomerases impact drug specificity."

Overexpression of RNF123 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production triggered by Sendai virus (SeV) and encephalomyocarditis picornavirus (EMCV). Knockdown or knockout of endogenous RNF123 potentiates IFN-\u03b2 production triggered by SeV and EMCV, but not by the sensor of DNA viruses cGAS RNF123 associates with RIG-I and MDA5 in both endogenous and exogenous cases in a viral infection-inducible manner. The SPRY and coiled-coil, but not the RING, domains of RNF123 are required for the inhibitory function. RNF123 interacts with the N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I/MDA5 and competes with the downstream adaptor VISA/MAVS/IPS-1/Cardif for RIG-I/MDA5 CARD binding. These findings suggest that RNF123 functions as a novel inhibitor of innate antiviral signaling mediated by RIG-I and MDA5, a function that does not depend on its E3 ligase activity."

DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 knockdown increased the apoptosis of basal cell carcinoma cells induced by tunicamycin. Results found that DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 knockdown increased JAK2 and STAT3 expression in basal cell carcinoma cells. JAK2 inhibitor decreased STAT3 expression and abolished the inhibitory effects of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 silencing on migration and invasion in basal cell carcinoma cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 is a potential target for inhibiting basal cell carcinoma cells growth, migration, and invasion by downregulating JAK2/STAT3 pathway."

                    "context": "Efforts to chemically modify nucleic acids got underway merely a decade after the discovery of the DNA double helix and initially targeted nucleosides and nucleotides. The origins of three analogues that remain staples of modification strategies and figure prominently in FDA-approved nucleic acid therapeutics can be traced to the 1960s: 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-RNA (2'-F RNA), 2'- O-methyl-RNA (2'- OMe RNA), and the phosphorothioates (PS-DNA/RNA). Progress in nucleoside phosphoramidite-based solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis has gone hand in hand with the creation of second-generation (e.g., 2'- O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA, MOE-RNA) and third-generation (e.g., bicyclic nucleic acids, BNAs) analogues, giving rise to an expanding universe of modified nucleic acids. Thus, beyond site-specifically altered DNAs and RNAs with a modified base, sugar, and/or phosphate backbone moieties, nucleic acid chemists have created a host of conjugated oligonucleotides and artificial genetic polymers (XNAs). The search for oligonucleotides with therapeutic efficacy constitutes a significant driving force for these investigations. However, nanotechnology, diagnostics, synthetic biology and genetics, nucleic acid etiology, and basic research directed at the properties of native and artificial pairing systems have all stimulated the design of ever more diverse modifications. Modification of nucleic acids can affect pairing and chemical stability, conformation and interactions with a flurry of proteins and enzymes that play important roles in uptake, transport or processing of targets. Enhancement of metabolic stability is a central concern in the design of antisense, siRNA and aptamer oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications. In the antisense approach, uniformly modified oligonucleotides or so-called gapmers are used to target a specific RNA. The former may sterically block transcription or direct alternative splicing, whereas the latter feature a central PS window that elicits RNase H-mediated cleavage of the target. The key enzyme in RNA interference (RNAi) is Argonaute 2 (Ago2), a dynamic multidomain enzyme that binds multiple regions of the guide (antisense) and passenger (sense) siRNAs. The complexity of the individual interactions between Ago2 and the siRNA duplex provides significant challenges for chemical modification. Therefore, a uniform (the same modification throughout, e.g., antisense) or nearly uniform (e.g., aptamer) modification strategy is less useful in the pursuit of siRNA therapeutic leads. Instead, unique structural features and protein interactions of 5'-end (guide/Ago2MID domain), seed region, central region (cleavage site/Ago2 PIWI domain), and 3'-terminal nucleotides (guide/Ago2 PAZ domain) demand a more nuanced approach in the design of chemically modified siRNAs for therapeutic use. This Account summarizes current siRNA modification strategies with an emphasis on the regio-specific interactions between oligonucleotide and Ago2 and how these affect the choice of modification and optimization of siRNA efficacy. In addition to standard assays applied to measure the effects of modification on the stability of pairing and resistance against nuclease degradation, structural insights based on crystallographic data for modified RNAs alone and in complex with Ago2 from molecular modeling studies are a valuable guide in the design of siRNA therapeutics. Thus, this comprehensive approach is expected to result in accelerated generation of new siRNA-based therapies against various diseases, now that the first siRNA has obtained approval by the US FDA for treatment of hereditary hATTR amyloidosis."

AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of AD individuals accompanied by global neuronal loss. The peptide amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregates to amyloid plaques in AD brains. As a result, many therapeutic approaches target A\u03b2. Human plasma and the plasma product intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contain naturally-occurring anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (Nabs-A\u03b2) that appear to reduce risks of developing AD. IVIG sequesters A\u03b2 and thus interferes with AD progression. This study reviews the role of different A\u03b2 species, Nabs-A\u03b2, preclinical data, and clinical studies of IVIG as potential AD treatments. The focus of this study is the outcomes of a recent Gammaglobulin Alzheimer's Partnership Phase III trial that did not reach primary endpoints, as well as efforts to compare IVIG with current anti-A\u03b2 monoclonals such as bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and BIIB037. Moreover, this study critically examines current market and ethical consequences of potential off-label uses of IVIG, limits in IVIG supply, and subsequent challenges."

Mechanistically, cohesin is proposed to extrude chromatin loops bidirectionally until it encounters occupied CTCF DNA-binding sites. Curiously, loops form predominantly between CTCF binding sites in a convergent orientation. How CTCF interacts with and blocks cohesin extrusion in an orientation-specific manner has remained a mechanistic mystery. Here, we review recent papers that have shed light on these processes and suggest a multi-step interaction between CTCF and cohesin. This interaction may first involve a pausing step, where CTCF halts cohesin extrusion, followed by a stabilization step of the CTCF-cohesin complex, resulting in a chromatin loop. Finally, we discuss our own recent studies on an internal RNA-Binding Region (RBRi) in CTCF to elucidate its role in regulating CTCF clustering, target search mechanisms and chromatin loop formation and future challenges."

The fatal outcome is predominantly due to renal failure and/or cardiac dysfunction. Because amyloid fibrils formed by all amyloidogenic proteins share structural similarity, amyloidoses may be studied in transgenic models expressing any amyloidogenic protein. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing an amyloidogenic variant of human apolipoprotein AII, a major protein of high density lipoprotein. According to amyloid nomenclature this variant was termed STOP78SERApoAII. STOP78SER-APOA2 expression at the physiological level spontaneously induced systemic amyloidosis in all mice with full-length mature STOP78SER-ApoAII identified as the amyloidogenic protein. Amyloid deposits stained with Congo red were extracellular, and consisted of fibrils of approximately 10 nm diameter. Renal glomerular amyloidosis was a major feature with onset of renal insufficiency occurring in mice older than six months of age. The liver, heart and spleen were also greatly affected. Expression of STOP78SER-APOA2 in the liver and intestine in mice of the K line but not in other amyloid-laden organs showed they present systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid burden was a function of STOP78SER-APOA2 expression and age of the mice with amyloid deposition starting in two-month-old high-expressing mice that died from six months onwards. Because STOP78SER-ApoAII conserved adequate lipid binding capacity as shown by high STOP78SER-ApoAII amounts in high density lipoprotein of young mice, its decrease in circulation with age suggests preferential deposition into preformed fibrils. Thus, our mouse model faithfully reproduces early-onset hereditary systemic amyloidosis and is ideally suited to devise and test novel therapies."

Despite the potential of siRNA therapies, there are hurdles limiting their clinical application such as poor transport across biological barriers, limited cellular uptake, degradation, and rapid clearance. Nanotechnology can address these challenges. In fact, the past few decades have seen the conceptualization, design, pre-clinical testing and recent clinical approval of a RNAi nanodrug to treat disease. In this review, we comment on the current state of play of clinical trials evaluating siRNA nanodrugs and review pre-clinical studies investigating the efficacy of siRNA therapeutics in pancreatic cancer. We assess the physiological barriers unique to pancreatic cancer that need to be considered when designing and testing new nanomedicines for this disease."

The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length."

Understanding the signaling pathways activated by D2R is crucial to finding new therapeutic targets for these disorders. D2R stimulation by its agonist, dopamine, causes desensitization and internalization of the receptor. A previous study found that inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) blocked D2R desensitization in neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the brain. In the present study, using a cell-based system, we investigated whether ALK regulates D2R internalization. The ALK inhibitor alectinib completely inhibited dopamine-induced D2R internalization. Since GPCRs can transactivate receptor tyrosine kinases, we also examined if D2R stimulation activated ALK signaling. ALK phosphorylation increased by almost 2-fold after dopamine treatment and ALK coimmunoprecipitated with D2R. To identify the signaling pathways downstream of ALK that might regulate D2R internalization, we used pharmacological inhibitors of proteins activated by ALK signaling. Protein kinase C"

Embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from pluripotent stem cells have been a popular model to study the differentiation of the main three germ layers and to define regulatory circuits during cell fate specification. Although it is well-known that tissue-specific enhancers play an important role in these networks by interacting with promoters, assigning them to their relevant target genes still remains challenging. To make this possible, quantitative approaches are needed to study enhancer-promoter contacts and their dynamics during development. Here, we adapted a 4C method to define enhancers and their contacts with cognate promoters in the EB differentiation model. The method uses frequently cutting restriction enzymes, sonication, and a nested-ligation-mediated PCR protocol compatible with commercial DNA library preparation kits. Subsequently, the 4C libraries are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and analyzed bioinformatically, allowing detection and quantification of all sequences that have contacts with a chosen promoter. The resulting sequencing data can also be used to gain information about the dynamics of enhancer-promoter contacts during differentiation. The technique described for the EB differentiation model is easy to implement."

Therefore, there is a need to better understand the role of ALK in cancer biology in order to optimise treatment strategies. This review summarises the latest research on the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, and how this information can guide the management of patients with cancer that is ALK-positive. A variety of ALK gene alterations have been described across a range of tumour types, including point mutations, deletions and rearrangements. A wide variety of ALK fusions, in which the kinase domain of ALK and the amino-terminal portion of various protein partners are fused, occur in cancer, with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK being the most prevalent in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Different ALK fusion proteins can mediate different signalling outputs, depending on properties such as subcellular localisation and protein stability. The ALK fusions found in tumours lack spatial and temporal regulation, which can also affect dimerisation and substrate specificity. Two ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib and ceritinib, are currently approved in Europe for use in ALK-positive NSCLC and several others are in development. These ALK TKIs bind slightly differently within the ATP-binding pocket of the ALK kinase domain and are associated with the emergence of different resistance mutation patterns during therapy. This emphasises the need to tailor the sequence of ALK TKIs according to the ALK signature of each patient. Research into the oncogenic functions of ALK, and fast paced development of ALK inhibitors, has substantially improved outcomes for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Limited data are available surrounding the physiological ligand-stimulated activation of ALK signalling and further research is needed. Understanding the role of ALK in tumour biology is key to further optimising therapeutic strategies for ALK-positive disease."

Neurons in these hemilineages use one of the three fast-acting neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, or glutamate) for communication. We generated a comprehensive neurotransmitter usage map for the entire ventral nerve cord. We did not find any cases of neurons using more than one neurotransmitter, but found that the acetylcholine specific gene ChAT is transcribed in many glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but these transcripts typically do not leave the nucleus and are not translated. Importantly, our work uncovered a simple rule: All neurons within a hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter. Thus, neurotransmitter identity is acquired at the stem cell level. Our detailed transmitter- usage/lineage identity map will be a great resource for studying the developmental basis of behavior and deciphering how neuronal circuits function to regulate behavior."

Overcontrol underlies a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses and as such, an innovative transdiagnostic therapy called Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT) has been developed to treat disorders characterized by overcontrol. RO DBT targets maladaptive social signaling in order to help individuals \"rejoin the tribe,\" hypothesizing that increasing social connectedness by means of targeting social signaling is the central mechanism of change in treatment. Because RO DBT is used for individuals with an overcontrolled personality style, rather than individual disordered symptoms, it can be used transdiagnostically across a range of comorbid disorders, including treatment-resistant depression and anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and personality disorders such as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. The current article introduces this novel treatment approach and discusses its emphasis on social signaling and its transdiagnostic nature. We then provide the first review of existing literature testing the efficacy of RO DBT across clinical populations, discuss issues related to assessment of overcontrol, and speculate on future directions for this novel therapy."

Methods This was an observational study conducted for eight months (March 2019 to September 2019) at the Orthopedic Department in collaboration with the Radiology Department. Clinically diagnosed RSI patients from both genders, aged between 30 and 50 years, were included in the study. Clinical features that were considered include pain, swelling, and site of injury. Radiological findings from ultrasound, X-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were identified in all participants of the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were represented as frequency and percentages. Results There were a total of 82 patients (40 males,42 females) with repetitive stress injury (RSI), with a mean age of 42.63\u00b18.53 years. Of the 82 patients, 34 (41.4%) had DQ disease, 28 (34.1%) had TE, and 20 (24.4%) had PF. Pain and swelling were observed in all patients. In TE, the most affected site was the right lateral epicondyle process. The common radiological findings were hypoechoic fascia, increased fluid within the first extensor tendon compartment, cortical erosion, sclerosis in soft tissues, and calcification in soft tissues. Cozen's test was positive in most patients. In DQ, the most affected sites were left and right radial styloid processes. The common radiological findings were hypoechoic fascia, increased fluid within the first extensor, cortical erosion, and periosteal reaction. Finkelstein's test was also positive in most patients. In PT, the most affected site was the left heal plantar surface. The common radiological findings were hypoechoic fascia, increased thickness of fascia (>4.5 mm), increased fluid within the first extensor tendon compartment, cortical erosion, sclerosis in soft tissues, calcaneal spur, periosteal reaction, and calcification in soft tissues. Cozen's and Finkelstein's tests were also positive in most patients. Conclusions History, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging modalities all are important tools for the differential diagnosis of RSI. Our study results showed that if some clinical findings fail to diagnose any RSI, then ultrasound, X-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the best and useful options before treatment."

We sought to quantify bone degradation by comparing urinary concentrations of carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), a well-described marker of bone resorption, in a prospective cohort of 52 adults with sickle cell disease enrolled in the Sickle Cell Pain Markers Study. We also questioned if changes in urinary CTX-1 concentrations correlated with changes in hemolysis and inflammatory markers measured both during and after resolution of a painful vaso-occlusive episode. Thirty-one of the 52 adults enrolled in the study had paired urine samples for CTX-1 analysis. Urinary CTX-1, corrected for urine creatinine, significantly decreased from a mean of 3.45\u202f\u03bcg/mmol during vaso-occlusive crises to 2.62\u202f\u03bcg/mmol at recovery (p\u202f=\u202f0.01). Thus, increased bone loss appears to correlate with acute vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. Our finding that urinary CTX-1 can be used to probe bone degradation in sickle cell disease provides an important new tool for diagnosing and monitoring response to therapy for people with sickle cell-related bone loss."

Small molecule inhibitors of BACE1 are being tested in clinical trials for AD, but the safety and efficacy of BACE1 inhibition has yet to be fully explored. Knockout of the Bace1 gene in the germline of mice causes multiple neurological phenotypes, suggesting that BACE1 inhibition could be toxic. However, these phenotypes could be the result of BACE1 deficiency during development rather than due to the lack of BACE1 function in the adult. To address this problem, we generated tamoxifen-inducible conditional BACE1 knockout mice in which the Bace1 gene may be deleted in the whole body of the adult at will. Importantly, the adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice largely lack phenotypes, indicating that many BACE1 functions are not required in the adult organism. However, a germline phenotype was observed after BACE1 knockout in the adult: reduced length and disorganization of the hippocampal mossy fiber infrapyramidal bundle comprised of axons of dentate gyrus granule cells. The infrapyramidal bundle abnormality correlated with reduced proteolytic processing of the neural cell adhesion protein CHL1 that is involved in axonal guidance. We conclude that BACE1 inhibition in the adult mouse brain does not lead to the phenotypes associated with BACE1 deficiency during embryonic and postnatal development. However, adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice also suggest that BACE1 inhibitor drugs may disrupt the organization of an axonal pathway in the hippocampus, an important structure for learning and memory. Here, I review the adult conditional BACE1 knockout results and consider their implications for BACE1 inhibitor clinical trials."

Therefore, close attention is required with this type of injury. The limb can be saved though early detection and immediate reconstruction of the injured artery, followed by fasciotomy. We report here a rare case of popliteal artery occlusion proximal to the surgical zone, which was diagnosed after fixation of a medial tibial plateau fracture and posterior cruciate avulsion injury. In dashboard injuries without knee dislocation, the arterial intima may be injured and become vulnerable, even with an initial ankle brachial index greater than 0.9. This can cause concomitant occlusion of the popliteal artery due to iatrogenic retraction during surgery. Therefore, a neurovascular examination should be repeated to prevent delayed-onset thrombosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of popliteal artery injury concomitant with a tibial plateau fracture and PCL avulsion owing to initial dashboard injury-related arterial intima injury, which can present with a normal ankle brachial index."

Sixty-two healthy dogs and 15 dogs with pyometra that underwent standardized OHE were included.

Serum P4 was measured 30 minutes pre-op and 6 and 24 hours post-op. Healthy dogs were classified in 3 groups based on their initial P4 concentration and in 3 separate groups based on their oestrus cycle stage. The temperature differentiation between the groups of the study was assessed using the repeated measures mixed-design ANOVA analysis. Temperature measured 18-42 hours post-op was significantly decreased compared to pre-op when initial P4 >8 ng/mL but not significantly decreased when P4 <8 ng/mL. Post-op temperature fluctuation in pregnant dogs showed no significant difference compared to dogs in diestrus. Dogs with pyometra had significantly lower temperature 6-48 hours post-op compared to all other groups. Conclusively, mild hypothermia (37.5-37.9\u00b0C) may be anticipated 18-42 hours after OHE performed in early diestrus or pregnancy in healthy dogs. More significant hypothermia (37.1-37.5\u00b0C) may be anticipated in normally recovering pyometra cases."

In the SSRs,the mono-nucleotide was the most abundant repeat motif(42. 5%),followed by tri-nucleotide(34. 48%),C/G and CCG/CGG were the dominant repeat motifs,respectively. The number of repetitions of the six SSR repeat types was concentrated on 5 to 12 times,and the length was mostly less than 24 bp. A total of 12 282 pairs of primers were screened and selected 20 pairs of primers for validity detection randomly,10 pairs of primers amplified the expected specific bands,and primer P1 has significant polymorphism. Moreover,it was found that unigene containing SSR loci is mainly related to genetic and environmental functions after GO and KEGG annotation. In conclusion,these SSR loci in the transcriptome of O. sinensis are high in frequency,rich in primitive types,high in polymorphism,and highly available,which will provides abundant candidate molecular markers for its genetic diversity analysis,resource identification protection,and gene function research."

                    "context": "Loss of bone and muscle mass are two major clinical complications among the growing list of chronic diseases that primarily affect elderly individuals. Persistent low-grade inflammation, one of the major drivers of aging, is also associated with both bone and muscle dysfunction in aging. Particularly, chronic activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and elevated levels of its ligands high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), AGEs, S100 proteins and A\u03b2 fibrils have been linked to bone and muscle loss in various pathologies. Further, genetic or pharmacologic RAGE inhibition has been shown to preserve both bone and muscle mass. However, whether short-term pharmacologic RAGE inhibition can prevent early bone and muscle loss in aging is unknown. To address this question, we treated young (4-mo) and middle-aged (15-mo) C57BL/6 female mice with vehicle or Azeliragon, a small-molecule RAGE inhibitor initially developed to treat Alzheimer's disease. Azeliragon did not prevent the aging-induced alterations in bone geometry or mechanics, likely due to its differential effects [direct vs. indirect] on bone cell viability/function. On the other hand, Azeliragon attenuated the aging-related body composition changes [fat and lean mass] and reversed the skeletal muscle alterations induced with aging. Interestingly, while Azeliragon induced similar metabolic changes in bone and skeletal muscle, aging differentially altered the expression of genes associated with glucose uptake/metabolism in these two tissues, highlighting a potential explanation for the differential effects of Azeliragon on bone and skeletal muscle in middle-aged mice. Overall, our findings suggest that while short-term pharmacologic RAGE inhibition did not protect against early aging-induced bone alterations, it prevented against the early effects of aging in skeletal muscle."

Although used for distinguishing bacterial species, its use remains limited due to the presence of variable copy numbers with sequence variation in the genomes. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequences, obtained from completely assembled whole genome and Sanger electrophoresis sequencing of cloned PCR products from Serratia fonticola GS2, were compared. Sanger sequencing produced a combination of sequences from multiple copies of 16S rRNA genes. To determine whether the variant copies of 16S rRNA genes affected Sanger sequencing, two ratios (5:5 and 8:2) with different concentrations of cloned 16S rRNA genes were used; it was observed that the greater the number of copies with similar sequences the higher its chance of amplification. Effect of multiple copies for taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA gene sequences was investigated using the strain GS2 as a model. 16S rRNA copies with the maximum variation had 99.42% minimum pairwise similarity and this did not have an effect on species identification. Thus, PCR products from genomes containing variable 16S rRNA gene copies can provide sufficient information for species identification except from species which have high similarity of sequences in their 16S rRNA gene copies like the case of Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus. In silico analysis of 1,616 bacterial genomes from long-read sequencing was also done. The average minimum pairwise similarity for each phylum was reported with their average genome size and average \"unique copies\" of 16S rRNA genes and we found that the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes showed the highest amount of variation in their copies of their 16S rRNA genes. Overall, our results shed light on how the variations in the multiple copies of the 16S rRNA genes of bacteria can aid in appropriate species identification."

Current treatment of the disease, essentially symptomatic, is based on three cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, affecting the glutamatergic system. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for treatment of AD. This article presents current directions in the search for novel, potentially effective agents for the treatment of AD, as well as selected promising treatment strategies. These include agents acting upon the beta-amyloid, such as vaccines, antibodies and inhibitors or modulators of \u03b3- and \u03b2-secretase; agents directed against the tau protein as well as compounds acting as antagonists of neurotransmitter systems (serotoninergic 5-HT6 and histaminergic H3). Ongoing clinical trials with A\u03b2 antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab) seem to be promising, while vaccines against the tau protein (AADvac1 and ACI-35) are now in early-stage trials. Interesting results have also been achieved in trials involving small molecules such as inhibitors of \u03b2-secretase (MK-8931, E2609), a combination of 5-HT6 antagonist (idalopirdine) with donepezil, inhibition of advanced glycation end product receptors by azeliragon or modulation of the acetylcholine response of \u03b1-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by encenicline. Development of new effective drugs acting upon the central nervous system is usually a difficult and time-consuming process, and in the case of AD to-date clinical trials have had a very high failure rate. Most phase II clinical trials ending with a positive outcome do not succeed in phase III, often due to serious adverse effects or lack of therapeutic efficacy."

Entropy is a measure of uncertainty in the set of information. In this study, for each gene and its exons sets, the entropy was calculated in orders one to four. Based on the relative entropy of genes and exons, Kullback-Leibler divergence was calculated. After obtaining the Kullback-Leibler distance for genes and exons sets, the results were entered as input into 7 clustering algorithms: single, complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, and K-means. To aggregate the results of clustering, the AdaBoost algorithm was used. Finally, the results of the AdaBoost algorithm were investigated by GeneMANIA prediction server to explore the results from gene annotation point of view. All calculations were performed using the MATLAB Engineering Software (2015). Following our findings on investigating the results of genes metabolic pathways based on the gene annotations, it was revealed that our proposed clustering method yielded correct, logical, and fast results. This method at the same that had not had the disadvantages of aligning allowed the genes with actual length and content to be considered and also did not require high memory for large-length sequences. We believe that the performance of the proposed method could be used with other competitive gene clustering methods to group biologically relevant set of genes. Also, the proposed method can be seen as a predictive method for those genes bearing up weak genomic annotations."

However, the upstream regulator(s) of 53BP1 function in DNA repair remain unknown. We and others recently reported that TIRR associates with 53BP1 to stabilize it and prevents 53BP1 localization to DNA damage sites by blocking 53BP1 Tudor domain binding to H4K20me2 sites. Here, we report that the Nudix hydrolase NUDT16, a TIRR homolog, regulates 53BP1 stability. We identified a novel post-translational modification of 53BP1 by ADP-ribosylation that is targeted by a PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, leading to 53BP1 polyubiquitination and degradation. In response to DNA damage, ADP-ribosylated 53BP1 increased significantly, resulting in its ubiquitination and degradation. These data suggest that NUDT16 plays a major role in controlling 53BP1 levels under both normal growth conditions and during DNA damage. Notably, overexpression of a NUDT16 catalytically inactive mutant blocked 53BP1 localization to double-strand breaks because: 1) the mutant binding to TIRR increased after IR; 2) the mutant enhanced 53BP1 Tudor domain binding to TIRR, and 3) the mutant impaired the interaction of 53BP1 Tudor domain with H4K20me2. Moreover, NUDT16's catalytic hydrolase activity was required for 53BP1 de-ADP-ribosylation, 53BP1 protein stability, and its function in cell survival. In summary, we demonstrate that NUDT16 regulates 53BP1 stability and 53BP1 recruitment at double-strand breaks, providing yet another mechanism of 53BP1 regulation."

In a retrospective study of 386 cases of GBM collected between 2013 and 2016, we found that recurrence of GBM mainly occurs in the deep brain regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, and corpus callosum. But the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear. Previous studies suggest that neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) is necessary for GBM growth. Our results show that the levels of NLGN3 in the cortex are higher than those in the deep regions in a normal human brain, and similar patterns are also found in a normal mouse brain. In contrast, NLGN3 levels in the deep brain regions of GBM patients are high. We also show that an increase in NLGN3 concentration promotes the growth of U251 cells and U87-MG cells. Respective use of the cortex neuron culture medium (C-NCM) and basal ganglia neuron culture medium (BG-NCM) with DMEM to cultivate U251, U87-MG and GBM cells isolated from patients, we found that these cells grew faster after treatment with C-NCM and BG-NCM in which the cells treated with C-NCM grew faster than the ones treated with BG-NCM group. Inhibition of NLGN3 release by ADAM10i prevents NCM-induced cell growth. Together, this study suggests that increased levels of NLGN3 in the deep brain region under the GBM pathological circumstances may contribute to GBM recurrence in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and corpus callosum."

Wnt signaling plays a role in endothelial dysfunction, in the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and intimal thickening. Moreover, it interferes with inflammation processes, monocyte adhesion and migration, as well as with foam cell formation and vascular calcification progression. Sclerostin is a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and, accordingly, the consequence of increased sclerostin availability can be disruption of the Wnt signalling cascade. Sclerostin is becoming a marker for clinical and subclinical vascular diseases and several lines of evidence illustrate its role in the pathophysiology of the vascular system. Sclerostin levels increase with aging and persist higher in some diseases (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease) that are known to precipitate atherosclerosis and enhance cardiovascular risk. Current knowledge on the association between sclerostin and vascular diseases is summarized in this review."

This is the first oral regimen for gHAT that is effective in treating both disease stages. Although fexinidazole has potential to simplify current therapies, it does not entirely eliminate the need for disease staging by lumbar puncture because patients with severe stage 2 disease (CSF WBC [cerebrospinal fluid white blood cells] greater than 100 cells/\u00b5L) should only be treated with fexinidazole if no other suitable treatment is available. Nausea and vomiting are a common side effect and the drug must be administered during or after the patient's main meal under direct observation by trained health personnel. Due to late relapses, the EMA recommends follow-up to 24 months after treatment."

The circadian clock evolved as an autonomous timekeeping system that aligns behavioural patterns with the solar day and supports the body functions by anticipating and coordinating the required metabolic programmes. The key component of this synchronization is a master clock in the brain, which responds to light-darkness cues from the environment. However, to achieve circadian control of\u00a0the entire organism, each cell of the body is equipped with its own circadian oscillator that is\u00a0controlled by the master clock and confers rhythmicity to individual cells and organs through the control of rate-limiting steps of metabolic programmes. Importantly, metabolic regulation is not a mere output function of the circadian system, but nutrient, energy and redox levels signal back to cellular clocks in order to reinforce circadian rhythmicity and to adapt physiology to temporal tissue-specific needs. Thus, multiple systemic and molecular mechanisms exist that connect the circadian clock with metabolism at all levels, from cellular organelles to the whole organism, and deregulation of this circadian-metabolic crosstalk can lead to various pathologies."

In the present analysis, data from previous skin permeation studies that used the symmetric/equilibrium configuration and skin parallel pathway model were summarized to determine the relationship between enhancement factor and enhancer concentration. Under the equilibrium conditions, semilogarithmic linear relationships between enhancement factor (E) and enhancer aqueous concentration (C) were observed and an enhancer potency parameter (\u03b1) was defined. A correlation between the potency parameter \u03b1 and enhancer octanol/water partition coefficient (Koct) was obtained. The enhancement factor relationship was derived: Log E\u00a0= 0.32 \u2219 C \u2219 Koct. The results suggest that a \"threshold\" of (C \u2219 Koct) > 0.5 M is required to induce effective skin permeation enhancement under these conditions.

While several studies have examined the correlations between these methods and the medial longitudinal arch, very few studies have investigated the same for transverse arches. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between radiographic morphometry and body surface somatometry at medial longitudinal and transverse arches. [Participants and Methods] Fifty healthy adults were included in the study. Six medial longitudinal and three transverse arch evaluation methods were evaluated for the correlation, including the foot posture index. [Results] A correlation was found between the evaluation methods for the medial longitudinal arch, except the lateral talocalcaneal angle; however, no correlation was found between the navicular-metatarsal angle and transverse arch-length ratio in transverse arch evaluation. Additionally, there was no correlation between the evaluation methods for the medial longitudinal and transverse arches. The foot posture index was particularly correlated with radiographic medial longitudinal arch evaluation methods. [Conclusion] During evaluation with radiographic morphometry, it is difficult to set bone markers and differences in tarsal bone arrangement affect the relationship between them; in body surface somatometry, there were differences in measurement at sites with excessive soft tissue. Elucidating the cause for the lack of correlation between the medial longitudinal and transverse arches requires further investigation."

Long noncoding RNAs\u00a0(lncRNAs) have been reported to serve crucial physiological roles in various cardiac diseases. However, the genome\u2011wide expression profile of lncRNAs remains to be elucidated in DCM. In the present study, a case\u2011control study was performed to identify expression deviations in circulating lncRNAs between patients with DCM and controls by RNA sequencing. Partial dysregulated lncRNAs were validated by reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, and lncRNA\u2011messenger RNA (mRNA) co\u2011expression network analyses were employed to probe potential functions of these dysregulated lncRNAs in DCM. Comparison between 8 DCM and 8\u00a0control samples demonstrated that there were alterations in the expression levels of 988\u00a0lncRNAs and 1,418\u00a0mRNAs in total. The dysregulated lncRNAs were found to be mainly associated with system development, organ morphogenesis and metabolic regulation in terms of 'biological processes'. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the gap junction pathway, phagosome, and dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathways may serve crucial roles in the development of DCM. The lncRNA\u2011mRNA co\u2011expression network also suggested that the target genes of the lncRNAs were different in patients with DCM as compared with those in the controls. In conclusion, the present study revealed the genome\u2011wide profile of circulating lncRNAs in DCM by RNA sequencing, and explored the potential functions of these lncRNAs in DCM using bioinformatics analysis. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of lncRNAs in DCM."

MC1R only explains 73% of the SNP heritability for red hair in UK Biobank, and in fact most individuals with two MC1R variants have blonde or light brown hair. We identify other genes contributing to red hair, the combined effect of which accounts for ~90% of the SNP heritability. Blonde hair is associated with over 200 genetic variants and we find a continuum from black through dark and light brown to blonde and account for 73% of the SNP heritability of blonde hair.

During cold exposure, there is obligatory thermogenesis derived from body metabolism as well as adaptive thermogenesis through shivering and non-shivering mechanisms. The latter mainly occurs in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and muscle; however, white adipose tissue (WAT) also can undergo browning via adrenergic stimulation to acquire thermogenic potential. Thyroid hormone (TH) also exerts profound effects on thermoregulation, as decreased body temperature and increased body temperature occur during hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively. We have termed the TH-mediated thermogenesis under thermoneutral conditions \"activated\" thermogenesis. TH acts on the brown and/or white adipose tissues to induce uncoupled respiration through the induction of the uncoupling protein (Ucp1) to generate heat. TH acts centrally to activate the BAT and browning through the sympathetic nervous system. However, recent studies also show that TH acts peripherally on the BAT to directly stimulate Ucp1 expression and thermogenesis through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Additionally, THs can exert Ucp1-independent effects on thermogenesis, most likely through activation of exothermic metabolic pathways. This review summarizes thermogenic effects of THs on adipose tissues."

To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.

We recently discovered that there are two different BG-1 cell lines being used for experiments, denoted here as BG-1 FR and BG-1 NIEHS, which exhibit striking morphological differences. The objective of this study was to methodically analyze these two BG-1 variants and compare their characteristics. Short tandem repeat analysis revealed that the DNA profile of BG-1 FR cells was unique, yet the Short tandem repeat pattern of BG-1 NIEHS was identical with that of MCF-7 cells. From a cytogenetic analysis, it became apparent that the BG-1 FR line had the same profile as previously reported, whereas the BG-1 NIEHS and MCF-7 cells share a similar genetic display. A significant number of unique chromosomal translocations were observed between the BG-1 NIEHS and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that acquired genotypic differences resulted in the formation of two lines from a common origin. Although all cell types demonstrated a similar estrogen responsiveness in reporter gene assays, a microarray analysis revealed distinct estrogen-responsive gene expression patterns with surprisingly moderate to low overlap. We conclude that BG-1 FR is the original ovarian cancer cell line, whereas the BG-1 NIEHS is a variant from the MCF-7 cells. These findings provide much needed clarification of the identities and characteristics of key cell line models that are widely used to study estrogen action in female reproductive cancers. "

We studied routinely obtained autopsy liver tissue of four female hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with male donors, using a highly specific conjoint immunohistochemistry in situ hybridization light microscopic technique. Hepatocyte nuclei were identified by cytokeratin (Cam5.2) staining and evaluated for X and Y chromosome content. Over 1.6 million hepatocytes were assessed for rare instances of donor origin, revealing a Y chromosome in 67. Mixed tetraploids (XXXY) and their nuclear truncation products (XXY, XY, Y) were directly demonstrated, with no detection of the male tetraploids (XXYY) that may result from transdifferentiation with subsequent tetraploidization, nor their unique truncation products (XYY, YY), implicating fusion as the mechanism. To determine whether it is the sole mechanism, we modeled the chromosome distribution based on the same probability of detection of each X chromosome, deriving parameters of sensitivity and female tetraploidy by best fit. We then hypothesized that the distribution of Y chromosome-containing cells could be predicted by a similar model. After modification to account for \"clumpy\" Y chromosomes, the observed results were in accord with the predicted results (p\u2009=\u20090.6).

However, the use of warfarin is problematic, particularly in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) include dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa\u00ae), a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae), Apixaban (Eliquis) and Edoxaban (Lixiana\u00ae), which are direct anti-Xa inhibitors. Unlike warfarin, these agents do not interact with dietary constituents and alcohol, have few reported drug interactions, and monitoring of their anticoagulant intensity is not routinely required due to their predictable anticoagulant effects. In this chapter, we discuss clinical and laboratory aspects of NOAC. These agents have been approved for several therapeutic indications based on phase III prospective randomised controlled clinical trials using warfarin at a target INR of 2.5 (i.e. range 2.0-3.0) as the comparator. However these trials may not be directly applicable to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) where prospective clinical studies of NOAC are the way forward."

Timely diagnosis and evaluation can effectively reduce the sequelae of neurological deficit in SEH. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze a subset of clinical data of SEH after anterior cervical spine surgery, and to investigate the risk factors and treatment experience of this serious complication.Neurological deterioration after anterior cervical spine surgery was detected in six patients. Epidural hematoma was confirmed by emergency cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients included five males and one female, with an average age of 56.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.1 years (range 42-76 years). Three patients had a history of drinking and/or smoking. All of the patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) preoperatively, but without anticoagulant drugs or pre-spinal surgery. The coagulation function was normal in all patients. Except for one patient, who had lower blood pressure (BP) during the operation and higher BP after the operation, the other patients had a normal level of BP during the pre-, intra-, and post-operation periods. The average time was 9.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.7\u200ahours (range, 2-19\u200ahours) from the postoperative period to the initial neurological deficit and 6.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.0\u200ahours (range, 1.8-16.7\u200ahours) from the initial deterioration to evacuation. Five patients underwent emergency evacuation, and one patient underwent conservative treatment. Four patients who underwent evacuation and one patient who received conservative treatment achieved neurological function recovery with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade 2.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.9 (range, 2-4 score) score at the last follow-up. One patient with confirmed arterial epidural hemorrhage during the evaluation showed no neurological function recovery at the last follow-up.Wide exposure of the epidural space and BP level during the perioperative period play an important role in the formation of SEH after anterior cervical spine surgery. Arterial epidural hematoma has serious consequences; therefore, early diagnosis and evaluation play an important role in the recovery from paralysis."

Here we used 11 computational tools based on different approaches to predict the damage-associated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the coding region of the human MC1R gene. Among the 92 nsSNPs arranged according to the predictions 62% were classified as damaging in more than five tools. The classification was significantly correlated with the scores of two consensus programs. Alleles associated with the red hair color (RHC) phenotype and with the risk of melanoma were examined. The R variants D84E, R142H, R151C, I155T, R160W and D294H were classified as damaging by the majority of the tools while the r variants V60L, V92M and R163Q have been predicted as neutral in most of the programs The combination of the prediction tools results in 14 nsSNPs indicated as the most damaging mutations in MC1R (L48P, R67W, H70Y, P72L, S83P, R151H, S172I, L206P, T242I, G255R, P256S, C273Y, C289R and R306H); C273Y showed to be highly damaging in SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutPred, PANTHER and PROVEAN scores.

Advances in next-generation sequencing, coupled to de novo paradigms, facilitated discovery of etiological variants in additional genes in speech disorder cohorts. As for other neurodevelopmental syndromes, gene-driven studies show blurring of boundaries between diagnostic categories, with some risk genes shared across speech disorders, intellectual disability and autism. Convergent evidence hints at involvement of regulatory genes co-expressed in early human brain development, suggesting that etiological pathways could be amenable for investigation in emerging neural models such as cerebral organoids."

Despite the significant recent achievements in the treatment of these patients, however, the identification of clinically relevant subclasses of cancers based on the MMR status remains a major challenge. Many investigations have assessed the role of different diagnostic tools, including immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden in both prognostic and therapeutic settings, with heterogenous results. To date, there are no tumor-specific guidelines or companion diagnostic tests for MMR assessment, and this analysis is often performed with locally developed methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-knowledge of MMR alterations in syndromic and sporadic tumors and discuss the available armamentarium for MMR pathologic characterization, from morphology to high-throughput molecular tools."

As well as providing fundamental nutrients to the growing infant, breast milk is a source of commensal bacteria which further enhance infant health by preventing pathogen adhesion and promoting gut colonisation of beneficial microbes. While breast milk was initially considered a sterile fluid and microbes isolated were considered contaminants, it is now widely accepted that breast milk is home to its own unique microbiome. The origins of bacteria in breast milk have been subject to much debate, however, the possibility of an entero-mammary pathway allowing for transfer of microbes from maternal gut to the mammary gland is one potential pathway. Human milk derived strains can be regarded as potential probiotics; therefore, many studies have focused on isolating strains from milk for subsequent use in infant health and nutrition markets. This review aims to discuss mammary gland development in preparation for lactation as well as explore the microbial composition and origins of the human milk microbiota with a focus on probiotic development."

In this study, we propose a fully automatic way to quantify tumor imaging characteristics using deep learning-based segmentation and test whether these characteristics are predictive of tumor genomic subtypes. We used preoperative imaging and genomic data of 110 patients from 5 institutions with lower-grade gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Based on automatic deep learning segmentations, we extracted three features which quantify two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the tumors. Genomic data for the analyzed cohort of patients consisted of previously identified genomic clusters based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion, DNA methylation, gene expression, DNA copy number, and microRNA expression. To analyze the relationship between the imaging features and genomic clusters, we conducted the Fisher exact test for 10 hypotheses for each pair of imaging feature and genomic subtype. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied a Bonferroni correction. P-values lower than 0.005 were considered statistically significant. We found the strongest association between RNASeq clusters and the bounding ellipsoid volume ratio (p\u202f<\u202f0.0002) and between RNASeq clusters and margin fluctuation (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). In addition, we identified associations between bounding ellipsoid volume ratio and all tested molecular subtypes (p\u202f<\u202f0.02) as well as between angular standard deviation and RNASeq cluster (p\u202f<\u202f0.02). In terms of automatic tumor segmentation that was used to generate the quantitative image characteristics, our deep learning algorithm achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 82% which is comparable to human performance."

Spatial organisation of cellular components is facilitated by a complex network of membrane bound organelles. Both the membrane composition and the intra-organellar content of these organelles can be specifically and temporally controlled by imposing gates, much like bouncers controlling entry into night-clubs. In addition, a new level of compartmentalisation has recently emerged as a fundamental principle of cellular organisation, the formation of membrane-less organelles. Many of these structures are dynamic, rapidly condensing or dissolving and are therefore ideally suited to be involved in emergency cellular adaptation to stresses. Remarkably, the same proteins have also the propensity to adopt self-perpetuating assemblies which properties fit the needs to encode cellular memory. Here, we review some of the principles of phase separation and the function of membrane-less organelles focusing particularly on their roles during stress response and cellular memory."

Most duplicated genes revert to single copy genes and only a small proportion are retained. However, it remains unclear why some duplicate genes persist in the genome for an extended time. We investigate this question by analysing retained gene duplicates in the fungal genus Epichlo\u00eb, ascomycete fungi that form close endophytic symbioses with their host grasses. Retained duplicates within this genus have two independent origins, but both long pre-date the origin and diversification of the genus Epichlo\u00eb. We find that loss of retained duplicates within the genus is frequent and often associated with speciation. Retained duplicates have faster evolutionary rates (Ka) and show relaxed selection (Ka/Ks) compared to single copy genes. Both features are time-dependent. Through comparison of conspecific strains, we find greater evolutionary rates in coding regions and sequence divergence in regulatory regions of retained duplicates than single copy genes, with this pattern more pronounced for strains adapted to different grass host species. Consistent with this sequence divergence in regulatory regions, transcriptome analyses show greater expression variation of retained duplicates than single copy genes. This suggest that cis-regulatory changes make important contributions to the expression patterns of retained duplicates. Coupled with supporting observations from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these data suggest that genetic robustness and regulatory plasticity are common drivers behind the retention of duplicated genes in fungi."

Some de novo repeat identification tools can efficiently generate sequence repetitive scores based on k-mer counting for repeat detection. However, we noticed that these tools can still be improved in terms of repetitive score calculation, sensitivity to segmental duplications and detection specificity. Therefore, here, we present a new computational approach named Repeat Locator (RepLoc), which is based on weighted k-mer coverage to quantify the genome sequence repetitiveness and locate the repetitive sequences. According to the repetitiveness map of the human genome generated by RepLoc, we found that there may be relationships between sequence repetitiveness and genome structures. A comprehensive benchmark shows that RepLoc is a more efficient k-mer counting based tool for de novo repeat detection. The RepLoc software is freely available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/reploc."

Here, we employed published datasets from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to identify insulated neighborhoods that confine promoter-enhancer interactions and demarcate gene regulatory regions. To directly address the functionality of these regions, we depleted estrogen-related receptor \u03b2 (Esrrb), which binds the Mediator co-activator complex, to impair enhancers of genes within 222 insulated neighborhoods without causing mESC differentiation. Esrrb depletion reduces Mediator binding, promoter-enhancer looping, and expression of both nascent RNA and mRNA within the insulated neighborhoods without significantly affecting the flanking genes. Our data indicate that insulated neighborhoods represent functional regulons in mammalian genomes."

The genomic era has enhanced biosynthetic understanding of these valuable chemical entities and has also provided a window into the diversity and distribution of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Antimycin is an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase and more recently was shown to inhibit Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-related anti-apoptotic proteins commonly overproduced by cancerous cells. Here we identify 73 putative antimycin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in publicly available genome sequences of Actinobacteria and classify them based on the presence or absence of cluster-situated genes antP and antQ, which encode a kynureninase and a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase), respectively. The majority of BGCs possess either both antP and antQ (L-form) or neither (S-form), while a minority of them lack either antP or antQ (IQ- or IP-form, respectively). We also evaluate the biogeographical distribution and phylogenetic relationships of antimycin producers and BGCs. We show that antimycin BGCs occur on five of the seven continents and are frequently isolated from plants and other higher organisms. We also provide evidence for two distinct phylogenetic clades of antimycin producers and gene clusters, which delineate S-form from L- and I-form BGCs. Finally, our findings suggest that the ancestral antimycin producer harboured an L-form gene cluster which was primarily propagated by vertical transmission and subsequently diversified into S-, IQ- and IP-form biosynthetic pathways."

However, the low diagnostic rates of 20-30% reported for multiple WES disease studies point to the need for improved variant pathogenicity classification and causal variant prioritization methods. Here, we present the exome Disease Variant Analysis (eDiVA; http://ediva.crg.eu), an automated computational framework for identification of causal genetic variants (coding/splicing single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions) for rare diseases using WES of families or parent-child trios. eDiVA combines next-generation sequencing data analysis, comprehensive functional annotation, and causal variant prioritization optimized for familial genetic disease studies. eDiVA features a machine learning-based variant pathogenicity predictor combining various genomic and evolutionary signatures. Clinical information, such as disease phenotype or mode of inheritance, is incorporated to improve the precision of the prioritization algorithm. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art competitors demonstrates that eDiVA consistently performed as a good or better than existing approach in terms of detection rate and precision. Moreover, we applied eDiVA to several familial disease cases to demonstrate its clinical applicability."

The capturing of the semantic relatedness of biological entities is vital to many biological applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction and literature-based discovery. Concept embeddings-which involve the learning of vector representations of concepts using machine learning models-have been employed to capture the semantics of concepts. To develop concept embeddings, named-entity recognition (NER) tools are first used to identify and normalize concepts from the literature, and then different machine learning models are used to train the embeddings. Despite multiple attempts, existing biomedical concept embeddings generally suffer from suboptimal NER tools, small-scale evaluation, and limited availability. In response, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on ~30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date. To evaluate the validity and utility of BioConceptVec, we respectively performed two intrinsic evaluations (identifying related concepts based on drug-gene and gene-gene interactions) and two extrinsic evaluations (protein-protein interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction extraction), collectively using over 25 million instances from nine independent datasets (17 million instances from six intrinsic evaluation tasks and 8 million instances from three extrinsic evaluation tasks), which is, by far, the most comprehensive to our best knowledge. The intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that BioConceptVec consistently has, by a large margin, better performance than existing concept embeddings in identifying similar and related concepts. More importantly, the extrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that using BioConceptVec with advanced deep learning models can significantly improve performance in downstream bioinformatics studies and biomedical text-mining applications. Our BioConceptVec embeddings and benchmarking datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioConceptVec."

Carbonylation was assessed by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine using both immunocytochemical and Western immunoblotting assays. Cigarette smoke induced increasing protein carbonylation in a concentration-dependent manner. The main carbonylated proteins were identified by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis and database search (redox proteomics). We demonstrated that exposure of bronchial cells to cigarette smoke extract induces carbonylation of a large number of proteins distributed throughout the cell. Proteins undergoing carbonylation are involved in primary metabolic processes, such as protein and lipid metabolism and metabolite and energy production as well as in fundamental cellular processes, such as cell cycle and chromosome segregation, thus confirming that reactive carbonyl species contained in cigarette smoke markedly alter cell homeostasis and functions."

DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulation, is one of the most widely altered mechanisms in prostate cancer. This phenomenon frames the basis to study the DNA methylation patterns in the promoter region of MIEN1. Bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrates the MIEN1 promoter contains a short interspersed nuclear Alu element (SINE Alu) repeat sequence. Validation of methylation inhibition on MIEN1 was performed using nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors and resulted in an increase in both MIEN1 RNA and protein in normal cells. MIEN1 mRNA and protein increases upon inhibition of individual DNA methyltransferases using RNA interference technologies. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays, in silico analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a sequence upstream of the transcription start site that has a site for binding of the USF transcription factors. These results suggest the MIEN1 promoter has a SINE Alu region that is hypermethylated in normal cells leading to repression of the gene. In cancer, the hypomethylation of a part of this repeat, in addition to the binding of USF, results in MIEN1 expression."

This causes a direct toxic effect, eventually leading to organ failure. The underlying B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is almost always a clonal plasma cell disorder, most often a small plasma cell clone of <10%. Current therapy is directed toward elimination of the plasma cell clone with the goal of preventing further organ damage and reversal of the existing organ damage. Autologous stem cell transplantation has been shown to be a very effective treatment in patients with AL amyloidosis, although it cannot be widely applied as patients are often frail at presentation, making them ineligible for transplantation. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone has emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. Novel anti-plasma cell therapies, such as second generation proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies targeting a surface protein on the plasma cell (daratumumab, elotuzumab), and the small molecular inhibitor venetoclax, have continued to emerge and are being evaluated in combination with the standard of care. However, there is still a need for therapies that directly target the amyloid fibrils and reverse organ damage. In this review, we will discuss current and emerging nonchemotherapy treatments of AL amyloidosis, including antifibril directed therapies under current investigation."

However, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market due to lack of clinical benefit in the confirmatory phase III trial. In 2012, several investigator cooperative studies using a different dosing regimen showed efficacy, but pharmacokinetic (PK) data were not collected in these trials. Through simulation of expected concentrations for new dosing regimens, PK/pharmacodynamic modeling was able to support the safety and efficacy of these regimens. Significant exposure-response relationships were found for the attainment of complete remission with and without platelet recovery, attainment of blast-free status, the time course of myelosuppression, several grade\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 hepatic adverse events, and veno-occlusive disease. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin received full approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2017 for newly diagnosed and relapsed AML in adult patients and relapsed AML in pediatric patients aged 2-17\u00a0years."

In this study, the clinical, demographic, and genetic features of ALS patients in the city of Sakarya, Turkey, were investigated. Patients with an established diagnosis of ALS according to the Awaji criteria were included. Age, sex, age at onset of ALS, initial complaints, consanguineous marriage, and genetic features were retrospectively investigated. Conventional genetic analysis and NGS were used for molecular evaluation of patients. A total of 55 probands (10 familial, 45 sporadic) in whom ALS was suspected due to their phenotypic features were included. Thirty-two patients were male (58.2%), and 23 were female (41.8%); their mean ages were 62.65\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0years. The mean age of onset for 37 familial patients from 10 families was 49.9\u00a0years. Two cases had juvenile-onset. Fourteen (25.5%) bulbar-onset versus 40 (72.7%) limb-onset patients were detected; one patient had both. Six (10.9%) patients showed marked frontotemporal dementia. Twenty-nine (52.7%) patients died during the follow-up period. Genetic analysis identified causative variants in eleven cases, carrying variants in six different ALS genes (C9orf72, SOD1, VCP, SPG11, TBK1, and SH3TC2). Genetic investigations have revealed more than 40 genes to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. Our relatively small study cohort restricted to one province of Turkey, however, prone to migration, consists of 10/55 familial ALS cases, which harbor two rare (SH3TC2-p.Met523Thr and TBK1-p.Glu643del) and two novel (SPG11-p.Lys656Valfs*11 and VCP-p.Arg191Pro) mutations contributing to the literature."

Although not approved for such treatment, alemtuzumab is also active against T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and S\u00e9zary syndrome, and adult T cell leukaemia and lymphoma. In addition, rituximab has demonstrated activity against B cell chronic lymphocytic and hairy cell leukaemia. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD4, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD45, CD66 and CD122 are now being studied in the clinic for the treatment of leukaemia. Here, we discuss how these new antibodies have been engineered to reduce immunogenicity and improve antibody targeting and binding. Improved interactions with Fc receptors on immune effector cells can enhance destruction of target cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. The antibodies can also be armed with cellular toxins or radionuclides to enhance the destruction of leukaemia cells."

We reveal them to be five previously unappreciated cell adhesion molecules whose domain architecture has an early holozoan origin prior to the emergence of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals.

                    "context": "The onco-suppressor p53 protein plays also an important role in the control of various aspects of health and disease. p53 levels are low in normal cells and elevated under stress conditions. While low levels of p53 promote tumor formation, overactive p53 leads to premature aging and cell death. RNA degradation is a critical level of regulation contributing to the control of gene expression. p53, as an RNA-binding protein, exerts 3'\u2009\u2192\u20095' exoribonuclease activity, mediating degradation of adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (ARE)-containing ssRNAs. The 3'-UTR of p53-mRNA, which is a target of p53 itself, harbors cis-acting AREs. Our results suggest that p53 controls its own expression through murine double-minute 2 (mdm2)-independent \"RNA decay\" function in cytoplasm. We demonstrate that p53 expresses an exoribonuclease activity through the binding to ARE sequences of p53-mRNA via translation-independent and translation-dependent polysome-associated pathways. Antagonistic interplay\u00a0was detected between p53\u00a0levels and execution of its exoribonuclease function mirrored in low p53 levels in normal cells,\u00a0due to the efficient exoribonuclease activity, and in the accumulation of p53 in cells exposed to p53-activating drugs in accordance with the reduced exoribonuclease activity. Apparently, p53, via control of its own mRNA stability and/or translation in cytoplasm, might act as a negative regulator of p53-mRNA levels. The observed connection between exoribonuclease activity and p53 abundance highlights the importance of this function affecting p53 expression, imperative for multiple functions, with implications for the steady-state levels of protein and for the p53 stress response. The modulation in expression of exoribonuclease activity would be translated into the alterations in p53 level. KEY MESSAGES: p53 controls its own expression through mdm2-independent \"RNA decay\" function in cytoplasm. p53 expresses an exoribonuclease activity through the binding to ARE sequences of p53-mRNA. Antagonistic interplay exists between stress-induced p53 and execution of its exoribonuclease function."

In addition, their therapeutic potential may be enhanced by the introduction of defined mutations in the crystallizable fragment (Fc) domains eg YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) and LS (M428L/N434S), as a consequence of increased half-lives and prolonged duration of protection. However, the functional properties of any biologic may be compromised by unanticipated immunogenicity in humans, rendering them ineffective. Several potent broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified that protect against SHIV challenge in macaque models and reduce HIV viremia in HIV-infected individuals. In the present study, the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of one or more 5mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injections in na\u00efve macaques of the HIV bnAb PGT121 and its PGT121-YTE mutant, both produced in plants, have been compared towards prolonging efficacy. Induction of anti-drug/anti-idiotypic antibodies (ADA, anti-id) has been monitored using both binding ELISAs and more functional inhibition of virus neutralization (ID50) assays. Timing of the anti-Id responses and their impact on pharmacokinetic profiles (clearance) and efficacy (protection) have also been assessed. The results indicate that ADA induction in na\u00efve macaques may result both from injection of the previously non-immunogenic PGT121 into pre-primed animals and also by the introduction of the YTE mutation. Binding ADA antibody levels, induced in 7/10 macaques within two weeks of a first or second PGT121-YTE injection, were closely associated with both reduced pharmacokinetic profiles and loss of protection. However no correlation was observed with inhibitory ADA activity. These studies provide insights into both the structural features of bnAb and the immune status of the host which may contribute to the development of ADA in macaques and describe possible YTE-mediated changes in structure/orientation of HIV bnAbs that trigger such responses."

Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that all three versions of the anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins bound to the human CCR4(+) tumor cell line as well as CCR4(+) human PBMC. The bivalent isoform bound stronger than its monovalent counterpart and the single-chain foldback diabody isoform was the strongest among the three versions. In\u00a0vitro efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform was 20 fold more potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CCR4(+) tumor cells compared to the monovalent anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin. The single-chain fold-back diabody isoform was 10 fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart and 200 fold more potent than its monovalent counterpart. The in\u00a0vivo efficacy was assessed using a human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mouse model. The immunotoxin significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor \u03b3(-/-) (NSG) mice injected with human CCR4(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells compared with the control group.

The cognitive assessment in UK Biobank is brief and bespoke, and is administered without supervision on a touchscreen computer. Psychometric information on the UK Biobank cognitive tests are limited. Despite the non-standard nature of these tests and the limited psychometric information, the UK Biobank cognitive data have been used in numerous scientific publications. The present study examined the validity and short-term test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank cognitive tests. A sample of 160 participants (mean age = 62.59, SD = 10.24) was recruited who completed the UK Biobank cognitive assessment and a range of well-validated cognitive tests ('reference tests'). Fifty-two participants returned 4 weeks later to repeat the UK Biobank tests. Correlations were calculated between UK Biobank tests and reference tests. Two measures of general cognitive ability were created by entering scores on the UK Biobank cognitive tests, and scores on the reference tests, respectively, into separate principal component analyses and saving scores on the first principal component. Four-week test-retest correlations were calculated for UK Biobank tests. UK Biobank cognitive tests showed a range of correlations with their respective reference tests, i.e. those tests that are thought to assess the same underlying cognitive ability (mean Pearson r = 0.53, range = 0.22 to 0.83, p\u2264.005). The measure of general cognitive ability based on the UK Biobank cognitive tests correlated at r = 0.83 (p < .001) with a measure of general cognitive ability created using the reference tests. Four-week test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank tests were moderate-to-high (mean Pearson r = 0.55, range = 0.40 to 0.89, p\u2264.003). Despite the brief, non-standard nature of the UK Biobank cognitive tests, some tests showed substantial concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. These psychometric results provide currently-lacking information on the validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests."

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease has improved in recent years. The process is primarily driven by the Th2 pathway, but with significant contributions from the Th22 pathway, the Th1 and Th17 axes, epidermal barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and JAK/STAT signaling. Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis have led to the development of new systemic treatments. Of particular note are biologic agents targeting IL-4 and IL-13 (e. g., dupilumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab) and small molecules, such as JAK inhibitors (e. g., baricitinib, upadacitinib, and abrocitinib). Novel topical treatments include phosphodiesterase 4 and JAK/STAT inhibitors. In this article, we review the main advances in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Characterization of clinical and molecular phenotypes with a key pathogenic role is essential for driving these advances."

Previous studies have investigated the role of de novo Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and microRNAs as important but distinct etiological factors in ASD. We developed a novel computational procedure to assess the potential pathogenic role of microRNA genes overlapping de novo CNVs in ASD patients. Here we show that for chromosomes # 1, 2 and 22 the actual number of miRNA loci affected by de novo CNVs in patients was found significantly higher than that estimated by Monte Carlo simulation of random CNV events. Out of 24 miRNA genes over-represented in CNVs from these three chromosomes only hsa-mir-4436b-1 and hsa-mir-4436b-2 have not been detected in CNVs from non-autistic subjects as reported in the Database of Genomic Variants. Altogether the results reported in this study represent a first step towards a full understanding of how a dysregulated expression of the 24 miRNAs genes affect neurodevelopment in autism. We also propose that the procedure used in this study can be effectively applied to CNVs/miRNA genes association data in other genomic disorders beyond autism. "

A clinically used cART (atazanavir-ritonavir+Truvada) was given orally to control and HIV-1-Tg rats (18 weeks) with normal or 6-fold dietary-Mg. Oxidative/nitrosative and lipogenic genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR. cART induced a 4-fold upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in HIV-1-Tg-rats, but not in controls; Tg rats displayed a 2.5-fold higher expression. Both were completely prevented by Mg-supplementation. Nrf2 (Nuclear erythroid-derived factor 2), a master transcription factor controlling redox homeostasis, was down-regulated 50% in HIV-Tg rats, and reduced further to 25% in Tg+cART-rats. Two downstream antioxidant genes, heme oxygenase-1(HmOX1) and Glutathione-S-transferase(GST), were elevated in HIV-Tg alone but were suppressed by cART treatment. Decreased Nrf2 in Tg\u00b1cART were normalized by Mg-supplementation along with the reversal of altered HmOX1 and GST expression. Concomitantly, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) was upregulated 2-fold in Tg+cART rats, which was reversed by Mg-supplementation. In parallel, cART-treatment led to substantial increases in plasma 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and RBC-GSSG (oxidized glutathione) levels in HIV-1-Tg rats; all indices of oxidative/nitrosative stress were suppressed by Mg-supplementation. Both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated in Tg+cART rats, but were lowered by Mg-supplementation. Thus, the synergistic effects of cART and HIV-1 expression on lipogenic and oxidative/nitrosative effects were revealed at the genomic and biochemical levels. Down-regulation of Nrf2 in the Tg+cART rats suggested their antioxidant response was severely compromised; these abnormal metabolic and oxidative stress effects were effectively attenuated by Mg-supplementation at the genomic level."

However, current analytical solutions for chloride detection fail to meet the clinical needs of both high performance and low material or labor costs, hindering translation into clinical settings. Here we present a new class of fluorescence chloride sensors derived from a facile citrate -based synthesis platform that utilize dynamic quenching mechanisms. Based on this low-cost platform, we demonstrate for the first time a selective sensing strategy that uses a single fluorophore to detect multiple halides simultaneously, promising both selectivity and automation to improve performance and reduce labor costs. We also demonstrate the clinical utility of citrate-based sensors as a new sweat chloride test method for the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis by performing analytical validation with sweat controls and clinical validation with sweat from individuals with or without Cystic Fibrosis. Lastly, molecular modeling studies reveal the structural mechanism behind chloride sensing, serving to expand this class of fluorescence sensors with improved chloride sensitivities. Thus citrate-based fluorescent materials may enable low-cost, automated multi-analysis systems for simpler, yet accurate, point-of-care diagnostics that can be readily translated into clinical settings. More broadly, a wide range of medical, industrial, and environmental applications can be achieved with such a facile synthesis platform, demonstrated in our citrate-based biodegradable polymers with intrinsic fluorescence sensing."

With the recent advancements in sequencing techniques, sufficient genomic data has become available to train models that predict the evolutionary statistical energies, but there is still inadequate experimental data to directly predict functional effects. One approach to overcome this data scarcity is to apply transfer learning and train more models with available data sets. In this study, we propose a set of transfer learning algorithms we call TLmutation, which implements a supervised transfer learning algorithm that transfers knowledge from survival data of a protein to a particular function of that protein. This is followed by an unsupervised transfer learning algorithm that extends the knowledge to a homologous protein. We explore the application of our algorithms in three cases. First, we test the supervised transfer on 17 previously published deep mutagenesis data sets to complete and refine missing data points. We further investigate these data sets to identify which mutations build better predictors of variant functions. In the second case, we apply the algorithm to predict higher-order mutations solely from single point mutagenesis data. Finally, we perform the unsupervised transfer learning algorithm to predict mutational effects of homologous proteins from experimental data sets. These algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models. We show the benefit of our transfer learning algorithms to utilize informative deep mutational data and provide new insights into protein variant functions. As these algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models, we expect these algorithms to be applicable to other disciplines."

The average detected levels of individual pesticides were approximately 10-100\u00a0ng/L. Organophosphorus pesticides and carbamate pesticides were the dominant pesticides, and their percentage of total pesticide concentrations were 35.9% and 55.5%, respectively.

Nine core pesticides and three distinct clusters of the core pesticides with various concentration patterns were revealed by cluster analysis. Linear regression identified a significant relationship between the cumulative detections and the cumulative concentrations, providing access to identify the outlying contaminant events that deviate substantially from the linear trend. A new insight for prediction of pesticide occurrence was provided by the Pearson correlation between some individual pesticide concentrations and the cumulative detections or the cumulative concentrations.

Due to its high treatment efficacy, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is generally accepted as a promising experimental treatment for patients suffering from GM imbalances (dysbiosis), e.g. caused by recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDI). Mounting evidence suggests that bacteriophages (phages) play a key role in successful FMT treatment by restoring the dysbiotic bacterial GM. As a refinement to FMT, removing the bacterial component of donor feces by sterile filtration, also referred to as fecal virome transplantation (FVT), decreases the risk of invasive infections caused by bacteria. However, eukaryotic viruses and prophage-encoded virulence factors remain a safety issue. Recent in vivo studies show how cascading effects are initiated when phage communities are transferred to the gut by e.g. FVT, which leads to changes in the GM composition, host metabolome, and improve host health such as alleviating symptoms of obesity and type-2-diabetes (T2D). In this review, we discuss the promises and limitations of FVT along with the perspectives of using FVT to treat various diseases associated with GM dysbiosis."

The somatic mutations, recording the unique genetic cell-lineage 'history' of each proliferating normal cell, are important but remain to be investigated because of their ultra-low frequency hidden in the genetic background of heterogeneous cells. Luckily, the recent development of single-cell genomics biotechnologies enables the screening and collection of the somatic mutations, especial single nucleotide variations (SNVs), occurring in normal cells. Here, we established DSMNC: a database of somatic mutations in normal cells (http://dsmnc.big.ac.cn/), which provides most comprehensive catalogue of somatic SNVs in single cells from various normal tissues. In the current version, the database collected \u223c0.8 million SNVs accumulated in \u223c600 single normal cells (579 human cells and 39 mouse cells). The database interface supports the user-friendly capability of browsing and searching the SNVs and their annotation information. DSMNC, which serves as a timely and valuable collection of somatic mutations in individual normal cells, has made it possible to analyze the burdens and signatures of somatic mutations in various types of heterogeneous normal cells. Therefore, DSMNC will significantly improve our understanding of the characteristics of somatic mutations in normal cells."

Gingipains are produced by two species of bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas gulae, typically associated with periodontal disease and systemic infections in humans and dogs, respectively. P.\u00a0gulae infection in dogs is associated with periodontal disease, which provides a physiologically relevant model to investigate the pharmacology of COR388. In the current study, aged dogs with a natural oral infection of P.\u00a0gulae and periodontal disease were treated with COR388 by oral administration for up to 90\u00a0days to assess lysine-gingipain target engagement and reduction of bacterial load and downstream pathology. In a 28-day dose-response study, COR388 inhibited the lysine-gingipain target and reduced P.\u00a0gulae load in saliva, buccal cells, and gingival crevicular fluid. The lowest effective dose was continued for 90\u00a0days and was efficacious in continuous reduction of bacterial load and downstream periodontal disease pathology. In a separate histology study, dog brain tissue showed evidence of P.\u00a0gulae DNA and neuronal lysine-gingipain, demonstrating that P.\u00a0gulae infection is systemic and spreads beyond its oral reservoir, similar to recent observations of P.\u00a0gingivalis in humans. Together, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COR388 lysine-gingipain inhibition, along with reduction of bacterial load and periodontal disease in naturally occurring P.\u00a0gulae infection in the dog, support the use of COR388 in targeting lysine-gingipain and eliminating P.\u00a0gingivalis infection in humans."

Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease when treatment options are limited to palliative approaches, mainly focused on chemotherapy. In recent years, novel treatment targets of relevance to biliary tract cancers, mainly present in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, have been identified and are rapidly changing the field. These include fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) fusions and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 and -2 mutations which are each present in around 10-20% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, inhibition of other pathways/molecules is currently being explored, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family members, the Wnt pathway, neurotropic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) fusions and BRAF mutations. The IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib has already been tested in a phase III clinical trial in pretreated cholangiocarcinoma and showed benefit in terms of progression-free survival. Multiple FGFR inhibitors have consistently shown high response rates in phase II/III trials, especially for patients harbouring FGFR2 fusions. This review provides an overview of the status of targeted therapies in biliary tract cancers. Detailed discussion regarding current clinical development of IDH and FGFR inhibitors is provided, with an overview of current caveats and future steps."

Aimovig is also the first FDA-approved mAb against a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Here, we report the architecture and functional attributes of erenumab critical for its potent antagonism against CGRPR. The crystal structure of erenumab in complex with CGRPR reveals a direct ligand-blocking mechanism, enabled by a remarkable 21-residue-long complementary determining region (CDR)-H3 loop, which adopts a tyrosine-rich helix-turn tip and projects into the deep interface of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and RAMP1 subunits of CGRPR. Furthermore, erenumab engages with residues specific to CLR and RAMP1, providing the molecular basis for its exquisite selectivity. Such structural insights reveal the drug action mechanism of erenumab and shed light on developing antibody therapeutics targeting GPCRs."

Dopamine deficiency is thought to disrupt motor control of the basal ganglia and cause characteristic motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease such as bradykinesia, akinesia, and tremor. Therefore, dopamine replacement therapy is widely used in the clinical setting. Safinamide is a novel, selective, and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B expected to increase dopamine levels in the brain and improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In addition, safinamide shows non-dopaminergic actions such as sodium channel blockade and inhibition of glutamate release. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that safinamide ameliorates \"wearing off\" symptoms after administration in rat and monkey models with selectively destroyed dopaminergic neurons. In the monkeys, safinamide concurrently inhibited levodopa-induced dyskinesia. These findings suggest that safinamide not only increases the dopaminergic effect of levodopa, but also reduces levodopa-induced adverse events via its non-dopaminergic effects. In clinical trials of patients with Parkinson's disease with the \"wearing off\" phenomenon, safinamide has been found to prolong the \"on time\" and improve motor function as assessed by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III. In Japan, safinamide was approved in September 2019 as a levodopa combination drug for Parkinson's disease with \"wearing off\" phenomenon. Safinamide is therefore expected to be a new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease."

The absolute oral bioavailability of apixaban is\u2009~\u200950%. Food does not have a clinically meaningful impact on the bioavailability. Apixaban exposure increases dose proportionally for oral doses up to 10\u00a0mg. Apixaban is rapidly absorbed, with maximum concentration occurring 3-4\u00a0h after oral administration, and has a half-life of approximately 12\u00a0h. Elimination occurs via multiple pathways including metabolism, biliary excretion, and direct intestinal excretion, with approximately 27% of total apixaban clearance occurring via renal excretion. The pharmacokinetics of apixaban are consistent across a broad range of patients, and apixaban has limited clinically relevant interactions with most commonly prescribed medications, allowing for fixed dosages without the need for therapeutic drug monitoring. The pharmacodynamic effect of apixaban is closely correlated with apixaban plasma concentration. This review provides a summary of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, biopharmaceutical, and drug-drug interaction profiles of apixaban. Additionally, the population-pharmacokinetic analyses of apixaban in both healthy subjects and in the target patient populations are discussed."

Our previous study showed vaspin expression and its regulation in the ovary; however, the role of this adipokine in ovarian cells has never been studied. Here, we studied in vitro the effect of vaspin on various kinase signaling pathways: mitogen-activated kinase (MAP3/1), serine/threonine kinase (AKT), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein kinase AMP (PRKAA1), protein kinase A (PKA) and on expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB2) as well as on steroid synthesis by porcine ovarian cells. By Western blot, we found that vaspin (1\u00a0ng/ml), in a time-dependent manner, increased phosphorylation of MAP3/1, AKT, STAT3, PRKAA1 and PKA, while it decreased expression of NFKB2. We observed that vaspin, in a dose-dependent manner, increased basal steroid hormones secretion (progesterone and estradiol), mRNA and protein expression of steroid enzymes using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively, and the mRNA of gonadotropins (FSHR, LHCGR) and steroids (PGR, ESR2) receptors. The stimulatory effect of vaspin on basal steroidogenesis was reversed when ovarian cells were cultured in the presence of a PKA pharmacological inhibitor (KT5720) and when GRP78 receptor was knocked down (siRNA). However, in the presence of insulin-like growth factor type 1 and gonadotropins, vaspin reduced steroidogenesis. Thus, vaspin, by activation of various signaling pathways and stimulation of basal steroid production via GRP78 receptor and PKA, could be a new regulator of porcine ovarian function."

Evidence suggests that pathological mechanisms involved in the development of AD are associated with cholinergic deficit, glutamate excitotoxicity, beta-amyloid aggregation, tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, and oxidative damage to neurons. Currently there is no cure for AD; however, synthetic therapies have been developed to effectively manage some of the symptoms at the early stage of the disease. Natural products from plants and marine organisms have been identified as important sources of bioactive compounds with neuroprotective potentials and less adverse effects compared to synthetic agents. Seaweeds contain several kinds of secondary metabolites such as phlorotannins, carotenoids, sterols, fucoidans, and poly unsaturated fatty acids. However, their neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of action have not been fully explored. This review discusses recent investigations and/or updates on interactions of bioactive compounds from seaweeds with biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of AD using reports in electronic databases such as Web of science, Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Scifinder, Taylor and Francis, Wiley, Springer, and Google scholar between 2015 and 2019. Phlorotannins, fucoidans, sterols, and carotenoids showed strong neuroprotective potentials in different experimental models. However, there are no data from human studies and/or clinical trials."

Here, we identified inx-4, a member of the innexin family in C. elegans, by a forward screening as a thermotaxis-defective mutant. The inx-4 mutants exhibited abnormal migration to a temperature slightly higher than the cultivation temperature. Rescue experiments revealed that INX-4 acts only in the major thermosensory neuron AFD to control thermotaxis. INX-4::GFP fusion protein localized exclusively along axons in AFD neurons. In contrast to the inx-4 mutants, overexpression of INX-4 in AFD neurons induced a cryophilic behavior. These data suggest that inx-4 may be required for fine-tuning in the execution process of thermotaxis moving to desired temperatures."

Of these three fatty acid-binding proteins, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein is of the most interest due to its exclusive expression in the gastrointestinal tract. The elevation of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in blood and urine reflects enterocyte damage, regardless of the underlying cause. The short half-life of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein also means it is a relatively sensitive marker. In contrast, there is currently less evidence to support liver fatty acid-binding protein and ileal bile acid-binding protein as sensitive biomarkers in these conditions. More extensive studies with specific endpoints are required to validate the roles of these fatty acid-binding proteins in gastrointestinal diseases."

For the first time in history, a solid cancer treatment was approved based on the genetic makeup of tumor not on the location in the body where the cancer originated, for example lung or breast cancer (TNM staging). This indication covers patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options and patients with colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapeutics. All cancer drug approvals in the last 30 years were grounded on TNM staging independent of the therapy type (chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, TKI inhibitors, immune therapies or targeted therapies) and despite the huge and fast advances in understanding tumor biology. In fact, the FDA previously approved pembrolizumab taking into consideration the TNM staging, for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. The archaic TNM staging will probably be changed under the disruptive wave of molecular biology. The recent FDA approval could be considered the certificate of birth for a truly new dimension of personalized medicine in cancer. We recommend European Union to follow the FDA approach of tissue-agnostic cancer drugs in order to speed up the development of next-generation oncologic therapies and to increase the access of patients to truly personalized medicine."

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, and direct oral factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban-are currently frequently used for the prevention and treatment of VTE in adult population. In fact, these agents offer several advantages compared to traditional agents, such as oral route of administration, short on-set and off-set of action, predictable pharmacologic profile with low risk of food and drug interactions, and no need for routine laboratory assessment of anticoagulant activity. However, clinical experience with these directly acting oral anticoagulants in pediatric population is very limited as these drugs had been tested and are used mostly in adult individuals. This article reviews the current data from pre- and post-marketing studies reporting the use of DOACs for the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients."

Oleuropein is a secoiridoid type of phenolic compound and consists of three structural subunits: hydroxytyrosol, elenolic acid, and a glucose molecule. It is also reported to be the chemotaxonomic marker of olive. The oleuropein is reported to possess a number of biological activities including action against dyslipidemia, antiobesity, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiatherogenic, antihypertensive, antiinflammatory, and hepatoprotective actions. The scientific evidence supports the role of oleuropein as a potential agent against metabolic syndrome.

A total of 226 AFLP loci were genotyped in 166 individuals from nine populations. The results demonstrated low gene diversity, ranging from 0.095 to 0.133 and significant genetic differentiation ranging from 0.115 to 0.408. Seven genetic clusters were revealed by Bayesian clustering methods as well as by Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components and each population formed its respective cluster. The exception were populations P02 Mt. Shara and P07 Mt. Vermio, that were admixed between two clusters. Both landscape genetic methods Mcheza and BayeScan identified a total of seven (3.10%) markers exhibiting higher levels of genetic differentiation among populations. The spatial analysis method Sam\u03b2ada detected 50 individual markers (22.12%) associated with bioclimatic variables, among them seven were identified by both Mcheza and BayeScan as being under directional selection. Four bioclimatic variables associated with five out of seven outliers were related to precipitation, suggesting that this variable is the key factor affecting the adaptive variation of S. scardica."

This study reports on the mutually exclusive distribution of Cpn60 and extranuclear DNA in E. histolytica and on the distribution of Cpn60-containing mitosomes in this parasite. In situ nick-translation coupled to immunofluorescence microscopy failed to detect the presence of DNA in mitosomes, either in fixed parasite trophozoites or in partially purified organellar fractions. These results indicate that a remnant organellar genome has not been retained in E. histolytica mitosomes and demonstrate unequivocally that EhKOs and mitosomes are distinct and unrelated cellular structures."

Rare, yet highly successful attempts to combine these therapeutic platforms have also been reported. Interestingly, both approaches have shown pronounced efficacy in human trials, albeit these were limited to just a handful of malignancies. Specifically, CD19-specific CAR-T cell products (Kymriah and Yescarta) have been highly effective against B cell lymphomas and leukemias, whereas administering oncolytic viruses resulted in pronounced responses in melanoma (Imlygic and Rigvir) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Oncorine) patients. It is well established that efficacy of virotherapy as a standalone approach is largely restricted by the pre-existing and mounting immune response against viral antigens, and requires a relatively functional immune system, which is not typical for cancer patients, with the current antitumor therapy schemes. On the other hand, the most important challenges faced by the current CAR-T cell therapy formats include the lack of targetable tumor-specific surface antigens, tumor cell heterogeneity, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, not to mention the unacceptably high costs. Remarkably, combining the two approaches may help address their individual bottlenecks. Namely, local acute inflammatory reaction induced by the viral infection may reverse tumor-associated immunosuppression and lead to more efficient homing and penetration of CAR-expressing lymphocytes into the tumor stroma; combined viral and CAR-mediated cytotoxicity may ensure the production of immunogenic cell debris and efficient presentation of tumor neoantigens, and potently recruit the patient's own bystander immune cells to attack cancer cells. Thus, testing the combinations of CAR-based and virolytic approaches in the clinical setting appears both logical and highly promising."

YB2/RYB-a is thought to be the rat orthologue of mouse Y-box protein 3 (MSY3). An antibody which recognizes YB2/RYB-a was developed and applied in an immunochemical study of rat and mouse testes. We also carried out an in-situ hybridization study and Northern blot analysis of YB2/RYB-a and protamine 2 mRNA expression. Both YB2/RYB-a mRNA and the proteins appeared in prepubertal mouse testes, prior to the expression of the mouse protamine 2 mRNA. The mRNA and protein were present at high levels in spermatocytes, decreased in round to elongated spermatids, and were absent in spermatozoa. Since the protamine 2 mRNA was present at high levels in round and elongating spermatids, the proposed function of the YB2/RYB-a protein as a translational repressor of the mRNA was supported in mouse. The level and localization of YB2/RYB-a mRNA and protein expression in the rat testis was comparable to that in mouse testis, although rat testis is known to express a very low level of protamine 2, but is also likely to affect the expression of other proteins (including protamine 1) during spermatogenesis."

In humans, cofilin-2 (CFL2) mutations have been associated with congenital myopathies that include nemaline and myofibrillar myopathy. To understand the pathogenicity of the human CFL2 mutation, p.A35T, that first linked cofilin-2 with the human disease, we created a knock-in mouse model. The Cfl2A35T/A35T (KI) mouse were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates at birth, but they rapidly worsened and died by postnatal day 9. The phenotypic, histopathologic and molecular findings mimicked the constitutive Cfl2-knockout (KO) mice described previously, including sarcomeric disruption and actin accumulations in skeletal muscles and negligible amounts of cofilin-2 protein. In addition, KI mice demonstrated a marked reduction in Cfl2 mRNA levels in various tissues including skeletal muscles. Further investigation revealed evidence of alternative splicing with the presence of two alternate transcripts of smaller size. These alternate transcripts were expressed at very low levels in the wild-type mice and were significantly upregulated in the mutant mice, indicating that pre-translational splicing defects may be a critical component of the disease mechanism associated with the mutation. Evidence of reduced expression of the full-length CFL2 transcript was also observed in the muscle biopsy sample of the patient with p.A35T mutation."

RUNX2 has been shown to play an important role in cell differentiation, but the regulation of Runx2 expression and its function in the ovary remain to be determined. The present study examined 1) the expression profile of Runx2 and its partner CBFbeta during the periovulatory period, 2) regulatory mechanisms of Runx2 expression, and 3) its potential function in the ovary. Runx2 expression was induced in periovulatory granulosa cells of human and rodent ovaries. RUNX2 and core binding factor-beta (CBFbeta) proteins in nuclear extracts and RUNX2 binding to a consensus binding sequence increased after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. This in vivo up-regulation of Runx2 expression was recapitulated in vitro in preovulatory granulosa cells by stimulation with hCG. The hCG-induced Runx2 expression was reduced by antiprogestin (RU486) and EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG1478), indicating the involvement of EGF-signaling and progesterone-mediated pathways. We also found that in the C/EBPbeta knockout mouse ovary, Runx2 expression was reduced, indicating C/EBPbeta-mediated expression. Next, the function of RUNX2 was investigated by suppressing Runx2 expression by small interfering RNA in vitro. Runx2 knockdown resulted in reduced levels of mRNA for Rgc32, Ptgds, Fabp6, Mmp13, and Abcb1a genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the binding of RUNX2 in the promoter region of these genes, suggesting that these genes are direct downstream targets of RUNX2. Collectively, the present data indicate that the LH surge-induced RUNX2 is involved in various aspects of luteal function by directly regulating the expression of diverse luteal genes."

An early wave featured injectable (i.e., intramuscular, subcutaneous) biodegradable polymeric microspheres to control drug release profiles for peptides and small molecules (e.g., Lupron Depot\u00ae, Risperdal Consta\u00ae). With these early successes for microspheres, research shifted to exploring systemic delivery by intravenous injection, which required smaller particle sizes and modified surface properties (e.g., PEGylation) to enable long circulation times. These new innovations resulted in the nanoparticle medicines Doxil\u00ae and Abraxane\u00ae, designed to improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic cancer agents by decreasing systemic exposure and delivering more drug to tumors. Very recently, the first siRNA lipid nanoparticle medicine, Patisiran (Onpattro\u00ae), was approved for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

This control incorporates the intrinsic physical anisotropy of tubes to generate proportionate organs that match their function. The exact mechanisms underlying tube size control and how tubular anisotropy is translated at the cellular level are still not fully understood. Here we investigate these mechanisms using the Drosophila tracheal system. We show that the apical polarity protein Crumbs transiently accumulates anisotropically at longitudinal cell junctions during tube elongation. We provide evidence indicating that the accumulation of Crumbs in specific apical domains correlates with apical surface expansion, suggesting a link between the anisotropic accumulation of Crumbs at the cellular level and membrane expansion. We find that Src42A is required for the anisotropic accumulation of Crumbs, thereby identifying the first polarised cell behaviour downstream of Src42A. Our results indicate that Src42A regulates a mechanism that increases the fraction of Crb protein at longitudinal junctions, and genetic interaction experiments are consistent with Crb acting downstream of Src42A in controlling tube size. Collectively, our results suggest a model in which Src42A would sense the inherent anisotropic mechanical tension of the tube and translate it into a polarised Crumbs accumulation, which may promote a bias towards longitudinal membrane expansion, orienting cell elongation and, as a consequence, longitudinal growth at the tissue level. This work provides new insights into the key question of how organ growth is controlled and polarised and unveils the function of two conserved proteins, Crumbs and Src42A, with important roles in development and homeostasis as well as in disease, in this biological process."

Plasma ghrelin levels are robustly regulated by feeding status, with its levels increasing upon caloric restriction and decreasing after food intake. At least some of this regulation might be due to direct responsiveness of ghrelin cells to changes in circulating nutrients, including glucose. Indeed, oral and parental glucose administration to humans and mice lower plasma ghrelin. Also dissociated mouse gastric mucosal cell preparations, which contain ghrelin cells, decrease ghrelin secretion when cultured in high ambient glucose. Here, we used primary cultures of mouse gastric mucosal cells in combination with an array of pharmacologic tools to examine the potential role of changed intracellular oxidative stress in glucose-restricted ghrelin secretion. The antioxidants resveratrol, SRT1720, and curcurmin all markedly increased ghrelin secretion. Furthermore, three different selective activators of Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2), a master regulator of the antioxidative cellular response to oxidative stress, increased ghrelin secretion. These antioxidant compounds blocked the inhibitory effects of glucose on ghrelin secretion. Therefore, we conclude that lowering oxidative stress within ghrelin cells stimulates ghrelin secretion and blocks the direct effects of glucose on ghrelin cells to inhibit ghrelin secretion."

Here, we have investigated how fibroblasts from Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) patients with mutated SAMHD1 react to the constitutive pool imbalance characterized by a huge dGTP pool. We focused on the effects on dNTP pools, cell cycle progression, dynamics and fidelity of DNA replication, and efficiency of UV-induced DNA repair. AGS fibroblasts entered senescence prematurely or upregulated genes involved in G1/S transition and DNA replication. The normally growing AGS cells exhibited unchanged DNA replication dynamics and, when quiescent, faster rate of excision repair of UV-induced DNA damages. To investigate whether the lack of SAMHD1 affects DNA replication fidelity, we compared de novo mutations in AGS and WT cells by exome next-generation sequencing. Somatic variant analysis indicated a mutator phenotype suggesting that SAMHD1 is a caretaker gene whose deficiency is per se mutagenic, promoting genome instability in non-transformed cells."

Although well recognized as a tumor suppressor, involvement of PTEN mutations in mediating such a diverse range of phenotypes indicates a more central involvement for PTEN in immunity than previously recognized. To address this, sequencing of the T-cell receptor variable-region \u03b2-chain (TCRVB) was performed on peripheral blood from PHTS patients. Based on patient findings, we performed mechanistic studies in two Pten knock-in murine models, distinct from each other in cell compartment-specific predominance of Pten. We found that PTEN mutations in humans and mice are associated with a skewed T- and B-cell gene repertoire, characterized by increased prevalence of high frequency clones. Immunological characterization showed that Pten mutants have increased B-cell proliferation and a proclivity towards increased T-cell reactivity upon Toll-like-receptor stimulation. Furthermore, decreases in nuclear but not cytoplasmic Pten levels associated with a reduction in expression of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire), a critical mediator of central immune tolerance. Mechanistically, we show that nuclear PTEN most likely regulates Aire expression via its emerging role in splicing regulation. We conclude that germline disruption of PTEN, both in human and mouse, results in compromised central immune tolerance processes that may significantly impact individual stress-responses and therefore predisposition to autoimmunity and cancer."
