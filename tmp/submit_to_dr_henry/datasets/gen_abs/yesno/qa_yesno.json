As a result of alternative splicing, the total late mRNA population consists of about 5% mVP2 (no message body splice chosen), about 15% mVP3 (promoter-proximal 3' splice site chosen), and about 80% mVP1 (promoter-distal 3' splice site chosen). To determine whether it is splice site strength that determines the ratio of spliced products, constructs containing duplicated or rearranged 3' splice sites were created. In construct VP1,1, 160 bp surrounding the VP3 3' splice site was substituted with the corresponding region of the VP1 3' splice site. This construct resulted in the duplication of the VP1 3' splicing signal. VP3,3 (two identical VP3 3' splice sites) and VP1,3 (VP1 and VP3 3' splice sites reversed) were similarly created. Each construct maintained wild-type spacing between the 3' splice sites. Analysis of RNAs from transfections showed that in each construct, the 3' splice closest to the polyadenylation site was used preferentially. Analysis of a number of additional constructs indicated that there are no strong cis-acting positive or negative regulators of polyomavirus late splicing; rather, splicing choices appear to be determined largely by relative position of splice sites."

When malignant tumours develop distant metastatic lesions the new local tissue niche is known to impact on the biology of the cancer cells. However, little is known about how different metastatic tissue sites impact on frontline targeted therapies. Intriguingly, melanoma bone lesions have significantly lower response to BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapies. Here, we have investigated how the cellular niche of the bone can support melanoma cells by stimulating growth and survival via paracrine signalling between osteoblasts and cancer cells. Melanoma cells can enhance the differentiation of osteoblasts leading to increased production of secreted ligands, including RANKL. Differentiated osteoblasts in turn can support melanoma cell proliferation and survival via the secretion of RANKL that elevates the levels of the transcription factor MITF, even in the presence of BRAF inhibitor. By blocking RANKL signalling, either via neutralizing antibodies, genetic alterations or the RANKL receptor inhibitor SPD304, the survival advantage provided by osteoblasts could be overcome."

DNA methylation of LINE-1 and Alu repeats were analyzed using pyrosequencing in 61 invasive breast cancers. Median values observed for DNA methylation of LINE-1 and Alu repeats were considered as the cut-off (59.81 and 18.49%, respectively). The results of the current study demonstrated a positive correlation between DNA methylation levels of LINE-1 and Alu repeats (rho=0.284; P<0.03). DNA hypomethylation of LINE-1 was also indicated to be associated with low grade (P=0.023). To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first study regarding DNA methylation of LINE-1 and Alu repeats element in breast cancer of the Tunisian population. The results of the current study suggest that, since hypomethylation of LINE-1 is associated with low grade, it could be used as a biomarker for prognosis for patients with breast cancer."

Results indicate that height is\u00a0>\u00a02 SDS in infancy and childhood but in only half of affected adults. Cardinal facial characteristics include long, triangular face, macrocephaly, prominent forehead, everted lower lip, and prominent chin. Intellectual disability is universally present, behaviorally anxiety is characteristic. Malan syndrome is caused by deletions or point mutations of NFIX clustered mostly in exon 2. There is no genotype-phenotype correlation except for an increased risk for epilepsy with 19p13.2 microdeletions. Variants arose de novo, except in one family in which mother was mosaic. Variants causing Malan and Marshall-Smith syndrome can be discerned by differences in the site of stop codon formation. We conclude that Malan syndrome has a well recognizable phenotype that usually can be discerned easily from Marshall-Smith syndrome but rarely there is some overlap. Differentiation from Sotos and Weaver syndrome can be made by clinical evaluation only."

This, in turn suppressed HGF expression and the Met-mediated activation of the Akt pathway, as well as cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. In a cell line model where Met amplification has previously been shown to contribute to gefitinib resistance, Ran knockdown sensitized cells to gefitinib-mediated inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and consequently reduced cell proliferation. We further demonstrate that Met reduction-mediated by knockdown of Ran, occurs at the post-transcriptional level, probably via a matrix metalloproteinase. Moreover, the level of immunoreactive Ran and Met are positively associated in human breast cancer specimens, suggesting that a high level of Ran may be a pre-requisite for Met overexpression. Interestingly, a high level of immunoreactive Ran dictates the prognostic significance of Met, indicating that the co-overexpression of Met and Ran may be associated with cancer progression and could be used in combination as a prognostic indicator."

Approximately a quarter of all human protein-coding genes were overlapping genes. We observed different clusters of overlapping protein-coding genes, ranging from two genes (paired overlapping genes) to 22 genes. We also divided the paired overlapping protein-coding gene groups into four subtypes. We found that the divergent overlapping gene subtype had a stronger expression association than did the subtypes of 5'-tandem overlapping and 3'-tandem overlapping genes. The majority of paired overlapping genes exhibited comparable coincidental tissue expression profiles; however, a few overlapping gene pairs displayed distinctive tissue expression association patterns. In summary, we have carefully examined the genomic features and distributions about human overlapping protein-coding genes and found coincidental expression in tissues for most overlapping protein-coding genes."

Expression of the SLC26A4 gene may be responsible for iodide transport in the thyroid as well as for formation and function of the inner ear. Here, we analyzed the SLC26A4 gene and performed thyroid function tests (FT3, FT4, TSH, and Thyroglobulin) on six congenitally deaf infants (mean age 2.7 years) with EVA. Mutation of the SLC26A4 gene was identified in five patients: four were compound heterozygous (H723R/919-2A>G, H723R/IVS15+5G>A, H723R/R581S, IVS7-2A>G/IVS8+1G>A), the fifth had a frameshift mutation (322delC). All the patients demonstrated an elevation of serum thyroglobulin level. FT3 level was elevated in four of the five patients. The patient who did not have a detectable gene mutation showed normal thyroid function. We conclude that the mutations in the SLC26A4 gene identified here are highly associated with high serum thyroglobulin levels in congenital and deafness infants.

Although transcript usage quantitative trait loci (tuQTLs) have been mapped across multiple cell types and contexts, it is challenging to distinguish between the main molecular mechanisms controlling transcript usage: promoter choice, splicing and 3' end choice. Here, we analysed RNA-seq data from human macrophages exposed to three inflammatory and one metabolic stimulus. In addition to conventional gene-level and transcript-level analyses, we also directly quantified promoter usage, splicing and 3' end usage. We found that promoters, splicing and 3' ends were predominantly controlled by independent genetic variants enriched in distinct genomic features. Promoter usage QTLs were also 50% more likely to be context-specific than other tuQTLs and constituted 25% of the transcript-level colocalisations with complex traits. Thus, promoter usage might be an underappreciated molecular mechanism mediating complex trait associations in a context-specific manner."

Recently, targeted myocardial delivery of the GDF11 gene in aged mice was found to reduce heart failure and enhance the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). No investigations have as yet explored the cardioprotective effect of exogenous recombinant GDF11 in acute I-R injury, despite the convenience of its clinical application. We sought to determine whether exogenous recombinant GDF11 protects against acute myocardial I-R injury and investigate the underlying mechanism in Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that GDF11 reduced arrhythmia severity and successfully attenuated myocardial infarction; GDF11 also increased cardiac function after I-R, enhanced HO-1 expression and decreased oxidative damage. GDF11 activated the canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and inactivated the non-canonical pathways, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, administration of GDF11 prior to reperfusion protected the heart from reperfusion damage. Notably, pretreatment with the activin-binding protein, follistatin (FST), inhibited the cardioprotective effects of GDF11 by blocking its activation of Smad2/3 signaling and its inactivation of detrimental TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our data suggest that exogenous GDF11 has cardioprotective effects and may have morphologic and functional recovery in the early stage of myocardial I-R injury. GDF11 may be an innovative therapeutic approach for reducing myocardial I-R injury."

Wisdom may be defined as a complex human trait with several specific components: social decision making, emotion regulation, prosocial behaviors, self-reflection, acceptance of uncertainty, decisiveness, and spirituality. These components appear to be localized primarily to the prefrontal cortex and limbic striatum. Emerging research suggests that wisdom is linked to better overall health, well-being, happiness, life satisfaction, and resilience. Wisdom likely increases with age, facilitating a possible evolutionary role of wise grandparents in promoting the fitness of the species. Despite the loss of their own fertility and physical health, older adults help enhance their children's well-being, health, longevity, and fertility-the \"Grandma Hypothesis\" of wisdom. We propose a model of wisdom development that incorporates genetic, environmental, and evolutionary aspects. Wisdom has important implications at both individual and societal levels, and warrants further research as a major contributor to human thriving. There is a need for a greater emphasis on promoting wisdom through our educational systems from elementary to professional schools."

On account of their shared evolutionary ancestry, the replication machinery found in archaea is similar to that found in eukaryotes. DNA replication is initiated at origins and is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but our limited understanding of archaea has uncovered a wide diversity of replication initiation mechanisms. Archaeal origins are sequence-based, as in bacteria, but are bound by initiator proteins that share homology with the eukaryotic origin recognition complex subunit Orc1 and helicase loader Cdc6). Unlike bacteria, archaea may have multiple origins per chromosome and multiple Orc1/Cdc6 initiator proteins. There is no consensus on how these archaeal origins are recognised- some are bound by a single Orc1/Cdc6 protein while others require a multi- Orc1/Cdc6 complex. Many archaeal genomes consist of multiple parts-the main chromosome plus several megaplasmids-and in polyploid species these parts are present in multiple copies. This poses a challenge to the regulation of DNA replication. However, one archaeal species (Haloferax volcanii) can survive without replication origins; instead, it uses homologous recombination as an alternative mechanism of initiation. This diversity in DNA replication initiation is all the more remarkable for having been discovered in only three groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible."

Although it is mainly indicated in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and with no structural heart disease, it can be given in moderate stable cardiac disease as alternative to Amiodarone.

Evidence suggests that mice deficient in Tph2, the rate-limiting enzyme for brain serotonin synthesis, display disruptions in behavioral phenotypes relevant to stress-related psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to determine how maternal separation in wild-type, heterozygous, and Tph2 knockout mice affects mRNA expression of serotonin-related genes. Serotonergic genes studied included Tph2, the high-affinity, low-capacity, sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (Slc6a4), the serotonin type 1a receptor (Htr1a), and the corticosterone-sensitive, low-affinity, high-capacity sodium-independent serotonin transporter, organic cation transporter 3 (Slc22a3). Furthermore, we studied corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors 1 (Crhr1) and 2 (Crhr2), which play important roles in controlling serotonergic neuronal activity. For this study, offspring of Tph2 heterozygous dams were exposed to daily maternal separation for the first two weeks of life. Adult, male wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous offspring were subsequently used for molecular analysis. Maternal separation differentially altered serotonergic gene expression in a genotype- and topographically-specific manner. For example, maternal separation increased Slc6a4 mRNA expression in the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus in Tph2 heterozygous mice, but not in wild-type or knockout mice. Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that gene x environment interactions, including serotonergic genes and adverse early life experience, play an important role in vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders."

Germline variants in SDHB/C/D (SDHx) genes account for subsets of CS/CS-like cases, conferring a higher risk of breast and thyroid cancers over those with only germline PTEN mutations. To investigate whether SDHx alterations at both germline and somatic levels occur in apparently sporadic breast cancer and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), we analyzed SDHx genes in the following four groups: i) 48 individuals with sporadic invasive breast adenocarcinoma for germline mutation; ii) 48 (expanded to 241) DTC for germline mutation; iii) 37 pairs DTC tumor-normal tissues for germline and somatic mutation and mRNA expression levels; and iv) data from 476 patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas thyroid carcinoma dataset for validation. No germline SDHx variant was found in a pilot series of 48 breast cancer cases. As germline SDHx variants were found in our pilot of 48 thyroid cancer cases, we expanded to three series of DTC comprising a total 754 cases, and found 48 (6%) with germline SDHx variants (P<0.001 compared with 0/350 controls). In 513 tumors, we found 27 (5%) with large somatic duplications within chromosome 1 encompassing SDHC. Both papillary and follicular thyroid tumors showed consistent loss of SDHC/D gene expression (P<0.001), which is associated with earlier disease onset and higher pathological-TNM stage. Therefore, we conclude that both germline and somatic SDHx mutations/variants occur in sporadic DTC but are very rare in sporadic breast cancer, and overall loss of SDHx gene expression is a signature of DTC.

The aim of this study was to explore whether histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) can serve as a therapeutic target focusing on the mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS/GARS)-induced peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia from the C201R mutant Gars mouse model showed reduced acetylated \u03b1-tubulin levels. In primary dorsal root ganglion neurons, mutant GlyRS affected neurite length and disrupted normal mitochondrial transport. We demonstrated that GlyRS co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC6 and that this interaction was blocked by tubastatin A, a selective inhibitor of the deacetylating function of HDAC6. Moreover, HDAC6 inhibition restored mitochondrial axonal transport in mutant GlyRS-expressing neurons. Systemic delivery of a specific HDAC6 inhibitor increased \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in peripheral nerves and partially restored nerve conduction and motor behaviour in mutant Gars mice. Our study demonstrates that \u03b1-tubulin deacetylation and disrupted axonal transport may represent a common pathogenic mechanism underlying Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and it broadens the therapeutic potential of selective HDAC6 inhibition to other genetic forms of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."

Because compound osteoactivity is mostly determined in zebrafish through the morphometric analysis of bone structures, image analysis, rather than screening assay implementation, molecule availability and image acquisition, represents a bottleneck to the screening throughput. The absence of auto/semi-automatic tools for image analysis of fish bone structures is also a limitation to a broader usage of zebrafish screening pipelines. We present here ZFBONE (for ZEbrafish BONE), an open-source, freely available, user-friendly, rapid and reliable toolset, aiming at accelerating image analysis by automating the morphometric assessment of zebrafish bone structures, but also at increasing data accuracy by reducing operator bias. Tools included in ZFBONE allow users to assess, from 2D images, morphometric parameters of several bone structures (e.g. operculum, caudal fin rays and scales) but also the extent and the intensity of bone-specific colorations. ZFBONE has been developed using the open-source ImageJ software, to make it available to the whole zebrafish research community, but also to have it easily modifiable according to user demands.

Hemorrhagic pericarditis is known to occur with rivaroxaban; however, only a few case reports in the literature describe such events. Recently, we experienced hemorrhagic pericarditis that treated with rivaroxaban for anticoagulation of newly diagnosed, non valvular AF patients with pacemaker. An 83 year old male with permanent pacemaker receiving rivaroxaban 20 mg daily once for 3 months presented at our emergency department complaining of exertional dyspnea. ECG showed intermittent atrial pacing failure and echocardiography showed large amount of pericardial effusion. After urgent pericardiocentesis, which resulted in removal of 500cc bloody fluid, there was an immediate and dramatic improvement in the patient's clinical state. He was discharged without anticoagulation therapy due to concern for further bleeding. This case highlight the potential for bleeding complications associated with novel anticoagulants. Rivaroxaban is being used with increasing frequently in outpatient care. However, no available laboratory test specifically measures the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban. Also, in the events of serious bleeding, no specific antidotes, reversal agents were available. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of hemopericardium in patients treated with anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban who presented with cardiomegaly."

UPR is mediated by three main sensors, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6\u03b1 (ATF6\u03b1), and inositol-requiring enzyme-1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1). Given that proteostasis is frequently disregulated in cancer, UPR is emerging as a critical signaling network in controlling the survival, selection, and adaptation of a variety of neoplasias, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma. Indeed, cancer cells can escape from the apoptotic pathways elicited by ER stress by switching UPR into a prosurvival mechanism instead of cell death. Although most of the studies on UPR focused on solid tumors, this intricate network plays a critical role in hematological malignancies, and especially in multiple myeloma (MM), where treatment with proteasome inhibitors induce the accumulation of unfolded proteins that severely perturb proteostasis, thereby leading to ER stress, and, eventually, to apoptosis. However, UPR is emerging as a key player also in acute leukemias, where recent evidence points to the likelihood that targeting UPR-driven prosurvival pathways could represent a novel therapeutic strategy. In this review, we focus on the oncogene-specific regulation of individual UPR signaling arms, and we provide an updated outline of the genetic, biochemical, and preclinical therapeutic findings that support UPR as a relevant, novel target in acute leukemias."

Three gene variant genotypes were examined in young Japanese women (n\u200a=\u200a231).

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of the total protein S activity/total protein S antigen ratio for identifying protein S Tokushima heterozygotes with that of the clot-based protein S activity/free protein S antigen ratio and found that sensitivity and specificity of 100% each was only achieved by the former.

The aims of present study were to screen critical genes with tubulointerstitial lesion in CKD by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression data including 169 tubulointerstitial samples of CKD and 21 controls downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Totally 294 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened, including 180 upregulated and 114 downregulated genes. Meanwhile, 90 expression data of tubulointerstitial samples combined with clinic information were applied to explore the potential mechanisms of tubulointerstitial lesion. As a consequence, the blue, brown and yellow modules which included the most DEGs compared to the other modules and exhibited strongly association with eGFR, were significantly enriched in several signalling pathways that have been reported involved in pathogenesis of CKD. Furthermore, it was found that the four genes (PLG, ITGB2, CTSS and CCL5) was one of the DEGs which also be identified as hub genes according to Kwithin. Finally, the Nephroseq online tool showed that the tubulointerstitial expression levels of PLG significantly positively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), while ITGB2, CTSS and CCL5 connected negatively to the eGFR of CKD patients. Taken together, WGCNA is an efficient approach to system biology. By this procedure, the present study enhanced the understanding of the transcriptome status of CKD and might shed a light on the further investigation on the mechanisms of renal tubulointerstitial injury in CKD. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY: Traditional molecular biology can only explain the local part of the biological system, and difficult to make comprehensive exploration of the whole biological system in the chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we gave an explicit elucidation of dysregulated protein coding genes by the analysis of microarray datasets in GEO database. We have presented a novel approach using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to explore the DEGs which implicated in CKD process. In this study, we conducted WGCNA to explore the potential mechanisms of renal tubular damage, and provided novel biomarkers associated with the molecular mechanisms underlying renal tubulointerstitial injury in CKD."

This type of non-sequence variation is called epigenetics. The enzymes responsible for generation of such DNA modifications in mammals are named DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) including DNMT1, DNMT2 and DNMT3. The later stages of oxidations to these modifications are catalyzed by Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins, which contain catalytic domains belonging to the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family. In various mammalian cells/tissues including embryonic stem cells, cancer cells and brain tissues, it has been confirmed that these proteins are able to induce the stepwise oxidization of 5-methyl cytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and finally 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Each stage from initial methylation until the end of the DNA demethylation process is considered as a specific epigenetic mark that may regulate gene expression. This review discusses controversial evidence for the presence of such oxidative products, particularly 5hmC, in various plant species. Whereas some reports suggest no evidence for enzymatic DNA demethylation, other reports suggest that the presence of oxidative products is followed by the active demethylation and indicate the contribution of possible TET-like proteins in the regulation of gene expression in plants. The review also summarizes the results obtained by expressing the human TET conserved catalytic domain in transgenic plants."

The major trials in community-dwelling individuals have not demonstrated fracture prevention with either calcium, vitamin D, or their combination, but the results of a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents indicated a reduced fracture incidence. Trials show that vitamin D increases bone density when winter 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are below 25-30\u00a0nmol/L. However, assay expense and variability suggest that supplements are better targeted based on clinical status to frail older people and possibly to people with dark skin living at higher latitudes. A daily dose of 400-800 units (10-20\u00a0\u03bcg) is usually adequate. Parenteral antiresorptive drugs can cause hypocalcaemia in severe vitamin D deficiency (<\u00a025\u00a0nmol/L), which should therefore be corrected before treatment. Clinical trials have not demonstrated benefits of vitamin D on non-skeletal endpoints. Calcium supplements in healthy individuals are not needed, nor are they required in most people receiving treatment for osteoporosis, where they have not been shown to affect treatment efficacy. Calcium supplements cause constipation, bloating and kidney stones, and some evidence suggests they may cause a small increase in the risk of myocardial infarction. Low dose vitamin D is safe, but high doses result in more falls and fractures. Current evidence does not support the use of these supplements in healthy community-dwelling adults."

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were \u226560 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS In patients \u226560 years in a primary healthcare setting, multimorbidity predictors of pre-frailty and frailty included a decline in cognitive function and renal function."

To induce the colitis model, mice continuously consumed water containing 3% DSS for 7 days; some mice were also treated with Sal and the SIRT1/FoxOs pathway blocker selisistat (Ex527). Changes in body weight, DAI, colon length and colon tissue histology as well as SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities were measured. The expression of SIRT1, FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4, caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 in colorectal tissues was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The study showed that Sal decreased the DAI score, weight loss, colon shortening and colon tissue damage in colitis mice. Sal inhibited oxidative stress by upregulating SOD, GSH-Px and CAT while suppressing colonic apoptosis by downregulating the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3 and upregulating the expression of Bcl-2. Sal also activated SIRT1/FoxOs signaling, which increased the expression of SIRT1, FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO4 in colon tissue.

By comparing whole-cell proteome analysis of developed (cAMP-pulsed) wild-type AX2 cells and an independent transcriptomic analysis of developed wild-type AX4 cells, our results show that up to 70% of the identified proteins overlap in the two independent studies. Among them, we have found 26 proteins previously related to cAMP signaling and identified 110 novel proteins involved in calcium signaling, adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, metabolism, and proteins that previously lacked any annotation. Our study validates previous findings, mostly for the canonical cAMP-pathway, and also generates further insight into the complexity of the transcriptomic changes during early development. This article also compares proteomic data between parental and cells lacking glkA, a GSK-3 kinase implicated in substrate adhesion and chemotaxis in Dictyostelium.

Here, we report on a novel microfluidic chip fabrication procedure that combines straightforward production of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips with a reduced UV fluorescence background (83%-reduction) by using PDMS droplets with carbon black pigments (CBP) as additives. The CBP-droplet is placed at the point of detection, whereas the rest of the chip remains transparent, ensuring full optical control of the chip. We systematically studied the relation of the UV background fluorescence at CBP to PDMS ratios (varying from 1:10 to 1:1000) for different UV laser powers. Using a CBP/PDMS ratio of 1:20, detection of a 100\u2009nM tryptophan solution (S/N\u2009=\u20093.5) was possible, providing a theoretical limit of detection of 86\u2009nM (with S/N\u2009=\u20093). Via simultaneous two color UV/VIS-LIF detection, we were able to demonstrate the electrophoretic separation of an analyte mixture of 500\u2009nM tryptophan (UV) and 5\u2009nM fluorescein (VIS) within 30\u2009s. As an application, two color LIF detection was also used for the electrophoretic separation of the protein content from a GFP-labeled single Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell. Thereby just one single peak could be measured in the visible spectral range that could be correlated with one single peak among others in the ultraviolet spectra. This indicates an identification of the labeled protein \u03b3-PKC and envisions a further feasible identification of more than one single protein in the future."

RNA sequencing demonstrated marked transcriptional differences between resident and recruited AMs affecting three main areas: proliferation, inflammatory signaling, and metabolism. Functional assays and metabolomic studies confirmed these differences and demonstrated that resident AMs proliferate locally and are governed by increased tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism. Conversely, recruited AMs produce inflammatory cytokines in association with increased glycolytic and arginine metabolism. Collectively, the data show that even though they coexist in the same environment, inflammatory macrophage subsets have distinct immunometabolic programs and perform specialized functions during inflammation that are associated with their cellular origin."

Ospemifene has estrogen-like effects on the vaginal epithelium, and is indicated to treat moderate-to-severe symptomatic VVA (Europe) or moderate-to-severe symptomatic dyspareunia and vaginal dryness (United States) in postmenopausal women. The case studies presented in this article follow the progress of two women who began treatment with ospemifene for the main presenting symptom of dyspareunia. Both women had concerns about the impact of their symptomatology on new relationships. The patient in case 1 experienced relevant improvement within 3 months of treatment start and, by 1 year, dyspareunia was absent. Vaginal lubricants were no longer required. The patient in case 2 experienced relevant improvement within 4 weeks of starting ospemifene. At 15 months, with the use of a lubricant for vaginal penetration, she could enjoy sexual intercourse without pain. At the time of writing, she had been receiving ospemifene continuously for more than 2 years with effective symptom relief and good tolerability."

A recent article in this journal documented potential gene variants involved in long-segment Hirschsprung disease in 23 patients. Gene variants were identified using a 31-gene panel of genes related to Hirschsprung disease or enteric neural crest cell development, as previously reported in the literature. The study identified potentially harmful variants in eight genes across 13 patients, with a detection rate of 56.5% (13/23 patients). Five patients had pathologic variants in RET, NRG1, and L1CAM, and the remainder were considered variants of unknown significance. The authors attempted prenatal diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease utilizing an amniocentesis sample obtained for advanced maternal age in a family with a known deleterious RET mutation, manifested in the father (long-segment Hirschsprung disease) and older daughter (total colonic aganglionosis). The fetus had the same RET variant but, after several years of follow-up, has not developed any symptoms of Hirschsprung disease, supporting the conclusion that this RET mutation is an autosomal dominant gene with incomplete penetrance. This experience suggests that genetic counseling is appropriate to carefully assess the justification of prenatal testing, especially, when the phenotype of long-segment Hirschsprung disease is so variable and the disease is potentially curable with surgery."

Previous knowledge of the amount and distribution of these aspects in the general Swedish population, as well as the fulfilment rate of physical activity recommendations, mainly relies on self-reported data. More detailed data assessed with objective methods is needed. The aim of the study was to present descriptive data on the daily movement pattern in a middle-aged Swedish population assessed by hip-worn accelerometers. The cohort consisted of 948 participants (51% women), aged 50 to 64 years, from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage pilot Study. In the total sample, 60.5% of accelerometer wear time was spent sitting, 35.2% in light physical activity and 3.9% in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Men and participants with high educational level spent a larger proportion of time sitting, compared to women and participants with low educational level. Men and participants with a high educational level spent more time, and the oldest age-group spent less time, in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Only 7.1% of the study population met the current national physical activity recommendations, with no gender, age or education level differences. Assessment of all three components of the daily movement pattern is of high clinical relevance and should be included in future research. As the fulfilment of national physical activity recommendations is very low and sitting time is very high in our middle-aged population, the great challenge remains to enhance the implementation of methods to increase the level of physical activity in this population."

Cyclophilins possess a hydrophobic pocket where proline-containing peptide substrates and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A bind. In this study, we engineered five CyPA mutations, each of which alters a residue that contributes to the hydrophobic pocket. Compared with the wild-type protein, all of the mutants drastically reduced CyPA binding to HIV-1 Gag and similarly inhibited CyPA incorporation into virions. In addition, we demonstrated that previously reported differences between the Gag-binding properties of CyPA and CyPB are due to adventitious association involving residues in the signal sequence of CyPB and that the core domain of CyPB interacts with Gag in a fashion which is indistinguishable from that of CyPA. These studies indicate that, as with other proline-containing peptides or cyclosporine A, HIV-1 Gag directly contacts residues in the hydrophobic pocket of CyPA."

Cells overexpressing the SET deletion mutant caused a delay in fork restart after HU release. Our In vitro study revealed that the SET domain but not the H3K36me2 activity is required for the 5' end of ss-overhang cleavage with fork and non-fork DNA without affecting the Metnase-DNA interaction. Together, our results suggest that the Metnase SET domain has a positive role in restart of replication fork and the 5' end of ss-overhang cleavage, providing a new insight into the functional interaction of the SET and the transposase domains.

SWR1-catalyzed H2A.Z replacement in vitro occurs in a stepwise and unidirectional fashion, one H2A.Z-H2B dimer at a time, producing heterotypic nucleosomes as intermediates and homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes as end products. The ATPase activity of SWR1 is specifically stimulated by H2A-containing nucleosomes without ensuing histone H2A eviction. Remarkably, further addition of free H2A.Z-H2B dimer leads to hyperstimulation of ATPase activity, eviction of nucleosomal H2A-H2B, and deposition of H2A.Z-H2B.

These cells were refractory to sorafenib-induced cell death. We report that sorafenib-resistant cells had lower levels of total and phosphorylated AMPK as well as its downstream substrate, ACC, compared with the parental cells. Interestingly, AMPK knockdown with siRNA or inhibition with dorsomorphin increased the expression of stem cell markers in parental cells and blocked sorafenib-induced cell death. Conversely, the upregulation of AMPK, either by transfection or by pharmacological activation with A-769662, decreased the expression of ALDH1A1, ABCB1A, CD133, Nanog, Oct4, and alpha fetoprotein, and restored sensitivity to sorafenib. Analysis of the underlying mechanism points to hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1\u03b1 as a regulator of stemness. In\u00a0vivo studies in a xenograft mouse model demonstrated that stem-like cells have greater tumourigenic capacity. AMPK activation reduced xenograft tumour growth and decreased the expression of stem cell markers. Taken together, these results indicate that AMPK may serve as a novel target to overcome chemoresistance in HCC."

Tolerance of high copper by fungi makes toxicity as a defense mechanism largely ineffective against fungal pathogens. A forward genetic screen for Histoplasma capsulatum mutant yeasts unable to replicate within macrophages showed the Ctr3 copper transporter is required for intramacrophage proliferation. Ctr3 mediates copper uptake and is required for growth in low copper. Transcription of the CTR3 gene is induced by differentiation of H. capsulatum into pathogenic yeasts and by low available copper, but not decreased iron. Low expression of a CTR3 transcriptional reporter by intracellular yeasts implies that phagosomes of non-activated macrophages have moderate copper levels. This is further supported by the replication of Ctr3-deficient yeasts within the phagosome of non-activated macrophages. However, IFN-\u03b3 activation of phagocytes causes restriction of phagosomal copper as shown by upregulation of the CTR3 transcriptional reporter and by the failure of Ctr3-deficient yeasts, but not Ctr3 expressing yeasts, to proliferate within these macrophages. Accordingly, in a respiratory model of histoplasmosis, Ctr3-deficient yeasts are fully virulent during phases of the innate immune response but are attenuated after the onset of adaptive immunity. Thus, while technical limitations prevent direct measurement of phagosomal copper concentrations and copper-independent factors can influence gene expression, both the CTR3 promoter induction and the attenuation of Ctr3-deficient yeasts indicate activation of macrophages switches the phagosome from a copper-replete to a copper-depleted environment, forcing H. capsulatum reliance on Ctr3 for copper acquisition."

Since TERT promoter mutations and ATRX alterations have been shown to be associated with prognosis, we analyzed whether these tumor markers provide additional prognostic information within each of the five WHO 2016 categories. We used data for 1206 patients from the UCSF Adult Glioma Study, the Mayo Clinic and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with infiltrative glioma, grades II-IV for whom tumor status for IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, ATRX, and TERT had been determined. All cases were assigned to one of 5 groups following the WHO 2016 diagnostic criteria based on their morphologic features, and IDH and 1p/19q codeletion status. These groups are: (1) Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted; (2) Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant; (3) Glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; (4) Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; and (5) Astrocytoma, IDH-wildtype. Within each group, we used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations of overall survival with patient age at diagnosis, grade, and ATRX alteration status and/or TERT promoter mutation status. Among Group 1 IDH-mutant 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas, the TERT-WT group had significantly worse overall survival than the TERT-MUT group (HR: 2.72, 95% CI 1.05-7.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In both Group 2, IDH-mutant astrocytomas and Group 3, IDH-mutant glioblastomas, neither TERT mutations nor ATRX alterations were significantly associated with survival. Among Group 4, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, ATRX alterations were associated with favorable outcomes (HR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.81, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Among Group 5, IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, the TERT-WT group had significantly better overall survival than the TERT-MUT group (HR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.87), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of A\u03b2 plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the direct interaction of this antibody with synaptotoxic soluble A\u03b2 species. In the current report, we demonstrated that 3D6 binds to soluble, synaptotoxic assemblies of A\u03b2(1-42) and prevents multiple downstream functional consequences in rat hippocampal neurons including changes in glutamate AMPA receptor trafficking, AD-type tau phosphorylation, and loss of dendritic spines. In vivo, we further demonstrated that 3D6 prevents synaptic loss and acutely reverses the behavioral deficit in the contextual fear conditioning task in transgenic mouse models of AD, two endpoints thought to be linked to synaptotoxic soluble A\u03b2 moieties. Importantly C-terminal anti-A\u03b2 antibodies were ineffective on these endpoints. These results, taken with prior studies, suggest that N-terminal anti-A\u03b2 antibodies effectively interact with both soluble and insoluble forms of A\u03b2 and therefore appear particularly well suited for testing the A\u03b2 hypothesis of AD."

More detailed data assessed with objective methods is needed. The aim of the study was to present descriptive data on the daily movement pattern in a middle-aged Swedish population assessed by hip-worn accelerometers. The cohort consisted of 948 participants (51% women), aged 50 to 64 years, from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage pilot Study. In the total sample, 60.5% of accelerometer wear time was spent sitting, 35.2% in light physical activity and 3.9% in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Men and participants with high educational level spent a larger proportion of time sitting, compared to women and participants with low educational level. Men and participants with a high educational level spent more time, and the oldest age-group spent less time, in moderate- and vigorous physical activity. Only 7.1% of the study population met the current national physical activity recommendations, with no gender, age or education level differences. Assessment of all three components of the daily movement pattern is of high clinical relevance and should be included in future research. As the fulfilment of national physical activity recommendations is very low and sitting time is very high in our middle-aged population, the great challenge remains to enhance the implementation of methods to increase the level of physical activity in this population."

This process is highly complex and primarily involves several key steps, including stimulation of endothelial cells by growth factors, degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, and capillary tube formation. Currently, it is considered that multiple cytokines play a vital role in this process, which consist of proangiogenic factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, and angiopoietins) and antiangiogenic factors (e.g., endostatin, thrombospondin, and angiostatin). Angiogenesis is essential for most physiological events, such as body growth and development, tissue repair, and wound healing. However, uncontrolled neovascularization may contribute to angiogenic disorders. In physiological conditions, the above promoters and inhibitors function in a coordinated way to induce and sustain angiogenesis within a limited period of time. Conversely, the imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors could cause pathological angiogenesis and trigger several diseases. With insights into the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis, increasing reports have shown that a close relationship exists between angiogenesis and oxidative stress (OS) in both physiological and pathological conditions. OS, an imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant systems, is a cause and consequence of many vascular complains and serves as one of the biomarkers for these diseases. Furthermore, emerging evidence supports that OS and angiogenesis play vital roles in many dermatoses, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and skin tumor. This review summarizes recent findings on the role of OS as a trigger of angiogenesis in skin disorders, highlights newly identified mechanisms, and introduces the antiangiogenic and antioxidant therapeutic strategies."

Linker histones are DNA packaging proteins with established roles in chromatin compaction, gene transcription, and in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. Using a machine-learning model for functional prioritization of eukaryotic post-translational modifications (PTMs) in combination with genetic and biochemical experiments with the yeast linker histone, Hho1, we discovered that site-specific phosphorylation sites regulate HR and HR-mediated DSB repair. Five total sites were investigated (T10, S65, S141, S173, and S174), ranging from high to low function potential as determined by the model. Of these, we confirmed S173/174 are phosphorylated in yeast by mass spectrometry and found no evidence of phosphorylation at the other sites. Phospho-nullifying mutations at these two sites results in a significant decrease in HR-mediated DSB repair templated either with oligonucleotides or a homologous chromosome, while phospho-mimicing mutations have no effect. S65, corresponding to a mammalian phosphosite that is conserved in yeast, exhibited similar effects. None of the mutations affected base- or nucleotide-excision repair, nor did they disrupt non-homologous end joining or RNA-mediated repair of DSBs when sequence heterology between the break and repair template strands was low. More extensive analysis of the S174 phospho-null mutant revealed that its repression of HR and DSB repair is proportional to the degree of sequence heterology between DSB ends and the HR repair template. Taken together, these data demonstrate the utility of machine learning for the discovery of functional PTM hotspots, reveal linker histone phosphorylation sites necessary for HR and HR-mediated DSB repair, and provide insight into the context-dependent control of DNA integrity by the yeast linker histone Hho1."

Inverted repeat Alus (IRAlus) negatively regulate splicing of long introns within SMN, while promoting widespread alternative circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of ultra-conserved Sam68 binding sites in SMN IRAlus. Cross-link-immunoprecipitation (CLIP), mutagenesis and silencing experiments showed that Sam68 binds in proximity of intronic Alus in the SMN pre-mRNA, thus favouring circRNA biogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

However, patients often evolve into acquired resistance. The secondary mutations in EGFR account for nearly half of the acquired resistance. While the remaining 50% of patients exhibit tolerance to EGFR-TKIs with unclear mechanism(s). Cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitinase, functions as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell apoptosis, proliferation, and immune response, and so on. The role of CYLD in NSCLC EGFR-TKI resistance remains elusive. Here, we found CYLD was upregulated in PC-9 cells, whereas downregulated in PC-9 acquired gefitinib-resistant (PC-9/GR) cells in response to the treatment of gefitinib, which is consistent with the results in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Overexpression of CYLD promoted a more apoptotic death ratio in PC-9/GR cells than that in PC-9 cells. In addition, silencing the expression of CYLD resulted in an increase of the expression level of interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, which may contribute to acquired resistance of PC-9 cells to gefitinib. Taken together, our data in vitro demonstrate that PC-9/GR cells downregulated CYLD expression, enhanced subsequent CYLD-dependent antiapoptotic capacity and inflammatory response, which may provide a possible target for acquired gefitinib-resistant treatment in NSCLC."

Transcriptional activation of many TLR-responsive genes requires an initial de-repression step in which nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complexes are actively removed from the promoters of target genes to relieve basal repression. Ligand-dependent SUMOylation of liver X receptors (LXRs) has been found to suppress TLR4-induced transcription potently by preventing the NCoR clearance step, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we provide evidence that coronin 2A (CORO2A), a component of the NCoR complex of previously unknown function, mediates TLR-induced NCoR turnover by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin. SUMOylated LXRs block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO2/SUMO3-interaction motif in CORO2A and preventing actin recruitment. Intriguingly, the LXR transrepression pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u03b3 (CaMKII\u03b3)-dependent phosphorylation of LXRs, leading to their deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP3 and release from CORO2A. These findings uncover a CORO2A-actin-dependent mechanism for the de-repression of inflammatory response genes that can be differentially regulated by phosphorylation and by nuclear receptor signalling pathways that control immunity and homeostasis."

Sensitive detection and specific capture methods are essential for exosomes analysis. Herein, a dual functional platform composed of superparamagnetic conjunctions and molecular beacons (SMC-MB) is reported. The SMC-MB platform is designed based on aptamer immunoaffinity with ultrasensitive detection efficiency and reversible isolation capacity, which, respectively, profit from nonenzymatic amplification methods and magnetic separation along with restriction cleavage. It is noteworthy that exosomes quantification was exactly amplified and transformed into single strand DNA detection. Correlated measurements evidence that the limit of detection of SMC-MB is as low as \u223c100 particles/\u03bcL in urine, and a linear relationship meets between the logarithmic concentration of exosomes and fluorescence intensity of the molecular beacon. Furthermore, employing prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) aptamer, the platform adapted to detect and capture PMSA-positive exosomes from urine samples provides excellent diagnostic efficiency for prostate cancer (PCa). The expression of typical biomarkers of PCa, i.e., PSA and PCA3 mRNA, is significantly higher in PSMA-positive exosomes. Altogether, the platform and strategy described in this paper are promising in urinary exosomes analysis and prostate cancer detection."

HO-1 expression is mainly governed by a mutual interplay between the transcriptional factor NRF2 and the nuclear repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1), a heme sensor protein. In the current study we hypothesized that alterations in the levels of intracellular labile heme in macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypical pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 agonist, are responsible for BACH1-dependent HO-1 expression. To this end, labile heme was determined in both mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) using an apo-horseradish peroxidase-based assay. We found that LPS raised the levels of labile heme, depressed BACH1 protein and up-regulated HO-1 in mBMDMs. In contrast, in hMDMs LPS decreased labile heme levels while increasing BACH1 expression and down-regulating HO-1. These effects were abolished by the TLR4 antagonist TAK-242, suggesting that TLR4 activation triggers the signaling cascade leading to changes in the labile heme pool. Studies using mBMDMs from BACH1-/- and NRF2-/- mice revealed that regulation of HO-1 and levels of labile heme after LPS stimulation are strictly dependent on BACH1, but not NRF2. A strong interplay between BACH1-mediated HO-1 expression and intracellular levels of labile heme was also confirmed in hMDMs with siRNA knockdown studies and following inhibition of de novo heme synthesis with succinylacetone. Finally, CORM-401, a compound that liberates CO, counteracted LPS-dependent down-regulation of HO-1 and restored levels of labile heme in hMDMs. In conclusion, alterations of labile heme levels in macrophages following TLR4 stimulation play a crucial role in BACH1-mediated regulation of HO-1 expression."

In alpha-NAGA deficiency, there are discrepancies between the genotype and phenotype, and also between urinary excretion products (sialyl glycoconjugates) and a theoretical accumulated material (Tn-antigen; Gal NAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr) resulting from a defect in alpha-NAGA. As for the former issue, previously reported genetic, biochemical and pathological data raise the question whether or not E325K mutation found in Schindler disease patients really leads to the severe phenotype of alpha-NAGA deficiency. The latter issue leads to the question of whether alpha-NAGA deficiency is associated with the basic pathogenesis of this disease. To clarify the pathogenesis of this disease, we performed structural and immunocytochemical studies. The structure of human alpha-NAGA deduced on homology modeling is composed of two domains, domain I, including the active site, and domain II. R329W/Q, identified in patients with Kanzaki disease have been deduced to cause drastic changes at the interface between domains I and II. The structural change caused by E325K found in patients with Schindler disease is localized on the N-terminal side of the tenth beta-strand in domain II and is smaller than those caused by R329W/Q. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the main lysosomal accumulated material in cultured fibroblasts from patients with Kanzaki disease is Tn-antigen. These data suggest that a prototype of alpha-NAGA deficiency in Kanzaki disease and factors other than the defect of alpha-NAGA may contribute to severe neurological disorders, and Kanzaki disease is thought to be caused by a single enzyme deficiency."

These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology. "

                    "context": "Ziconotide is a conopeptide intrathecal (IT) analgesic which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of severe chronic pain. It is a synthetic equivalent of a naturally occurring conopeptide found in the venom of the fish-eating marine cone snail and provides analgesia via binding to N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the spinal cord. As ziconotide is a peptide, it is expected to be completely degraded by endopeptidases and exopeptidases (Phase I hydrolytic enzymes) widely located throughout the body, and not by other Phase I biotransformation processes (including the cytochrome P450 system) or by Phase II conjugation reactions. Thus, IT administration, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, and metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases make metabolic interactions of other drugs with ziconotide unlikely. Side effects of ziconotide which tend to occur more commonly at higher doses may include: nausea, vomiting, confusion, postural hypotension, abnormal gait, urinary retention, nystagmus/amblyopia, drowsiness/somnolence (reduced level of consciousness), dizziness or lightheadedness, weakness, visual problems (eg, double vision), elevation of serum creatine kinase, or vestibular side effects. Initially, when ziconotide was first administered to human subjects, titration schedules were overly aggressive and led to an abundance of adverse effects. Subsequently, clinicians have gained appreciation for ziconotide's relatively narrow therapeutic window. With appropriate usage multiple studies have shown ziconotide to be a safe and effective intrathecal analgesic alone or in combination with other intrathecal analgesics."

In this study, we found that CKAP4 interacts with \u03b21 integrin and controls the recycling of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin independently of DKK1. In S2-CP8 cells, knockdown of CKAP4 but not DKK1 enlarged the size of cell adhesion sites and enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin, resulting in decreased cell migration. When CKAP4 was depleted, the levels of \u03b15 but not \u03b21 integrin were increased in the cell surface membrane. A similar phenotype was observed in other cells expressing low levels of DKK1. In S2-CP8 cells, \u03b15 integrin was trafficked with \u03b21 integrin and CKAP4 to the lysosome or recycled with \u03b21 integrin. In CKAP4-depleted cells, the internalization of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin was unchanged, but its recycling was upregulated. Knockdown of sorting nexin 17 (SNX17), a mediator of integrin recycling, abrogated the increased \u03b15 integrin levels caused by CKAP4 knockdown. CKAP4 bound to SNX17, and its knockdown enhanced the recruitment of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin to SNX17. These results suggest that CKAP4 suppresses the recycling of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin and coordinates cell adhesion sites and migration independently of DKK1."

Our group has generated bicistronic genes in which classical TALEN coding sequences are linked by 2A elements to different reporter molecules, such as fluorochromes (TALEN-F) or membrane receptors (TALEN-M). This structure results in two proteins transcribed from the same transcript, of which the second (the reporter) can be used as the target for selection by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The application of these new TALEN genes allows a rapid enrichment of cells in which both members of the TALEN pair are active, thus eliminating the need for lengthy selection in culture and laborious characterization of a large number of clones. \u00a9 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Combinatorial phage-peptide libraries were used to select 12 amino acid polypeptide aptamers toward anterior gradient-2 to determine whether methods can be developed to affinity purify the protein from clinical biopsies. Selecting phage aptamers through four rounds of screening on recombinant human anterior gradient-2 protein identified two classes of peptide ligand that bind to distinct epitopes on anterior gradient-2 protein in an immunoblot. Synthetic biotinylated peptide aptamers bound in an ELISA format to anterior gradient-2, and substitution mutagenesis further minimized one polypeptide aptamer to a hexapeptide core. Aptamers containing this latter consensus sequence could be used to affinity purify to homogeneity human anterior gradient-2 protein from a single clinical biopsy. The spotting of a panel of peptide aptamers onto a protein microarray matrix could be used to quantify anterior gradient-2 protein from crude clinical biopsy lysates, providing a format for quantitative screening. These data highlight the utility of peptide combinatorial libraries to acquire rapidly a high-affinity ligand that can selectively bind a target protein from a clinical biopsy and provide a technological approach for clinical biomarker assay development in an aptamer microarray format."

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that palmitoylation or S-acylation, the post-translational modification of cysteines with saturated fatty acids, plays instrumental roles in regulating the localization, activity, stability, sorting, and function of numerous proteins, including proteins known to have essential functions in cardiomyocytes. However, the impact of this modification on cardiac physiology requires further investigation. S-acylation is catalyzed by the zDHHC family of S-acyl transferases that localize to intracellular organelle membranes or the sarcolemma. Recent work has begun to uncover functions of S-acylation in the heart, particularly in the regulation of cardiac electrophysiology, including modification of the sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholemman and the cardiac sodium pump, as well as the voltage-gated sodium channel. Elucidating the regulatory functions of zDHHC enzymes in cardiomyocytes and determination of how S-acylation is altered in the diseased heart will shed light on how these modifications participate in cardiac pathogenesis and potentially identify novel targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Indeed, proteins with critical signaling roles in the heart are also S-acylated, including receptors and G-proteins, yet the dynamics and functions of these modifications in myocardial physiology have not been interrogated. Here, we will review what is known about zDHHC enzymes and substrate S-acylation in myocardial physiology and highlight future areas of investigation that will uncover novel functions of S-acylation in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology."

All of them had developed substantial weight gain following treatment with a second-generation antipsychotic. The centralized, computer-based randomization system assigned participants to unmasked treatment groups: metformin (MET); antipsychotic switch (aripiprazole or, if already exposed to that drug, perphenazine or molindone; SWITCH); or continued baseline antipsychotic (CONTROL). All participants received healthy lifestyle education. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) z-score change from baseline, analyzed using estimated least squares means. Altogether, 127 participants were randomized: 49 to MET, 31 to SWITCH, and 47 to CONTROL. BMI z-score decreased significantly with MET (week 24: -0.09\u00b10.03, p=0.002) and SWITCH (week 24: -0.11\u00b10.04, p=0.003), while it increased non-significantly with CONTROL (week 24: +0.04\u00b10.03). On 3-way comparison, BMI z-score changes differed significantly (p=0.001). MET and SWITCH were each superior to CONTROL (p=0.002), with effect sizes of 0.68 and 0.81 respectively, while MET and SWITCH did not differ. More gastrointestinal problems occurred in MET than in SWITCH or CONTROL. The data safety monitoring board closed the perphenazine-SWITCH arm because 35.2% of subjects discontinued treatment due to psychiatric worsening. These data suggest that pediatric antipsychotic-related overweight/obesity can be reduced by adding metformin or switching to a lower risk antipsychotic. Healthy lifestyle education is not sufficient to prevent ongoing BMI z-score increase."

Overall, our data resolve how DNA methylation in plants can be established in heterochromatin independently of RdDM; suggest that DRMs have emerged to target euchromatin; and link DNMT3 loss in angiosperms to the initiation of heterochromatic CHH methylation by CMT2."

Although mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known as the key regulator of autophagy induction, the mechanism by which mTOR regulates autophagy has remained elusive. Here, we identify that mTOR phosphorylates a mammalian homologue of Atg13 and the mammalian Atg1 homologues ULK1 and ULK2. The mammalian Atg13 binds both ULK1 and ULK2 and mediates the interaction of the ULK proteins with FIP200. The binding of Atg13 stabilizes and activates ULK and facilitates the phosphorylation of FIP200 by ULK, whereas knockdown of Atg13 inhibits autophagosome formation. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or leucine deprivation, the conditions that induce autophagy, leads to dephosphorylation of ULK1, ULK2, and Atg13 and activates ULK to phosphorylate FIP200. These findings demonstrate that the ULK-Atg13-FIP200 complexes are direct targets of mTOR and important regulators of autophagy in response to mTOR signaling."

Miglustat, a drug used to treat Gaucher and Niemann-Pick disease, suppresses astrocyte pathogenic activities and ameliorates EAE.

Here we show that Ctf4 recruits the Chl1 helicase to the replisome via a conserved interaction motif that Chl1 shares with GINS and polymerase \u03b1. We visualize recruitment by EM analysis of a reconstituted Chl1-Ctf4-GINS assembly. The Chl1 helicase facilitates replication fork progression under conditions of nucleotide depletion, partly independently of Ctf4 interaction. Conversely, Ctf4 interaction, but not helicase activity, is required for Chl1's role in sister chromatid cohesion. A physical interaction between Chl1 and the cohesin complex during S phase suggests that Chl1 contacts cohesin to facilitate its acetylation. Our results reveal how Ctf4 forms a replisomal interaction hub that coordinates replication fork progression and sister chromatid cohesion establishment."

Nonsense mutation of p.C103X terminates the translation of acid alpha-glucosidase halfway through its biosynthesis and is deduced not to allow formation of the active site pocket. The mutant proteins resulting from these missense and nonsense mutations found in patients with Pompe disease are predictably unstable and degraded quickly in cells. The structural change caused by p.G576S is predicted to be small, and cells from a subject homozygous for this amino acid substitution exhibited 15 and 11% of the normal enzyme activity levels for an artificial substrate and glycogen, respectively, and corresponding amounts of the enzyme protein on Western blotting. No accumulation of glycogen was found in organs including skeletal muscle in the subject, and thus the residual enzyme activity could protect cells from glycogen storage. On the other hand, p.E689K, which is known as a neutral polymorphism, little affected the three-dimensional structure of acid alpha-glucosidase.

Adding 1\u2009\u03bcM vitamin A changed light-induced transmembrane potential difference significantly, whereas 5\u2009\u03bcM dramatically induced membrane depolarization and triggered intracellular calcium elevation.

Using a novel computational method, we show that 18S and 28S pre-rRNA are subject to circadian regulation in a nuclear RNA sequencing time course. A population of snoRNA with circadian expression is identified that is functionally associated with rRNA modification. More generally, we find the abundance of snoRNA known to modify 18S and 28S to be inversely correlated with the abundance of their target. Cyclic patterns in the expression of a number of snoRNA indicate a coordination with rRNA maturation, potentially through an upregulation in their biogenesis, or their release from mature rRNA at the end of the previous cycle of rRNA maturation, in antiphase with the diurnal peak in pre-rRNA. Few cyclic snoRNA have cyclic host genes, indicating the action of regulatory mechanisms in addition to transcriptional activation of the host gene. For highly expressed independently transcribed snoRNA, we find a characteristic RNA polymerase II and H3K4me3 signature that correlates with mean snoRNA expression over the day."

Many eukaryotic genomes contain isochore regions, mosaics of homogeneous GC content that can abruptly change from one neighboring isochore to the next. Isochores are broken into families that are characterized by their GC levels. We identified 4,339 compositionally distinct domains and 331 of these were identified as long homogeneous genome regions (LHGRs). We assigned these to four families based on finite mixture models of GC content. We then characterized each family with respect to exon length, gene content, and transposable elements. The LHGR pattern of soybeans is unique in that while the majority of the genes within LHGRs are found within a single LHGR family with a narrow GC range (Family B), that family is not the highest in GC content as seen in vertebrates and invertebrates. Instead Family B has a mean GC content of 35%. The range of GC content for all LHGRs is 16-59% GC which is a larger range than what is typical of vertebrates. This is the first study in which LHGRs have been identified in soybeans and the functions of the genes within the LHGRs have been analyzed."

However, it remains unclear how this enzyme acetylates microtubules over long distances in axons. Here, we show that loss of ATAT1 impairs axonal transport in neurons in vivo, and cell-free motility assays confirm a requirement of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation for proper bidirectional vesicular transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that the main cellular pool of ATAT1 is transported at the cytosolic side of neuronal vesicles that are moving along axons. Together, our data suggest that axonal transport of ATAT1-enriched vesicles is the predominant driver of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in axons."

We find that the PLN R14del mutation induces Ca(2+) handling abnormalities, electrical instability, abnormal cytoplasmic distribution of PLN protein and increases expression of molecular markers of cardiac hypertrophy in iPSC-CMs. Gene correction using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) ameliorates the R14del-associated disease phenotypes in iPSC-CMs. In addition, we show that knocking down the endogenous PLN and simultaneously expressing a codon-optimized PLN gene reverses the disease phenotype in vitro.

For expression, H3K27me3 marks are removed and replaced by TrxG protein catalysed histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Although H3K27 demethylases have been identified, the mechanism by which these enzymes are targeted to specific genomic regions to remove H3K27me3 marks has not been established. Here, we demonstrate a two-step mechanism for UTX-mediated demethylation at muscle-specific genes during myogenesis. Although the transactivator Six4 initially recruits UTX to the regulatory region of muscle genes, the resulting loss of H3K27me3 marks is limited to the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. Removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark within the coding region then requires RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. Interestingly, blocking Pol II elongation on transcribed genes leads to increased H3K27me3 within the coding region, and formation of bivalent (H3K27me3/H3K4me3) chromatin domains. Thus, removal of repressive H3K27me3 marks by UTX occurs through targeted recruitment followed by spreading across the gene."

Inbred strains of mice independently derived from natural populations have the potential to increase power in genetic studies with the addition of novel genetic variation. Here, we perform exome-enrichment and high-throughput sequencing (~8\u00d7 coverage) of 26 wild-derived strains known in the mouse research community as the \"Montpellier strains.\" We identified 1.46\u00a0million SNPs in our dataset, approximately 19% of which have not been detected from other inbred strains. This novel genetic variation is expected to contribute to phenotypic variation, as they include 18,496 nonsynonymous variants and 262 early stop codons. Simulations demonstrate that the higher density of genetic variation in the Montpellier strains provides increased power for quantitative genetic studies. Inasmuch as the power to connect genotype to phenotype depends on genetic variation, it is important to incorporate these additional genetic strains into future research programs."

However, it remains unclarified of the mechanism of 4SC-202. In the study, we found that 4SC-202 treatment could inhibit cell viability, induce apoptosis and cause G2/M cell cycle arrest in MDS cell line SKM-1. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was correlated with disease progression and chemotherapy resistance. Here, we reported that 4SC-202 could down-regulate the expression of HO-1, and up-regulation of HO-1 could significantly attenuate the 4SC-202-induced apoptosis in SKM-1 cells. In addition, the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway was suppressed by 4SC-202, while up-regulation of HO-1 significantly weakened the 4SC-202-induced suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway, thereby attenuating the efficacy of 4SC-202. However, down-regulation of HO-1 enhanced the sensitivity of 4SC-202 against SKM-1 cells. Moreover, SKM-1 cells were transfected with HO-1 overexpression lentivirus, subsequently injected into the tail vein of NOD/SCID mice, followed by administration of 4SC-202 in mice. As a result, up-regulation HO-1 could partially attenuate 4SC-202-suppressed MDS cells growth in NOD/SCID mice. In conclusion, 4SC-202 could induce apoptosis via the NF-\u03baB pathway, and our present finding may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for MDS."

Their apparent proteasome affinities are not directly related to their stabilities or functions. That is, ubiquitin-like domains in proteins not part of the ubiquitin proteasome system may bind the proteasome more tightly than domains in proteins that are bona fide components. We propose that proteins with ubiquitin-like domains have properties other than proteasome binding that confer stability. We show that one of these properties is the absence of accessible disordered regions that allow the proteasome to initiate degradation. In support of this model, we find that Mdy2 is degraded in yeast when a disordered region in the protein becomes exposed and that the attachment of a disordered region to Ubp6 leads to its degradation."

Here, we present MapR, a method that utilizes RNase H to guide micrococcal nuclease to R-loops, which are subsequently cleaved, released, and identified by sequencing. MapR detects R-loops formed at promoters and active enhancers that are likely to form transient R-loops due to the low transcriptional output of these regulatory elements and the short-lived nature of enhancer RNAs. MapR is as specific as existing techniques and more sensitive, allowing for genome-wide coverage with low input material in a fraction of the time."

There is an unmet medical need in the local treatment of GB for drug delivery vehicles that provide sustained local release of small molecules and combination drugs over several months. Herein, key quantitative lessons from the use of local and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy for GB in the clinic are outlined, and it is discussed how these can inform the development of next-generation therapies. Several recent approaches are highlighted, and it is proposed that long-lasting soft materials can capture the value of stiff BCNU-loaded wafers while addressing a number of unmet medical needs. Finally, it is suggested that improved communication between materials scientists, biomedical scientists, and clinicians may facilitate translation of these materials into the clinic and ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes."

One of the hallmark phenotypes of FA is cellular hypersensitivity to agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), such as mitomycin C (MMC). FA is caused by mutation in at least 14 genes which function in the resolution of ICLs during replication. The FA proteins act within the context of a protein network in coordination with multiple repair factors that function in distinct pathways. SNM1B/Apollo is a member of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase/\u03b2CASP family of nucleases and has been demonstrated to function in ICL repair. However, the relationship between SNM1B and the FA protein network is not known. In the current study, we establish that SNM1B functions epistatically to the central FA factor, FANCD2, in cellular survival after ICL damage and homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We also demonstrate that MMC-induced chromosomal anomalies are increased in SNM1B-depleted cells, and this phenotype is not further exacerbated upon depletion of either FANCD2 or another key FA protein, FANCI. Furthermore, we find that SNM1B is required for proper localization of critical repair factors, including FANCD2, BRCA1 and RAD51, to MMC-induced subnuclear foci. Our findings demonstrate that SNM1B functions within the FA pathway during the repair of ICL damage."

We have discussed the evidence linking nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)1, an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, to the onset and progression of obesity-induced insulin resistance. On a molecular level, crosstalk between downstream NOD1 effectors and the insulin receptor pathway inhibits insulin signaling, potentially through reduced insulin receptor substrate action. In vivo studies have demonstrated that NOD1 activation induces peripheral, hepatic, and whole-body insulin resistance. Also, NOD1-deficient models are protected from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, hematopoietic NOD1 deficiency prevented HFD-induced changes in proinflammatory macrophage polarization status, thus protecting against the development of metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance. Serum from HFD-fed mice activated NOD1 signaling ex vivo; however, the molecular identity of the activating factors remains unclear. Many have proposed that an HFD changes the gut permeability, resulting in increased translocation of bacterial fragments and increased circulating NOD1 ligands. In contrast, others have suggested that NOD1 ligands are endogenous and potentially lipid-derived metabolites produced during states of nutrient overload. Nevertheless, that NOD1 contributes to the development of insulin resistance, and that NOD1-based therapy might provide benefit, is an exciting advancement in metabolic research."

These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology. "

One hundred seventy-nine TNBC patients were consecutively enrolled and received EC-D neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Plasma samples were collected before neoadjuvant treatment, and relative expression of angiogenic miRNAs was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cardiotoxicity was defined by any one of the following symptoms: heart failure, acute coronary artery syndrome, fatal arrhythmia and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) declined by 10% from baseline to an absolute value below 53%. The LVEF level was decreased, while cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were increased by EC-D neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In total, 9 cases (5.0%) of cardiotoxicity occurred. Let-7f, miR-126 and miR-210 were negatively associated with the cTnI level, while let-7f, miR-19a and miR-130a were negatively correlated with the NT-proBNP level. Compared to noncardiotoxicity patients, the expression levels of let-7f, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-126, and miR-210 were decreased in cardiotoxicity patients. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that let-7f and miR-126 independently predicted low cardiotoxicity risk, and a receiver operating characteristics curve illustrated that let-7f (area under curve [AUC]=0.815, 95% CI: 0.725-0.906) and miR-126 (AUC=0.731, 95% CI: 0.624-0.838) as well as the combination of these two miRNAs (AUC=0.885, 95% CI: 0.818-0.952) could effectively distinguish cardiotoxicity patients from noncardiotoxicity patients.

Cellular senescence, an important hallmark of aging, is a critical factor that impairs repair and regeneration of damaged cells in cardiovascular tissues whereas autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process is an essential inherent mechanism that removes senescent cells throughout life time in all tissues. Several recent reviews have highlighted the fact that all longevity treatment paradigms to mitigate progression of aging-related pathologies converge in induction of autophagy, activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin pathway, and inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). These longevity treatments include health style changes such as caloric restriction, and drug treatments using rapamycin, the first FDA-approved longevity drug, as well as other experimental longevity drugs such as metformin, rapamycin, aspirin, and resveratrol. However, in the heart tissue, autophagy induction has to be tightly regulated since evidence show excessive autophagy results in cardiomyopathy and heart failure.

The clustering of active RNA polymerase I transcription units from several chromosomes at nucleoli is probably the best-characterized and universally accepted example. RNA polymerase II localization in mammalian nuclei occurs in distinct concentrated foci that are several-fold fewer in number compared to the number of active genes and transcription units. Individual transcribed genes cluster at these shared transcription factories in a nonrandom manner, preferentially associating with heterologous, coregulated genes. We suggest that the three-dimensional (3D) conformation and relative arrangement of chromosomes in the nucleus has a major role in delivering tissue-specific gene-expression programs."

This protozoan has multiple proteinases that are mainly of the cysteine proteinase (CP) type, some of which are known to be involved in the parasite's virulence. Here, a novel T. vaginalis CP-encoding gene, tvcp12, was identified and characterized. tvcp12 is 948 bp long and encodes a predicted 34.4 kDa protein that has the characteristics of the papain-like CP family. TvCP12 does not appear to have a signal peptide, suggesting that this is a cytoplasmic CP. By Southern blot assays, the tvcp12 gene was found as a single copy in the T. vaginalis genome. Remarkably, Northern blot experiments showed a single transcript band of approximately 1.3 kb in the mRNA obtained from parasites grown in low iron conditions and no transcript was observed in the mRNA from parasites grown in high iron conditions. By RT-PCR assays, a 270 bp band was amplified from the cDNA of parasites grown in low iron medium, which was very faint when cDNA from parasites grown in high iron conditions was used. Transcripts of the 3' region obtained in both iron conditions presented differences in their poly(A) tail length. These data suggest that tvcp12 is another gene that is negatively regulated by iron and that the length of the poly(A) tail may be one of the factors involved in the iron-modulated protein expression."

Baseline 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed. Significant ventricular ectopy (VE) and supraventricular ectopy (SVE) were defined as \u226510 VE or SVE/hour, or the presence of high-grade ectopy. Three-year composite clinical outcome of death, aortic dissection, or aortic root replacement was analyzed. There were 274 analyzable monitors on unique patients from 11 centers. Twenty subjects (7%) had significant VE, 13 (5%) significant SVE; of these, 2 (1%) had both. None had sustained ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia. VE was independently associated with increasing number of major Ghent criteria (odds ratio [OR]\u202f=\u202f2.13/each additional criterion, p\u202f=\u202f0.03) and greater left ventricular end-diastolic dimension z-score (OR\u202f=\u202f1.47/each 1 unit increase in z-score, p\u202f=\u202f0.01). SVE was independently associated with greater aortic sinotubular junction diameter z-score (OR\u202f=\u202f1.56/each 1 unit increase in z-score, p\u202f=\u202f0.03). The composite clinical outcome (14 events) was not related to VE or SVE (p \u2265 0.3), but was independently related to heart rate variability (higher triangular index). In conclusion, in this cohort, VE and SVE were rare. VE was related to larger BSA-adjusted left ventricular size. Routine ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring may be useful for risk stratification in select MFS patients."

UL9 loops and alters the DNA helix of the origin regardless of the phasing of the binding sites. DNase I and micrococcal nuclease footprinting show that UL9 binds two sites in the origin and loops the AT-rich DNA between them independent of the topology of the DNA. KMnO4 and dimethyl sulfate footprinting further show that UL9 alters the DNA helix in the AT region. In contrast to the looping reaction, however, helical distortion requires the free energy of supercoiled DNA. UL9 also loops and distorts the origin DNA of a replication-defective mutant with a 6-bp insertion in the AT region. Because the helical distortion of this mutant DNA is different from that of functional origins, we conclude that an imperfect tertiary structure of the mutant DNA may contribute to its loss of replication function."

We deployed proteome-wide proximity labeling to identify factors whose inclusion in GFI1B complexes depends upon GFI1B's obligate effector, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). We show that GFI1B preferentially recruits core and putative elements of the BRAF-histone deacetylase (HDAC) (BHC) chromatin-remodeling complex (LSD1, RCOR1, HMG20A, HMG20B, HDAC1, HDAC2, PHF21A, GSE1, ZMYM2, and ZNF217) in an LSD1-dependent manner to control acquisition of erythroid traits by K562 cells. Among these elements, depletion of both HMG20A and HMG20B or of GSE1 blocks GFI1B-mediated erythroid differentiation, phenocopying impaired differentiation brought on by LSD1 depletion or disruption of GFI1B-LSD1 binding. These findings demonstrate the central role of the GFI1B-LSD1 interaction as a determinant of BHC complex recruitment to enable cell fate decisions driven by GFI1B."

A large amount of data, based mainly on the Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS), one of the best characterized progeroid laminopathy, has highlighted the role of lamins in multiple DNA activities, including replication, repair, chromatin organization and telomere function. On the other hand, the phenotypes generated by mutations affecting genes directly acting on DNA function, as mutations in the helicases WRN and BLM or in the polymerase pol\u03b4, share many of the traits of progeroid laminopathies. These evidences support the hypothesis of a concerted implication of DNA function and lamins in aging. We focus here on these aspects to contribute to the comprehension of the driving forces acting in progeroid syndromes and premature aging."

Growing evidence suggests a role for clathrin and/or endocytosis in the regulation of this pathway, but conflicting results exist and demand a deeper mechanistic understanding. We investigated the consequences of clathrin depletion on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in cell lines and found a pronounced reduction in \u03b2-catenin protein levels, which affects the amount of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and \u03b2-catenin target gene expression. While we found no evidence that clathrin affects \u03b2-catenin levels via endocytosis or multivesicular endosome formation, an inhibition of protein transport through the biosynthetic pathway led to reduced levels of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 and cell adhesion molecules of the cadherin family, thereby affecting steady-state levels of \u03b2-catenin. We conclude that clathrin impacts on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by controlling exocytosis of transmembrane proteins including cadherins and Wnt co-receptors that together control the membrane-bound and soluble pools of \u03b2-catenin."

The neuroprotective properties of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the paracrine signaling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been examined in multiple pre-clinical trials of ALS with promising results. The data from these initial trials indicate a reduction in the rate of disease progression. The mechanism through which stem cells achieve this reduction is of major interest.

Here, we show that the progressive loss of fertility in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking piRNAs is not caused by derepression of REs or other piRNA targets but, rather, is mediated by epigenetic silencing of all of the replicative histone genes. In the absence of piRNAs, downstream components of the piRNA pathway relocalize from germ granules and piRNA targets to histone mRNAs to synthesize antisense small RNAs (sRNAs) and induce transgenerational silencing. Removal of the downstream components of the piRNA pathway restores histone mRNA expression and fertility in piRNA mutants, and the inheritance of histone sRNAs in wild-type worms adversely affects their fertility for multiple generations. We conclude that sRNA-mediated silencing of histone genes impairs the fertility of piRNA mutants and may serve to maintain piRNAs across evolution."

It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin."

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, associated with modulation of acetylcholine levels and amyloid beta accumulation & dopamine level and alpha-synuclein oligomerization, respectively. Therefore, a better understanding of their pathological mechanisms reveals novel target proteins and encourages exploitation of suitable lead molecules. In the present study, targets for AD and PD were sought not only to suppress the pathological condition but to restore the normal physiological function. In this view, activation of retinoic acid receptor alpha can be formulated as a novel target to improve choline acetyltransferase transcription that works together with acetylcholine esterase and beta-secretase 1 inhibition against AD. Likewise, inhibition of Polo-like kinase 2 fails to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein and motivates efficient autophagic clearance. Therefore, PLK2 inhibition, together with L-DOPA supplementation and monoamine oxidase B inhibition widens the therapeutic options for PD. As oxidative stress is the major factor for neurodegeneration, AMPK activation stabilizes energy metabolism and Sirtuin 1 (histone deacetylase 1) activation enhances AMPK, PGC1a and Nrf gene expressions. Phytochemical extracts from saffron stigma were broadly appreciated on memory enhancement and cognition. However, the exact mechanism was not established. Therefore, this inspires the exploitation of phytochemicals in saffron stigma extract using in-silico tools, to anticipate lead molecules that interact with various neurodegeneration associated protein targets."

In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which ergosterol inhibits bladder carcinogenesis. Rats were given an N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BHBN) solution ad libitum, and then a promoter [saccharin sodium (SS), DL-tryptophan, or BHBN] was administered together with ergosterol or its metabolite, brassicasterol. The bladders were removed from rats, and the inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis promotion was evaluated by an agglutination assay with concanavalin A (Con A). Although the oral administration of ergosterol inhibited the promotion of bladder carcinogenesis with SS, the intraperitoneal administration of brassicasterol showed a stronger effect. The effect of brassicasterol on carcinogenesis promotion was observed regardless of the type of promoter. Administration of testosterone to castrated rats increased the number of cell aggregates caused by Con A. In contrast, intraperitoneal administration of brassicasterol to castrated rats treated with testosterone significantly decreased the number of cell aggregates, confirming the inhibition of bladder carcinogenesis promotion. The inhibitory effect of ergosterol on bladder carcinogenesis is due to brassicasterol, a metabolite of ergosterol. The action of brassicasterol via androgen signaling may play a role in the inhibitory effect on bladder carcinogenesis promotion."

CpG-island promoters are generally unmethylated and are often found in housekeeping genes. However, their nucleotide sequences and existence per se are not conserved between humans and mice, which may be due to evolutionary gain and loss of the regulatory regions. In this study, human and rhesus monkey genomes, with moderately conserved sequences, were compared at base resolution. Using transcription start site data, we first validated our methods' ability to identify orthologous promoters and indicated a limitation using the 5' end of curated gene models, such as NCBI RefSeq, as their transcription start sites. We found that, in addition to deamination mutations, insertions and deletions of bases, repeats, and long fragments contributed to the mutations of CpG dinucleotides. We also observed that the G\u2009+\u2009C contents tended to change in CpG-poor environments, while CpG content was altered in G\u2009+\u2009C-rich environments. While loss of CpG\u00a0islands can be caused by gradual decreases in CpG sites, gain of these islands appear to require two distinct nucleotide altering steps. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the process of acquisition and diversification of CpG-island promoters in vertebrates."

UV exposure causes DNA damage in skin which may initiate cutaneous skin cancers including melanoma. Melanoma arises from melanocytes, the melanin-producing skin cells, following genetic dysregulations resulting into hyperproliferative phenotype and neoplastic transformation. Both UVA and UVB exposures to the skin are believed to trigger melanocytic hyperplasia and melanomagenesis. Melanocytes by themselves are deficient in repair of oxidative DNA damage and UV-induced photoproducts. Nicotinamide, an active form of vitamin B3 and a critical component of the human body's defense system has been shown to prevent certain cancers including nonmelanoma skin cancers. However, the mechanism of nicotinamide's protective effects is not well understood. Here, we investigated potential protective effects and mechanism of nicotinamide against UVA- and/or UVB- induced damage in normal human epidermal melanocytes. Our data demonstrated an appreciable protective effect of nicotinamide against UVA- and/or UVB- induced DNA damage in melanocytes by decreasing both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels. We found that the photoprotective response of nicotinamide was associated with the activation of nucleotide excision repair genes and NRF2 signaling. Further studies are needed to validate our findings in in vivo models."

The clinical records of 203 patients with a clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy were reviewed to identify diagnostic pitfalls. We also examined 12 features supporting a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (red flag features: orofacial dystonia, disproportionate antecollis, camptocormia and/or Pisa syndrome, contractures of hands or feet, inspiratory sighs, severe dysphonia, severe dysarthria, snoring, cold hands and feet, pathological laughter and crying, jerky myoclonic postural/action tremor and polyminimyoclonus) and seven disability milestones (frequent falls, use of urinary catheters, wheelchair dependent, unintelligible speech, cognitive impairment, severe dysphagia, residential care). Of 203 cases, 160 (78.8%) were correctly diagnosed in life and had pathologically confirmed multiple system atrophy. The remaining 21.2% (43/203) had alternative pathological diagnoses including Lewy body disease (12.8%; n = 26), progressive supranuclear palsy (6.4%; n = 13), cerebrovascular diseases (1%; n = 2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (0.5%; n = 1) and cerebellar degeneration (0.5%; n = 1). More patients with multiple system atrophy developed ataxia, stridor, dysphagia and falls than patients with Lewy body disease; resting tremor, pill-rolling tremor and hallucinations were more frequent in Lewy body disease. Although patients with multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy shared several symptoms and signs, ataxia and stridor were more common in multiple system atrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed increased likelihood of multiple system atrophy versus Lewy body disease and progressive supranuclear palsy if a patient developed orthostatic hypotension or urinary incontinence with the requirement for urinary catheters [multiple system atrophy versus Lewy body disease: odds ratio (OR): 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-3.7, P = 0.021; multiple system atrophy versus progressive supranuclear palsy: OR: 11.2, 95% CI: 3.2-39.2, P < 0.01].

Multiple system atrophy patients with predominant parkinsonian signs had a higher number of red flag features than patients with Lewy body disease (OR: 8.8, 95% CI: 3.2-24.2, P < 0.01) and progressive supranuclear palsy (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.7-13.6, P < 0.01). The number of red flag features in multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar signs was also higher than in Lewy body disease (OR: 7.0, 95% CI: 2.5-19.5, P < 0.01) and progressive supranuclear palsy (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-8.9, P = 0.032). Patients with multiple system atrophy had shorter latency to reach use of urinary catheter and longer latency to residential care than progressive supranuclear palsy patients, whereas patients with Lewy body disease took longer to reach multiple milestones than patients with multiple system atrophy.

Admission serum CypA concentrations were detected in 66 acute cerebral infarction patients and in 52 healthy individuals. Inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adhesion molecules, interleukins, and matrix-metalloproteases, were also assessed. We also examined the relationship between plasma biomarkers, blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure, the carotid artery velocity, the prognostic assessment with modified Rankin scale, and stroke recurrence. Plasma CypA concentration was higher on the first day of hospitalization in the high BP stroke group than in normal BP stroke group, which was statistically significant, which was observed even in the third month and sixth month follow-up outpatient periods. For stroke recurrence prediction, there was an important association between the higher (>60) pulse pressure on the seventh day of hospitalization and CypA level on the third month and sixth month follow-up outpatient periods. Our study revealed higher circulating serum levels of CypA in the hypertensive stroke group than in the non-hypertensive stroke group.

The incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology has hampered the development of prevention and treatment strategies leading to the high morbidity and mortality rates. NSAIDs are known to modulate macroautophagy, a process indispensable for intestinal homeostasis. Whether NSAIDs stimulate or repress macroautophagy and how this correlates with the clinical manifestations of NSAID enteropathy, however, remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine whether NSAIDs impaired macroautophagy and how this affects macroautophagy-regulated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) processes essential for intestinal homeostasis (i.e., clearance of invading pathogens, secretion and composition of mucus building blocks, and inflammatory response). We show that NSAID treatment of IECs inhibits macroautophagy in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition was likely attributed to a reduction in the area and/or distribution of lysosomes available for degradation of macroautophagy-targeted cargo. Importantly, IEC regulatory processes necessary for intestinal homeostasis and dependent on macroautophagy were dysfunctional in the presence of NSAIDs. Since macroautophagy is essential for gastrointestinal health, NSAID-induced inhibition of macroautophagy might contribute to the severity of intestinal injury by compromising the integrity of the mucosal barrier, preventing the clearance of invading microbes, and exacerbating the inflammatory response."

This study for the first time investigated the fate of 28 different organic micropollutants (MPs) due to the dosing of iron-rich and aluminum-rich DWTS in a pilot rising main sewer. Nine MPs had an initial rapid removal within 1-hr (i.e., 10-80%) due to Fe-DWTS dosing. The formation of FeS particles due to Fe-DWTS dosing was responsible for the removal of dissolved sulfides (80% reduction comparing to control sewer). Further particle characterization using SEM-EDS, XRD and ATR-FTIR confirmed that FeS particles formation played an important role in the removal of MPs from wastewater. Adsorption of MPs onto the FeS particles was likely the possible mechanism for their rapid removal. In comparison to iron-rich DWTS, aluminum-rich DWTS had very limited beneficial effects in removing MPs from wastewater. The degradability of degradable MPs, including caffeine, paraxanthine, paracetamol, metformin, cyclamate, cephalexin, and MIAA were not affected by the DWTS dosing. Some non-degradable MPs, including cotinine, hydroxycotinine, tramadol, gabapentin, desvenlafaxine, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, fluconazole, sulfamethoxazole, acesulfame, saccharin and sucralose were also not impacted by the DWTS dosing. This study systematically assessed the additional benefits of discharging Fe-DWTS to the sewer network i.e., the removal of MPs from the liquid phase thereby reducing its load to the treatment plant. The results corroborate the discharge of Fe-rich DWTS in sewers as an effective and beneficial way of managing the waste by-product."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from TCGA and Oncomine databases were analyzed to determine the expression of EZH2 and the top five coexpressed genes in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer and the clinical significance the coexpressed genes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed to predict the functions and pathways of EZH2 using pathway annotation. The role of EZH2 in the C4-2 human prostate cancer cell line was studied in vitro. RESULTS Analysis of 16 micro-arrays identified 185 genes that were coexpressed with EZH2. The top five coexpressed genes were MCM4, KIAA0101, MKI67, RRM2, and CDC25a. Increased expression of these genes and EZH2 were associated with reduced survival. Coexpressed genes were involved in biological networks associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA damage. The effects of EZH2 on prostate cancer cell was validated in vitro as knockdown of EZH2 resulted in a G2/M cell cycle arrest, increased DNA damage, and reduced colony number. CONCLUSIONS Coexpression analysis of EZH2 identified its role in the cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA repair. The molecular mechanisms involved in EZH2 gene expression in the cell response to DNA damage requires further study to determine whether EZH2 is a potential human cancer biomarker."

Since bacterial cyclodipeptides (CDPs) possess cytotoxic properties in HeLa cells with inhibiting Akt/S6k phosphorylation, the mechanism of CDPs cytotoxicity involved was deepened. Results showed that the antiproliferative effect of CDPs occurred by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, inhibiting the mTORC1/mTORC2 complexes in a TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. In addition, the CDPs blocked protein kinases from multiple signaling pathways involved in survival, proliferation, invasiveness, apoptosis, autophagy, and energy metabolism, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2, PI3K/JNK/PKA, p27Kip1/CDK1/survivin, MAPK, HIF-1, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, HSP27, EMT, CSCs, and receptors, such as EGF/ErbB2/HGF/Met.

Dysfunction of the hypothalamus has been associated with a broad range of disorders; many of which are sex-dependent in prevalence. Small nucleolar (sno) RNAs are a group of small RNAs located in nucleoli that modulate chemical modifications and maturation of ribosomal or other RNAs. Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS. Data from mice revealed Snord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally. These results provide a new lead for understanding the mechanism(s) related to hyperphagia and obesity symptoms in PWS patients."

However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and also the necessity of this modification for other CTCF functions remain unknown. In this study, we identified potential sites of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation within the N-terminal domain of CTCF and generated a mutant deficient in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Using this CTCF mutant, we demonstrated the requirement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation for optimal CTCF function in transcriptional activation of the p19ARF promoter and inhibition of cell proliferation. By using a newly generated isogenic insulator reporter cell line, the CTCF insulator function at the mouse Igf2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) was found to be compromised by the CTCF mutation. The association and simultaneous presence of PARP-1 and CTCF at the ICR, confirmed by single and serial chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, were found to be independent of CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. These results suggest a model of CTCF regulation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation whereby CTCF and PARP-1 form functional complexes at sites along the DNA, producing a dynamic reversible modification of CTCF. By using bioinformatics tools, numerous sites of CTCF and PARP-1 colocalization were demonstrated, suggesting that such regulation of CTCF may take place at the genome level."

An effective causal therapy is often not available and can only be developed when the underlying causes of the disease are understood. In this review, we focus on Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), which is a rare lipid-storage disorder. Lipids, in particular phospholipids, are a major component of the cell membrane and play important roles in cellular functions, such as extracellular receptor signaling, intracellular second messengers and cellular pressure regulation. An excessive storage of fats, as seen in NPC1, can cause permanent damage to cells and tissues in the brain and peripheral nervous system, but also in other parts of the body. Here, we summarize the impact of NPC1 pathology on several organ systems, as revealed in experimental animal models and humans, and give an overview of current available treatment options."

It has shown efficacy against tumors that express HER2 and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials. We here show that the antitumor activity of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is dependent on the expression level of HER2 protein in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines negative for HER2 amplification. We established isogenic CRC cell lines that express various levels of HER2 protein in the absence of HER2 amplification, and we found that cells that express HER2 at a high level were sensitive to [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan but not to conventional HER2-targeted therapies. Furthermore, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan manifested a bystander killing effect both in vitro and in vivo, with cells essentially negative for HER2 expression also being killed in the presence of HER2-expressing cells, an effect that has the potential to overcome heterogeneity of HER2 expression in CRC tumors. Our results thus suggest that [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan warrants further study as a potential treatment for CRC tumors that express HER2 protein in the absence of HER2 amplification."

Many genes have been identified as playing causative roles in ENS dysplasia and HSCR, among them the endothelin receptor type B gene (Ednrb) has been identified to play an important role. Mutation of Ednrb causes a series of symptoms that include deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and aganglionosis. In our previous studies of three rat models carrying the same spotting lethal (sl) mutation on Ednrb, the haplotype of a region on chromosome (Chr) 2 was found to be responsible for the differing severities of the HSCR-like symptoms. To confirm that the haplotype of the responsible region on Chr 2 modifies the severity of aganglionosis caused by Ednrb mutation and to recreate a rat model with severe symptoms, we selected the GK inbred strain, whose haplotype in the responsible region on Chr 2 resembles that of the rat strain in which severe symptoms accompany the Ednrbsl mutation. An Ednrb mutation was introduced into the GK rat by crossing with F344-Ednrbsl and by genome editing. The null mutation of Ednrb was found to cause embryonic death in F2 progeny possessing the GK haplotype in the responsible region on Chr 2. The results of this study are unexpected, and they provide new clues and animal models that promise to contribute to studies on the genetic regulatory network in the development of ENS and on embryogenesis."

In the present study, KPC1 expression was heightened in left ventricular cardiomyocytes of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), in I/R-myocardium in vivo and in hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocytes in vitro. Overexpression of KPC1 reduced infarction size and cell apoptosis in I/R rat hearts. Similarly, the forced expression of KPC1 restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytochrome c release driven by H/R in H9c2 cells, whereas reducing cell apoptosis, and knockdown of KPC1 by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) deteriorated cell apoptosis induced by H/R. Mechanistically, forced expression of KPC1 promoted Bax protein degradation, which was abolished by proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that KPC1 promoted proteasomal degradation of Bax. Furthermore, KPC1 prevented basal and apoptotic stress-induced Bax translocation to mitochondria. Bax can be a novel target for the antiapoptotic effects of KPC1 on I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and render mechanistic penetration into at least a subset of the mitochondrial effects of KPC1."

Recently, the development and refinement of optogenetic techniques boosted research in the cerebellar field and, impressively, revolutionized the methodological approach and endowed the investigations with entirely new capabilities. This translated into a significant improvement in the data acquired for sensorimotor tests, allowing one to correlate single-cell activity with motor behavior to the extent of determining the role of single neuronal types and single connection pathways in controlling precise aspects of movement kinematics. These levels of specificity in correlating neuronal activity to behavior could not be achieved in the past, when electrical and pharmacological stimulations were the only available experimental tools. The application of optogenetics to the investigation of the cerebellar role in higher-order and cognitive functions, which involves a high degree of connectivity with multiple brain areas, has been even more significant. It is possible that, in this field, optogenetics has changed the game, and the number of investigations using optogenetics to study the cerebellar role in non-sensorimotor functions in awake animals is growing. The main issues addressed by these studies are the cerebellar role in epilepsy (through connections to the hippocampus and the temporal lobe), schizophrenia and cognition, working memory for decision making, and social behavior. It is also worth noting that optogenetics opened a new perspective for cerebellar neurostimulation in patients (e.g., for epilepsy treatment and stroke rehabilitation), promising unprecedented specificity in the targeted pathways that could be either activated or inhibited."

Moreover, given the correlation between Eph receptor/ephrin expression and cancer pathogenesis, their expression patterns could serve important diagnostic and prognostic purposes. However, profiling Eph receptor and ephrin expression has been challenging. Here we describe a novel and straightforward approach to catalog the Eph receptors present in cultured cells and tissues. By measuring the binding of ephrin Fc fusion proteins to Eph receptors in ELISA and pull-down assays, we determined that a mixture of four ephrins is suitable for isolating both EphA and EphB receptors in a single pull-down. We then used mass spectrometry to identify the Eph receptors present in the pull-downs and estimate their relative levels. This approach was validated in cultured human cancer cell lines, human tumor xenograft tissue grown in mice, and mouse brain tissue. The new mass spectrometry approach we have developed represents a useful tool for the identification of the spectrum of Eph receptors present in a biological sample and could also be extended to profiling ephrin expression."

On account of their shared evolutionary ancestry, the replication machinery found in archaea is similar to that found in eukaryotes. DNA replication is initiated at origins and is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but our limited understanding of archaea has uncovered a wide diversity of replication initiation mechanisms. Archaeal origins are sequence-based, as in bacteria, but are bound by initiator proteins that share homology with the eukaryotic origin recognition complex subunit Orc1 and helicase loader Cdc6). Unlike bacteria, archaea may have multiple origins per chromosome and multiple Orc1/Cdc6 initiator proteins. There is no consensus on how these archaeal origins are recognised- some are bound by a single Orc1/Cdc6 protein while others require a multi- Orc1/Cdc6 complex. Many archaeal genomes consist of multiple parts-the main chromosome plus several megaplasmids-and in polyploid species these parts are present in multiple copies. This poses a challenge to the regulation of DNA replication. However, one archaeal species (Haloferax volcanii) can survive without replication origins; instead, it uses homologous recombination as an alternative mechanism of initiation. This diversity in DNA replication initiation is all the more remarkable for having been discovered in only three groups of archaea where in vivo studies are possible."

We found that disrupting mitochondrial fission (DRP1/drp-1) or fusion (OPA1/eat-3, MFN/fzo-1) genes caused alterations in mitochondrial morphology that impacted both mitochondrial function and physiologic rates. While both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion mutants showed increased sensitivity to osmotic stress and anoxia, surprisingly we found that the mitochondrial fusion mutants eat-3 and fzo-1 are more resistant to both heat stress and oxidative stress. In exploring the mechanism of increased stress resistance, we found that disruption of mitochondrial fusion genes resulted in the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates that disrupting mitochondrial dynamics can have opposite effects on resistance to different types of stress. Our results suggest that disruption of mitochondrial fusion activates multiple stress response pathways that enhance resistance to specific stresses."

They bind to S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) through the F-box motif and deliver their protein substrate to the E3 ligase complex for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 16 (FBXL16) is a poorly studied F-box protein. As it does not interact with the scaffold protein cullin 1 (CUL1), we hypothesized that FBXL16 might not form a functional SCF-E3 ligase complex. In the present study, we found that FBXL16 up-regulates the levels of proteins targeted by SCF-E3 ligases, such as C-MYC, \u03b2-catenin, and steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3). Focusing on C-MYC, a well-known oncoprotein overexpressed in most human cancers, we show that FBXL16 stabilizes C-MYC by antagonizing FBW7-mediated C-MYC ubiquitination and degradation. Further, we found that although FBXL16 does not interact with CUL1, it interacts with SKP1 via its N-terminal F-box domain and with its substrate C-MYC via its C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) domain. We found that both the F-box domain and the LRR domain are important for FBXL16-mediated C-MYC stabilization. In line with its role in up-regulating the levels of the C-MYC and SRC-3 oncoproteins, FBXL16 promoted cancer cell growth and migration and colony formation in soft agar. Our findings reveal that FBXL16 is an F-box protein that antagonizes the activity of another F-box protein, FBW7, and thereby increases C-MYC stability, resulting in increased cancer cell growth and invasiveness."

In this study, we used origin recognition complex (ORC) binding and nucleosome occupancy patterns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis to train a machine learning algorithm to predict the position of active arm (noncentromeric) origins in the C. albicans genome. The model identified bona fide active origins as determined by the presence of replication intermediates on nondenaturing two-dimensional (2D) gels. Importantly, these origins function at their native chromosomal loci and also as autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) on a linear plasmid. A \"mini-ARS screen\" identified at least one and often two ARS regions of \u2265100 bp within each bona fide origin. Furthermore, a 15-bp AC-rich consensus motif was associated with the predicted origins and conferred autonomous replicating activity to the mini-ARSs. Thus, while centromeres and the origins associated with them are epigenetic, arm origins are dependent upon critical DNA features, such as a binding site for ORC and a propensity for nucleosome exclusion."

Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of G1/S phase transition genes (myelocytomatosis oncogene cellular homolog [Myc], cyclin D1/3, chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 [Cdt1]), concomitant with increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 and increased G1-S progression.

This study demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors enable the heat shock response in cultured spinal motor neurons, in a stress-dependent manner, and can improve the efficacy of HSP-inducing drugs in murine spinal cord cultures subjected to thermal or proteotoxic stress. The effect of particular HDAC inhibitors differed with the stress paradigm. The HDAC6 (class IIb) inhibitor, tubastatin A, acted as a co-inducer of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) expression with heat shock, but not with proteotoxic stress induced by expression of mutant SOD1 linked to familial ALS. Certain HDAC class I inhibitors (the pan inhibitor, SAHA, or the HDAC1/3 inhibitor, RGFP109) were HSP co-inducers comparable to the hydroxyamine arimoclomol in response to proteotoxic stress, but not thermal stress. Regardless, stress-induced Hsp70 expression could be enhanced by combining an HDAC inhibitor with either arimoclomol or with an HSP90 inhibitor that constitutively induced HSPs. HDAC inhibition failed to induce Hsp70 in motor neurons expressing ALS-linked mutant FUS, in which the heat shock response was suppressed; yet SAHA, RGFP109, and arimoclomol did reduce loss of nuclear FUS, a disease hallmark, and HDAC inhibition rescued the DNA repair response in iPSC-derived motor neurons carrying the FUS"

The agents currently available include calcium hydroxyl apatite (Coaptite\u00ae), carbon coated zirconium (Durasphere\u00ae); polydimethylsiloxane elastomer (Macroplastique\u00ae); and polyacrylamide hydrogel (Bulkamid\u00ae). The latest product, PDMS-U (Urolastic \u00ae) is a silicone gel that polymerizes when injected. The short term efficacy of UBAs are generally encouraging; however, longer follow up results show the success rates are reduced and many women will require a repeat treatment. This review looks at the currently available UBAs, application techniques, and the clinical data on their safety and efficacy."

Using our system, we specifically sever titin by digestion with TEV protease, and find that the response of muscle fibers to length changes requires mechanical transduction through titin's intact polypeptide chain. In addition, HaloTag-based covalent tethering enables examination of titin dynamics under force using magnetic tweezers. At pulling forces < 10\u2009pN, titin domains are recruited to the unfolded state, and produce 41.5\u2009zJ mechanical work during refolding.

These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology. "

We identified a total of 4060 differentially expressed circRNAs (1990 upregulated and 2070 downregulated) in Alzheimer's disease patients. Among these circRNAs, 10 randomly selected circRNAs were verified using qRT-PCR. The top 10 upregulated and downregulated circRNAs were used to predict their target miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were strongly associated with inflammation, metabolism, and immune responses, which are all risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was most involved in the MAPK, mTOR, AMPK, and WNT signaling pathways in Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated the importance of circRNAs in Alzheimer's disease development. Future studies will evaluate some of these circRNAs as biomarkers for early disease detection and to develop therapeutic strategies to clinically control Alzheimer's disease progression."

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 139 pregnant women with 3 or more RPL and thrombophilia. The relationship between pregnancy outcome and dynamic changes of URa-RI was analyzed in 116 women who delivered a liveborn infant and 23 who miscarried the index pregnancy. Patients were on preconception low molecular weight heparin, low-dose aspirin (81mg per day), and prednisone treatment. URa-RI was measured during periovulation time, at the time of positive pregnancy test, and then repeated every two weeks until 32-week gestation or the time of miscarriage. The URa-RI at 8-week gestation was significantly higher in women who miscarried the index pregnancy than those who delivered alive born infant (0.51\u00b10.08 vs. 0.42\u00b10.03, P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that URa-RI of 8 wk gestation effectively distinguished women who miscarried from those who had a live birth with an area under the curve of 82.6% (95% CI 69.01-97.17).

Exaggerated overproduction of aldosterone from ZG cells causes primary hyperaldosteronism. In ZG cells, calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels plays a central role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion. Previous studies in animal adrenals and human adrenocortical cell lines suggest that the T-type but not the L-type calcium channel activity drives aldosterone production. However, recent clinical studies show that somatic mutations in L-type calcium channels are the second most prevalent cause of aldosterone-producing adenoma. Our objective was to define the roles of T and L-type calcium channels in regulating aldosterone secretion from human adrenals. We find that human adrenal ZG cells mainly express T-type CaV3.2 /3.3 and L-type CaV1.2/1.3 calcium channels. TTA-P2, a specific inhibitor of T-type calcium channel subtypes, reduced basal aldosterone secretion from acutely prepared slices of human adrenals. Surprisingly, nifedipine, the prototypic inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, also decreased basal aldosterone secretion, suggesting that L-type calcium channels are active under basal conditions. In addition, TTA-P2 or nifedipine also inhibited aldosterone secretion stimulated by angiotensin II- or elevations in extracellular K+. Remarkably, blockade of either L- or T-type calcium channels inhibits basal and stimulated aldosterone production to a similar extent. Low concentrations of TTA-P2 and nifedipine showed additive inhibitory effects on aldosterone secretion. We conclude that T- and L-type calcium channels play equally important roles in controlling aldosterone production from human adrenals."

Heart failure is the terminal manifestation of cardiovascular diseases, and its morbidity and mortality remain high. The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) among heart failure patients remains uncertain. However, recent studies have found that it ranged from 40 to 71%. There is still no effective treatment for HFpEF. Thyroid hormones (TH) have central regulatory actions in the cardiovascular system, particularly in the heart. Changes in plasmatic or tissue thyroid hormone levels are associated with significant alterations in cardiovascular function. A significant proportion of patients with heart failure presents some form of thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and low T3 syndrome. Furthermore, thyroid hormones can vary at a local level independently of the serum TH levels. This may lead to local cardiac hypothyroidism in heart failure. Based on these findings and the role that TH play in cardiovascular regulation, they were proposed as a potential target for heart failure therapy. Several clinical and experimental studies have shown beneficial effects of TH supplementation. Data from epidemiological studies supports a higher risk of heart failure and a worse prognosis in heart failure patients with low levels of TH. In addition, animal studies and small clinical studies suggest that TH supplementation may improve cardiac function in heart failure. Although further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TH in this context, the available evidence suggests that TH modulation is a promising therapeutic approach to heart failure."

Our aim in this review is to highlight the recent progress in ET research. The ET-like domain peptide, corresponding to prepro-ET-193-166 , has been proposed to be co-synthesized and released with ET-1, to modulate the actions of the peptide. ET-1 remains the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system with a particularly long-lasting action. To date, the major therapeutic strategy to block the unwanted actions of ET in disease, principally in pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been to use antagonists that are selective for the ETA receptor (ambrisentan) or that block both receptor subtypes (bosentan). Macitentan represents the next generation of antagonists, being more potent than bosentan, with longer receptor occupancy and it is converted to an active metabolite; properties contributing to greater pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic efficacy. A second strategy is now being more widely tested in clinical trials and uses combined inhibitors of ET-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase such as SLV306 (daglutril). A third strategy based on activating the ETB receptor, has led to the renaissance of the modified peptide agonist IRL1620 as a clinical candidate in delivering anti-tumour drugs and as a pharmacological tool to investigate experimental pathophysiological conditions. Finally, we discuss biased signalling, epigenetic regulation and targeting with monoclonal antibodies as prospective new areas for ET research. "

In this study, we investigated genetic variants from seven OSCC risk loci identified in non-African populations for association with OSCC in the South African Black population. We performed association studies in a total of 1471 cases and 1791 controls from two study sample groups, which included 591 cases and 852 controls from the Western Cape and 880 cases and 939 controls from the Johannesburg region in the Gauteng province. Thereafter, we performed a meta-analysis for 11 variants which had been genotyped in both studies. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the CHEK2 gene, rs1033667, was significantly associated with OSCC [P = 0.002; odds ratio (OR) = 1.176; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.30]. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CASP8/ALS2CR12, TMEM173, PLCE1, ALDH2, ATP1B2/TP53 and RUNX1 loci were not associated with the disease (P > 0.05). The lack of association of six of these loci with OSCC in South African populations may reflect different genetic risk factors in non-African and African populations or differences in the genetic architecture of African genomes. The association at CHEK2, a gene with key roles in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, in an African population provides further support for the contribution of common genetic variants at this locus to the risk of oesophageal cancer."

Clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal diseases in children with autism spectrum disorders may be different from neurotypical children. Most of the evidence suggests that gastrointestinal dysfunction is more common in ASD children than in the typically developing group. Diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders in an autistic group of patients may be complicated and delayed. An important problem is their diagnosis, as most patients with autism are unable to inform their parents and/or carers about the suffering of abdominal pain or discomfort caused by bowel dysfunction. These symptoms may be a change in behavior: hyperactivity, anxiety, aggression, self-mutilation.

The A224E Gag mutant has no effect on cyclophilin A affinity but renders HIV-1 replication cyclosporine resistant in Jurkat T cells. In contrast, A224E mutant virus is dead in H9 T cells, although replication is rescued by cyclosporine or by expression in cis of a Gag mutant that decreases cyclophilin A-affinity. The observation that disruption of the Gag-cyclophilin A interaction rescues A224E mutant replication in H9 cells prompted experiments which revealed that, relative to Jurkat cells, H9 cells express greater quantities of cyclophilin A. The resulting larger quantity of cyclophilin A shown to be packaged into virions produced by H9 cells is presumably disruptive to the A224E mutant virion core. Further evidence that increased cyclophilin A expression in H9 cells is of functional relevance was provided by the finding that Gag mutants with decreased cyclophilin A affinity are dead in Jurkat cells but capable of replication in H9 cells. Similarly, cyclosporine concentrations which inhibit wild-type HIV-1 replication in Jurkat cells stimulate HIV-1 replication in H9 cells. These results suggest that HIV-1 virion infectivity imposes narrow constraints upon cyclophilin A stoichiometry in virions and that infectivity is finely tuned by host cyclophilin A expression levels."

Importantly, adenylyl cyclase types II, IV and VII have been reported to be activated by both Gs and Gi. Here, we demonstrate that rabbit erythrocytes possess an adenylyl cyclase subtype that is activated both by the alpha subunit and the betagamma subunit of Gs and Gi, respectively. Washed rabbit erythrocytes released ATP when exposed to the beta adrenergic receptor-mediated activator of Gs, isoproterenol (ISO, 10 microM, n = 8, p < 0.05) as well as in response to incubation with a direct activator of Gi, mastoparan 7 (MAS7, 10 microM, n = 12, p < 0.05). In contrast, an inactive mastoparan derivative, mastoparan 17 (MAS 17, 10 microM, n = 6) did not stimulate ATP release. Importantly, incubation of washed rabbit erythrocytes with either isoprotenerol (ISO) (10 microM, n = 7) or MAS7 (10 microM, n = 11) resulted in increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (p < 0.01).Western analysis was used to determine if an adenylyl cyclase capable of being activated by both Gs and Gi was a component of rabbit erythrocyte membranes. We identified adenylyl cyclase type II with two antibodies generated against different epitopes of the protein. These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in rabbit erythrocytes, activation of either Gs or Gi results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase resulting in increases in cAMP leading, ultimately, to the release of ATP."

The results highlighted the key elements, especially inflammatory-related proteins and metabolites that played important roles in the development of DES.

Exploiting DNA damage repair defects via inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is becoming an attractive therapeutic option. The TOPARP-A clinical trial demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer. However, several unanswered questions regarding the use of olaparib remain: 1) How do we best stratify patients for olaparib treatment? 2) Where do we place olaparib in the treatment sequence paradigm? 3) Is there cross-resistance between olaparib and currently used therapies? Here, we tested putative cross-resistance between current therapies and olaparib in treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer models. Docetaxel-resistant cells exhibited robust resistance to olaparib which could be attributed to blunted PARP trapping in response to olaparib treatment. Upregulated ABCB1 mediates cross-resistance between taxanes and olaparib, which can be overcome through decreasing ABCB1 expression or inhibiting ABCB1 using elacridar or enzalutamide. We also show that combining olaparib with enzalutamide is more effective in olaparib-sensitive cells than either single agent. Our results demonstrate that cross-resistance between olaparib and other therapies could blunt response to treatment and highlight the need to develop strategies to maximize olaparib efficacy."

Nevertheless, several questions related to the diversity and organization of regulatory motifs in 5S rDNA remain to be addressed. The 5S rDNA unit is composed of a conserved 120\u00a0bp length coding region and an intergenic spacer (IGS) containing potential regulatory motifs (Poly-T, AT-rich and GC-rich) differing in number, redundancy and position along the IGS. The Cestrum species (Solanaceae) have large genomes (about 10\u00a0pg/1C) and conserved 2n\u2009=\u200916 karyotypes. Strikingly, these genomes show high diversity of heterochromatin distribution, variability in 35S rDNA loci and the occurrence of B chromosomes. However, the 5S rDNA loci are highly conserved in the proximal region of chromosome 8. Comparison of seventy-one IGS sequences in plants revealed several conserved motifs with potential regulatory function. The AT- and GC-rich domains appeared highly conserved in Cestrum chromosomes. The 5S genic and the GC-rich IGS probe produced FISH signals in both A (pair 8) and B chromosomes. The GC-rich domain presented a strong potential for regulation because it may be associated with CpG islands organization, as well as to hairpin and loop organization. Another interesting aspect was the ability of AT- and GC-rich motifs to produce non-heterochromatic CMA/DAPI signals. While the length of the 5S rDNA IGS region varied in size between the Cestrum species, the individual sequence motifs seem to be conserved suggesting their regulatory function. The most striking feature was the conserved GC-rich domain in Cestrum, which is recognized as a signature trait of the proximal region of chromosome pair 8."

The action mechanism of HFNC includes a decrease in nasopharyngeal resistance, washout of dead space, reduction in inflow of ambient air, and an increase in airway pressure. In preterm infants, HFNC can be used to prevent reintubation and initial noninvasive respiratory support after birth. In children, flow level adjustments are crucial considering their maximal efficacy and complications. Randomized controlled studies suggest that HFNC can be used in cases of moderate to severe bronchiolitis upon initial low-flow oxygen failure. HFNC can also reduce intubation and mechanical ventilation in children with respiratory failure. Several observational studies have shown that HFNC can be beneficial in acute asthma and other respiratory distress. Multicenter randomized studies are warranted to determine the feasibility and adherence of HFNC and continuous positive airway pressure in pediatric intensive care units. The development of clinical guidelines for HFNC, including flow settings, indications, and contraindications, device management, efficacy identification, and safety issues are needed, particularly in children."

A single-point mutation \u03b26(A3)Glu\u2192Val leads to sickling of red blood cells, which in turn causes a lack of oxygen supply to tissue and organs. Although sickle cell disease is well understood, treatment options are currently underdeveloped. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug is hydroxyurea, an inducer of fetal \u03b3-hemoglobin, which is known to have a higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobins and thus alleviates symptoms. In the search for better cures, Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) serve as models for monitoring success of induction of fetal \u03b3-hemoglobins and with recent advances in proteomics, MS has become the leading technique to determine globin expression. Similar to humans, Rhesus monkeys possess hemoglobin variants that have not been sufficiently characterized to initiate such a study. Therefore, we developed a combined bottom-up and top-down approach to identify and characterize novel hemoglobin variants of the umbilical cord blood of Rhesus monkeys. A total of four different variants were studied: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b31 and \u03b32. A new \u03b1- and \u03b2-hemoglobin variant was identified, and the two previously hypothesized \u03b3-hemoglobins were identified. In addition, glutathionylation of both \u03b3-hemoglobin variants at their cysteines has been characterized. The combined approach outperformed either bottom-up or top-down alone and can be used for characterization of unknown hemoglobin variants and their PTMs."

The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects and more potency compared to imatinib. However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA is poorly understood. The present study investigated the treatment effect of dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice. We further demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis. The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS treated with dasatinib. Our findings suggest that dasatinib exhibited treatment effects on CIA mice and that FLS are an important target cell of dasatinib treatment in autoimmune arthritis."

FAK likely plays important roles in regulation of cell adhesion to the substrate, as FAK is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that acts as a signal transduction molecule at sites of cell-substrate attachment, called focal adhesions. FAK has been suggested to play a role in the attachment of cells at adhesive micropatterns by affecting cell polarity.

However, the effect of STAT3 on translation is almost unknown. We demonstrated that STAT3 acts as a trans-acting factor for MLST8 gene expression and the protein level of mLST8, a core component of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2), positively regulates the mTORC1/2 downstream pathways. Suppression of STAT3 by siRNA attenuated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cap-dependent translation, and cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. In HCT116 cells, STAT3 knockdown-induced decreases in 4E-BP1 and AKT phosphorylation levels were further attenuated by MLST8 knockdown or recovered by mLST8 overexpression. STAT3 knockdown-induced G2/M phase arrest was partially restored by co-knockdown of 4EBP1, and the attenuation of cell proliferation was enhanced by the expression of an mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation-defective mutant of 4E-BP1. ChIP and promoter mapping using a luciferase reporter assay showed that the -951 to -894\u00a0bp of MLST8 promoter seems to include STAT3-binding site. Overall, these results suggest that STAT3-driven MLST8 gene expression regulates cap-dependent translation through 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in cancer cells."

Although the number of cases of myocardial infarction in the T2D population has been reduced by 25% over the last 10 years, the incidence of HF is continuously increasing, making it the most worrying diabetes complication. This strongly reinforces the urgent need for innovative therapeutic interventions to prevent cardiac dysfunction in T2D patients. To this end, epidemiological, imaging and animal studies have aimed to highlight the mechanisms involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Epidemiological observations clearly show that hyperglycaemia correlates with severity of cardiac dysfunction and mortality in T2D patients. Both animal and cellular studies have demonstrated that, in the context of diabetes, the heart loses its ability to utilize glucose, therefore leading to glucose overload in cardiomyocytes that, in turn, promotes oxidative stress, accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and chronic activation of the hexosamine pathway. These have all been found to activate apoptosis and to alter heart contractility, calcium signalling and mitochondrial function. Although, in the past, tight glycaemic control has failed to improve cardiac function in T2D patients, recent clinical trials have reported cardiovascular benefit with hypoglycaemic antidiabetic drugs of the SGLT2-inhibitor family. This review, based on clinical evidence from mechanistic studies as well as several large clinical trials, covers 15 years of research, and strongly supports the idea that hyperglycaemia and glucose overload play a central role in the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy."

In necrosomes, the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) of RIP3 and RIP1 forms amyloidal complex. But how the amyloidal necrosomes control RIP3 activation and cell necroptosis has not been determined. Here, we showed that RIP3 amyloid fibrils could further assemble into large fibrillar networks which presents as cellular puncta during necroptosis. A viral RHIM-containing necroptosis inhibitor M45 could form heteroamyloid with RIP3 in cells and prevent RIP3 puncta formation and cell necroptosis. We characterized mutual antagonism between RIP3-RHIM and M45-RHIM in necroptosis regulation, which was caused by distinct inter-filament interactions in RIP3, M45 amyloids revealed with atomic force microscopy. Moreover, double mutations Asn464 and Met468 in RIP3-RHIM to Asp disrupted RIP3 kinase-dependent necroptosis. While the mutant RIP3(N464D/M468D) could form amyloid as wild type upon necroptosis induction. Based on these results, we propose that RIP3 amyloid formation is required but not sufficient in necroptosis signaling, the ordered inter-filament assembly of RIP3 is critical in RIP3 amyloid mediated kinase activation and cell necroptosis."

Patients at a higher risk of recurrence can be identified by multigene prognostic classifiers such as the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay, 70-gene prognostic signature, PAM-50, 12-gene molecular score, and others. The 21-gene RS assay (Oncotype Dx\u2122, Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) has level I clinical evidence and is the most widely used multigene assay in North America. The RS assay is based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that can be performed on the RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. It evaluates the expression of 16 cancer-related genes developed based on a multi-step approach. Due to its ability to assess recurrence risk and predict potential benefit from chemotherapy, the assay is recommended for patients with node-negative, HR-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology clinical practice guidelines, and St. Gallen consensus panel guidelines. The RS assay has also been incorporated in the prognostic stage groups in the 8th edition of the American Joint Commission of Cancer staging manual in order to provide essential genomic information for optimal treatment decisions. This review will focus on the utility of the RS assay in HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients, including risk of distant and locoregional recurrence in node-negative and node-positive tumors, association with radiotherapy, special subtypes of breast cancer, practical issues related to selecting tumors for testing, and overview of the recently published TailorX (Trial Assigning IndividuaLized Options for treatment [Rx]) results."

A total of 387,608 current marijuana users were identified based on ICD-9 codes for marijuana use among hospitalized patients in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database between 2007 and 2011. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between marijuana use and heart failure, cardiac disease, stroke, and in-hospital mortality. All models were adjusted for age, gender, race, residential income, insurance, residential region, pain, and number of comorbidities. Among hospitalized patients, marijuana use was associated with a 60% increased odds of stroke (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.44-1.77) compared with non-users, but significantly reduced odds of heart failure (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.75-0.82), cardiac disease (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82-0.91), or in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.38-0.44). Among cancer patients, odds of in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced among marijuana users compared with non-users (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.35-0.55). Hospitalized marijuana users were more likely to experience a stroke compared with non-users, but less likely to experience in-hospital mortality. Prospective studies will be needed to better characterize the health effects of marijuana use, especially among older, sicker, and/or hospitalized patients. In the meantime, conversations regarding marijuana use/misuse may be warranted in the clinical setting in order for patients and healthcare providers to adequately weigh the anticipated benefits of marijuana use with potentially significant health risks."

Given the role of STXBP1 in exocytosis of neurotransmitters and other manifestations of dopamine dysregulation in patients with STXBP1-EIEE4, we suggest that in patients with STXBP1 encephalopathy, A-BRX might be the result of the involvement of dopaminergic circuits."

The elimination of mitochondria via autophagy, termed mitophagy, is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, a ubiquitin-dependent selective autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria, has been described here, for the first time, in urothelial cells from 25 bladder cancers in cattle infected by bovine papillomavirus (BPV). The expression of BPV-2 and BPV-13 E5 oncoprotein was detected by RT-PCR. Abnormal mitochondria delimited by expanding phagophores, were peculiar ultrastructural features of neoplastic urothelial cells. High levels of mitochondrial phosphorylated PINK1/parkin were observed in neoplastic urothelial cells infected by BPVs. Phosphoparkin interacted with mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and ubiquitin (Ub), which confirmed that Mfn2 is a parkin receptor at the mitochondrial level, where parkin interacted also with Ub. Furthermore, parkin established a complex that was comprised of optineurin, p62, LC3, laforin, and embryonic stem cell-expressed Ras (ERAS), that interacted with BPV E5 oncoprotein, and Bag3, which, in turn, regulated the formation of a complex composed of Hpc70/Hsp70, CHIP, an HSC70-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is conceivable that ERAS is involved in mitophagosome maturation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Bag3, in association with Hsc70/Hsp70, may contribute to the transport and degradation of CHIP-ubiquitinated cargo as this complex recognises ubiquitinated cargos and transports them to aggresomes to be degraded. Furthermore, Bag3 may be involved in mitophagosome formation as it interacted with synaptopodin 2, which is known to play a role in mitophagosome biogenesis."

We show that mice lacking the tubulin deglutamylase CCP5 (also known as AGBL5) do not form functional sperm. In these mice, spermatids accumulate polyglutamylated tubulin, accompanied by the occurrence of disorganized microtubule arrays, in particular in the sperm manchette. Spermatids further fail to re-arrange their intracellular space and accumulate organelles and cytosol, while nuclei condense normally. Strikingly, spermatids lacking CCP5 show supernumerary centrioles, suggesting that glutamylation could control centriole duplication. We show that most of these observed defects are also present in mice in which CCP5 is deleted only in the male germ line, strongly suggesting that they are germ-cell autonomous. Our findings reveal that polyglutamylation is, beyond its known importance for sperm flagella, an essential regulator of several microtubule-based functions during spermatogenesis. This makes enzymes involved in glutamylation prime candidates for being genes involved in male sterility."

Synapsin I, a neuronal phosphoprotein associated with small synaptic vesicles and cytoskeletal elements at the presynaptic terminals, is thought to be involved in modulating neurotransmitter release. The state of phosphorylation of synapsin I in vitro regulates its interaction with both synaptic vesicles and cytoskeletal components, including microtubules and microfilaments. Here we present the first evidence that in the mouse retinal ganglion cells most synapsin I is transported down the axon, together with the cytomatrix proteins, at the same rate as the slow component b of axonal transport, and is phosphorylated at both the head and tail regions. In addition, our data suggest that, after synapsin I has reached the nerve endings, the relative proportions of variously phosphorylated synapsin I molecules change, and that these changes lead to a decrease in the overall content of phosphorus. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in vivo, the phosphorylation of synapsin I along the axon prevents the formation of a dense network that could impair organelle movement. On the other hand, the dephosphorylation of synapsin I at the nerve endings may regulate the clustering of small synaptic vesicles and modulate neurotransmitter release by controlling the availability of small synaptic vesicles for exocytosis."

Approvals in GIST, and more recently in HCC, were based on the results from the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 GRID and RESORCE trials, respectively. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical evidence for approval of regorafenib in mCRC, GIST, and HCC, present emerging evidence of regorafenib activity in other tumor types (namely, gastroesophageal cancer, sarcomas, biliary tract cancer, and glioblastoma), and discuss trials in progress within the context of regorafenib's mechanism of action. We describe recent advances and key lessons learned with regorafenib, including the importance of managing common drug-related toxicities using dose-optimization strategies, the search for biomarkers to predict response to treatment, and highlight some of the unaddressed questions and future directions for regorafenib across tumors."

Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

SUMOylation, a crucial post-translational modification, exhibits a strong effect on DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, protein stability and cell cycle progression. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that SUMOylation is closely related to the development of liver disease. Therefore, the effects of SUMOylation in liver diseases, such as Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) were reviewed in this study. Specifically, SUMO1 was found to promote the invasion and metastasis of HCC and may promote hypoxia-mediated P65 nuclear transport while accelerating the progression of HCC. In addition, SUMO1-modified centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CAPA) was observed to be overexpressed in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC in response to TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. Furthermore, SUMOylated CAPA was found to induce HBX-triggered NF-\u03baB activation. Considering the diversity and significance of SUMOylation, targeting of the SUMOylation pathway may serve as an effective approach in the treatment of liver diseases."

As more oncologists begin to use rucaparib and other PARP inhibitors as part of routine clinical practice, awareness of possible side effects and how to adequately manage toxicities is crucial. In this review, we summarize the safety and tolerability of rucaparib reported in an integrated safety analysis that supported the FDA's initial approval of rucaparib in the treatment setting. Additionally, drawing on clinical data and our personal experience with rucaparib, we provide our recommendations on the management of common side effects observed with rucaparib, including anemia, blood creatinine elevations, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevations, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal-related events (e.g., nausea, vomiting), and asthenia and fatigue. These side effects, many of which appear to be class effects of PARP inhibitors, are often self-limiting and can be managed with adequate interventions such as treatment interruption and/or dose reduction and the use of supportive therapies. Supportive therapies may include blood transfusions for patients with anemia, prophylactic medications to prevent nausea and vomiting, or behavioral interventions to mitigate fatigue. Understanding and appropriate management of potential side effects associated with rucaparib may allow patients with ovarian cancer to continue to benefit from rucaparib treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Rucaparib was recently approved in the U.S. and European Union for use as treatment or maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer. This review focuses on the safety and tolerability of rucaparib in the treatment setting. Similar side effects are observed in the maintenance setting. Drawing on the authors' clinical experience with rucaparib, rucaparib prescribing information, and published supportive cancer care guidelines, this review discusses how to optimally manage common rucaparib-associated side effects in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the real-world oncology setting. Adequate management of such side effects is crucial for allowing patients with ovarian cancer to remain on treatment to receive optimal efficacy benefit."

We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and consequent gene downregulation. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are\u00a0maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination."

Parasite genetic factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNV) have shown their role in drug resistance. Most of the studies have focused on the role of SNPs and drug resistance in parasite. However, it has also been showed that CNV is associated with adaptation and drug resistance in parasite. Hence, exploration of copy number polymorphism in essential genes of P. falciparum and their role in anti-malarial resistance are important. This review provides the recent information related to genetic profile of CNV marker in plasmepsin and other genes associated with drugresistanceinP. falciparum. It may be suggested that CNVs in plasmepsin genes are the major driver of piperaquine resistance. Moreover, CNV in pfcrt and pfmdr1genes appears to play important role in adaptation and hence survival of the parasite. It may be hypothesized that targeting of CNV formation in the parasite could be beneficial for breakdown of its adaption in response to drug pressure."

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to enhance many neutrophil functions such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, degranulation and cell survival via the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. ERK1/2 pathway activation is redox sensitive and could be modulated by ROS. In order to investigate whether NADPH oxidase NOX2-derived ROS could contribute to GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we tested the effect of two selective NOX2 inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. Results showed that, while both DPI and apocynin strongly inhibited neutrophil ROS production, only apocynin, but not DPI, inhibited GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that ROS are not involved in this process. Apocynin did not affect GM-CSF-induced p38MAPKinase phosphorylation, another redox sensitive kinase. Interestingly, apocynin inhibited GM-CSF-induced MEK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation without affecting fMLF-induced phosphorylation of these proteins. GM-CSF is known to inhibit neutrophils apoptosis and to promote cell survival via the AKT-ERK1/2 pathway. In this regard, we found that apocynin also inhibited GM-CSF-induced anti-apoptotic effect in neutrophils. These results suggest that NADPH oxidase NOX2-derived ROS are not involved in GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that apocynin inhibits GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway independently of its inhibitory action on NADPH oxidase NOX2. Thus, apocynin can exert an anti-inflammatory effect not only by limiting neutrophil ROS production but also by decreasing neutrophil survival at inflammatory site."

Purinergic receptors have been well studied in recent years using various molecular biological methods. The main research objective of this review is to determine the association of P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y6, P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors with neuropathic pain. This review includes the most comprehensive subtypes of P2Y that related to neuropathic pain and the current therapeutic method of neuropathic pain. G protein-coupled P2Y receptors are located on neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells and regulate neurotransmission. Nerve injury is the prime reason for abnormal regulation of P2Y receptor mRNA expression, subsequently, inducing neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain that is divided into peripheral, central and mixed. Numerous studies demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression level of P2Y receptors and neuropathic pain generation. Also, several reports showed that P2Y short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and P2Y antagonist can be used as an analgesic to relieve neuropathic pain via decreasing P2Y receptor expression level and neural cell activation. However, the transformation process from basic experiments to clinical applications is a long process. Current deficiencies and future research directions are discussed at the end of this review."

Using telomeric chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we detected BRCA1 at the telomere and demonstrated time-dependent loss of BRCA1 from the telomere following DNA damage. Further studies suggest that BRCA1 interacts with TRF1 and TRF2 in a DNA-dependent manner and that some of the nuclear BRCA1 colocalizes with TRF1/2. Our findings further suggest that Rad50 is required to localize BRCA1 at the telomere and that the association of BRCA1 with Rad50 does not require DNA. Finally, we found that BRCA1 regulates the length of the 3' G-rich overhang in a manner that is dependent upon Rad50. Our findings suggest that BRCA1 is recruited to the telomere in a Rad50-dependent manner and that BRCA1 may regulate telomere length and stability, in part through its presence at the telomere."

In the eukaryotic and archaeal kingdoms, however, recycling involves the ABC-type ATPase ABCE1 and little is known about its structural basis. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of eukaryotic and archaeal ribosome recycling complexes containing ABCE1 and the termination factor paralogue Pelota. These structures reveal the overall binding mode of ABCE1 to be similar to canonical translation factors. Moreover, the iron-sulphur cluster domain of ABCE1 interacts with and stabilizes Pelota in a conformation that reaches towards the peptidyl transferase centre, thus explaining how ABCE1 may stimulate peptide-release activity of canonical termination factors. Using the mechanochemical properties of ABCE1, a conserved mechanism in archaea and eukaryotes is suggested that couples translation termination to recycling, and eventually to re-initiation."

Molecular genetic analysis provides a genetic diagnosis in approximately 60% of individuals with clinical OA/OCA. A considerably number of the remaining 40% are heterozygous for a causative sequence variation in TYR. To identify missing causative sequence variants in these, we used a NGS based approach, genotyping and segregation analysis. We report two putative pathogenic haplotypes which only differ by two extremely rare SNVs, indicating that the haplotypes have a common derivation. Both haplotypes segregate consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and include the allele p.S192Y-p.R402Q. An explanation for the pathogenicity of the haplotypes could be the combination of p.S192Y and p.R402Q. Homozygosity for the pathogenic haplotypes causes a partial albinism phenotype. In our cohort, 15% of affected individuals had a molecular genetic diagnosis involving the pathogenic haplotype. Consequently, the prevalence of albinism seems to be substantially underestimated, and children with unexplained bilateral subnormal vision and/or nystagmus should be analysed clinically and molecularly for albinism."

Mutation of the TERT promoter is one of the most common genetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating that TERT upregulation is a critical event in hepatocarcinogenesis. Regulators of TERT transcription are, therefore, predicted to be plausible targets for HCC treatment. We undertook a genome-wide shRNA library screen and identified C15orf55 and C7orf43 as regulators of TERT expression in HepG2 cells. Promoter assays showed that C15orf55- and C7orf43-responsive sites exist between base pairs -58 and +36 and -169 and -59 in the TERT promoter, respectively. C15orf55 upregulates TERT expression by binding to two GC motifs in the SP1 binding site of the TERT promoter. C7orf43 upregulates TERT expression through Yes-associated protein 1. The expression levels of C15orf55 and C7orf43 also correlated with that of TERT, and were significantly increased in both HCC tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues, compared to normal liver tissues from non-HCC patients. Analysis of 377 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that overall survival of patients with low levels of C15orf55 and C7orf43 expression in tumor tissues was better compared with patients with high levels of C15orf55 and/or high C7orf43 expression. These results indicate that C15orf55 and C7orf43 are involved in the incidence and progression of HCC by upregulating TERT. In conclusion, we identified C15orf55 and C7orf43 as positive regulators of TERT expression in HCC tissues. These genes are promising targets for HCC treatment."

Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses. "

These cells express a small endogenous erg current known to be reduced by TRH. GH3/B6 cells were injected with cDNA coding for rat erg1, erg2, erg3 and HERG K+ channels. The corresponding erg currents were isolated with the help of the specific erg channel blockers E-4031 and dofetilide and their biophysical properties were determined. TRH (1 M) was able to significantly reduce the different erg currents. The voltage dependence of activation was shifted by 15 mV (erg1), 10 mV (erg2) and 6 mV (erg3) to more positive potentials without strongly affecting erg inactivation. TRH reduced the maximal available erg current amplitude by 12% (erg1), 13% (erg2) and 39% (erg3) and accelerated the time course of erg1 and erg2 channel deactivation, whereas erg3 deactivation kinetics were not significantly altered. The effects of TRH on HERG currents did not differ from those on its rat homologue erg1. In addition, coinjection of rat MiRP1 with HERG cDNA did not influence the TRH-induced modulation of HERG channels. Rat erg1 currents recorded in the cell-attached configuration were reduced by application of TRH to the extra-patch membrane in the majority of the experiments, confirming the involvement of a diffusible second messenger. Application of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1 M) shifted the voltage dependence of erg1 activation in the depolarizing direction, but it did not reduce the maximal current amplitude. The voltage shift could not be explained by a selective effect on protein kinase C (PKC) since the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I did not block the effects of TRH and PMA on erg1. In addition, cholecystokinin, known to activate the phosphoinositol pathway similarly to TRH, did not significantly affect the erg1 current. Various agents interfering with different known TRH-elicited cellular responses were not able to completely mimic or inhibit the TRH effects on erg1. Tested substances included modulators of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, arachidonic acid, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, sodium nitroprusside and cytochalasin D. The results demonstrate that all three members of the erg channel subfamily are modulated by TRH in GH3/B6 cells. In agreement with previous studies on the TRH-induced modulation of the endogenous erg current in prolactin-secreting anterior pituitary cells, the TRH effects on overexpressed erg1 channels are not mediated by any of the tested signalling pathways."

Displaying activity in multiple solid tumors, it has been approved in differentiated thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma as single agent or in combination. In addition, lenvatinib has shown promise in several other tumor types including medullary, anaplastic thyroid, adenoid cystic, and endometrial cancer. Exploring synergy between angiogenic and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the lenvatinib/pembrolizumab combination is poised to become the next pair of active drugs in endometrial, lung, and gastrointestinal malignancies. Despite robust activity, the drug can be difficult to tolerate. Optimization of dose and biomarkers for prediction of efficacy and toxicities will be of great help. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Readers will be presented with an update on U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of lenvatinib and suggestions for off-label use in thyroid cancer and adenoid cystic carcinomas. They will become familiarized with the common side effects, frequency, and predicators of response. In addition, they will learn that different strengths of lenvatinib are prescribed and why. Finally, readers are pointed to the latest efforts to combine lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, as well as to unresolved issues such as long-term side effects/toxicities of this drug."

Decreasing the levels of cellular polyamines stabilizes JunD mRNA without affecting its transcription, but the exact mechanism whereby polyamines regulate JunD mRNA degradation has not been elucidated. RNA-binding proteins HuR and AUF1 associate with labile mRNAs bearing AU-rich elements located in the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) and modulate their stability. Here, we show that JunD mRNA is a target of HuR and AUF1 and that polyamines modulate JunD mRNA degradation by altering the competitive binding of HuR and AUF1 to the JunD 3'-UTR. The depletion of cellular polyamines enhanced HuR binding to JunD mRNA and decreased the levels of JunD transcript associated with AUF1, thus stabilizing JunD mRNA. The silencing of HuR increased AUF1 binding to the JunD mRNA, decreased the abundance of HuR-JunD mRNA complexes, rendered the JunD mRNA unstable, and prevented increases in JunD mRNA and protein in polyamine-deficient cells. Conversely, increasing the cellular polyamines repressed JunD mRNA interaction with HuR and enhanced its association with AUF1, resulting in an inhibition of JunD expression. These results indicate that polyamines modulate the stability of JunD mRNA in intestinal epithelial cells through HuR and AUF1 and provide new insight into the molecular functions of cellular polyamines."

CTCF-associated domain boundaries were dispensable for RT. CTCF protein depletion weakened most TAD boundaries but had no effect on RT or A/B compartmentalization genome-wide. By contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites caused a domain-wide early-to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The dispensability of TAD boundaries and the\u00a0necessity of these \"early replication control elements\" (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and inversions at additional domains.

The addition of the SOFA score to the biomarker combination did not result in a better performance for the prediction of mortality.The combined biomarker approach showed good performance in predicting 28-day all-cause mortality among patients diagnosed with either sepsis or septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions.

The enzyme harbors an FAD cofactor that is covalently attached to histidine 103 via an 8\u03b1-N(3) histidyl linkage. Our previous work showed that variant H103Y was still able to bind FAD (non-covalently) and perform catalysis but steady-state kinetic parameters for several substrates were negatively affected. In order to investigate the impact of the covalent FAD attachment in Agaricus meleagris PDH in more detail, pre-steady-state kinetics, reduction potential and stability of the variant H103Y in comparison to the wild-type enzyme were probed. Stopped-flow analysis revealed that the mutation slowed down the reductive half-reaction by around three orders of magnitude whereas the oxidative half-reaction was affected only to a minor degree. This was reflected by a decrease in the standard reduction potential of variant H103Y compared to the wild-type protein. The existence of an anionic semiquinone radical in the resting state of both the wild-type and variant H103Y was demonstrated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and suggested a higher mobility of the cofactor in the variant H103Y. Unfolding studies showed significant negative effects of the disruption of the covalent bond on thermal and conformational stability. The results are discussed with respect to the role of covalently bound FAD in catalysis and stability. "

However, it is less effective in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer, and the reason for this discrepancy is not yet fully elucidated. By RNA sequencing analysis, we identified vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (VCAM-1) to be highly upregulated in both time- and dose-dependent manners during BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) in a BRAF-mutant papillary thyroid cancer cell line (BCPAP). Cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays showed that knockdown of the induced VCAM-1 in BCPAP cells augmented the antitumor effects of vemurafenib, with decreased IC50 values of 1.4 to 0.8\u00a0\u03bcM. Meanwhile, overexpression of VCAM-1 in a BRAF-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line (FRO) reduced the sensitivity to vemurafenib, with increased IC50 values of 1.9 to 5.8\u00a0\u03bcM. Further investigation showed that PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway was activated during BRAFi. Co-treatment with Akt signaling inhibitor MK2206 decreased the induced expression of VCAM-1 during BRAFi. This combination further improved the efficacy of vemurafenib. Moreover, VCAM-1 promoted migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells in vitro, which was also indicated in thyroid cancer patients. The present study is the first to demonstrate that VCAM-1 is upregulated in thyroid cancer cells treated with vemurafenib and contributes to vemurafenib resistance in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells. Targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway-mediated VCAM-1 response may be an alternative strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers to vemurafenib."

Musclin possesses a region homologous to the natriuretic peptide family. Thus, musclin is found to bind with the natriuretic peptide clearance receptors. However, the role of musclin in vascular regulation remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the direct effect of musclin on vascular tone and to analyze its role in hypertension using the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In aortic strips isolated from SHR, musclin induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. We found that the musclin-induced vasoconstriction was more marked in SHR than in normal rats (WKY). Moreover, this contraction was reduced by blockade of natriuretic peptide receptor C using the ab14355 antibody. Therefore, mediation of the natriuretic peptide receptor in musclin-induced vasoconstriction can be considered. In addition, similar to the natriuretic peptide receptor, expression of the musclin gene in blood vessels was higher in SHR than in WKY. Injection of musclin markedly increased the blood pressure in rats that can be inhibited by anti-musclin antibodies. Musclin-induced vasoconstriction was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY as in its expression. Taken together, these results suggest that musclin is involved in blood pressure regulation. The higher expression of musclin in hypertension indicates that musclin could be used as a new target for the treatment of hypertension in the future. "

The porphyrias are classified into three major categories: 1) the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs), including Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), Hereditary Coproporphyria (HCP), Variegate Porphyria (VP), and 5-Aminolevlulinic Acid Dehydratase Deficient Porphyria (ADP); 2) a hepatic cutaneous porphyria, Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT); and 3) the cutaneous erythropoietic porphyrias, Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP), Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP), and X-Linked Protoporphyria (XLP). Their modes of inheritance include autosomal dominant with markedly decreased penetrance (AIP, VP, and HCP), autosomal recessive (ADP, CEP, and EPP), or X-linked (XLP), as well as an acquired sporadic form (PCT). There are severe homozygous dominant forms of the three AHPs. For each porphyria, its phenotype, inheritance pattern, unique genetic principles, and molecular genetic heterogeneity are presented. To date, >1000 mutations in the heme biosynthetic genes causing their respective porphyrias have been reported, including low expression alleles and genotype/phenotype correlations that predict severity for certain porphyrias.

Additionally, F. fujikuroi is able to produce a variety of polyketide- and non-ribosomal peptide-derived metabolites such as bikaverins, fusarubins and fusarins as well as metabolites from yet unidentified biosynthetic pathways, e.g. moniliformin. The key enzymes needed for their production belong to the family of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) that are generally known to be post-translationally modified by a Sfp-type 4'phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). In this study we provide evidence that the F. fujikuroi Sfp-type PPTase FfPpt1 is essentially involved in lysine biosynthesis and production of bikaverins, fusarubins and fusarins, but not moniliformin as shown by analytical methods. Concomitantly, targeted Ffppt1 deletion mutants reveal an enhancement of terpene-derived metabolites like GAs and volatile substances such as \u03b1-acorenol. Pathogenicity assays on rice roots using fluorescent labeled wild-type and Ffppt1 mutant strains indicate that lysine biosynthesis and iron acquisition but not PKS and NRPS metabolism is essential for establishment of primary infections of F. fujikuroi. Additionally, FfPpt1 is involved in conidiation and sexual mating recognition possibly by activating PKS- and/or NRPS-derived metabolites that could act as diffusible signals. Furthermore, the effect on iron acquisition of Ffppt1 mutants led us to identify a previously uncharacterized putative third reductive iron uptake system (FfFtr3/FfFet3) that is closely related to the FtrA/FetC system of A. fumigatus. Functional characterization provides evidence that both proteins are involved in iron acquisition and are liable to transcriptional repression of the homolog of the Aspergillus GATA-type transcription factor SreA under iron-replete conditions. Targeted deletion of the first Fusarium homolog of this GATA-type transcription factor-encoding gene, Ffsre1, strongly indicates its involvement in regulation of iron homeostasis and oxidative stress resistance."

Further, ectopic overexpression of miR-149 by transfecting miR-149 mimics significantly inhibited growth, migration and invasion of HSCLCs, which was found to be mediated through FOXM1. Moreover, miR-149 overexpression decreases the viability and proliferation of HSCLCs.

Specific gene mutations, structural rearrangements, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression profiles are now recognized to define molecular subgroups of gliomas that arise in distinct anatomic locations and patient age groups, and also provide a better prediction of clinical outcomes for glioma patients compared to histologic assessment alone. Understanding the role of these distinctive genetic alterations in gliomagenesis is also important for the development of potential targeted therapeutic interventions. Mutations including K27M and G34R/V that affect critical amino acids within the N-terminal tail of the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1 (encoded by H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes), are prime examples of mutations in diffuse gliomas with characteristic clinical associations that can help diagnostic classification and guide effective patient management. These histone H3 mutations frequently co-occur with inactivating mutations in ATRX in association with alternative lengthening of telomeres. Telomere length can also be maintained through upregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression driven by mutation within the TERT gene promoter region, an alteration most commonly found in oligodendrogliomas and primary glioblastomas arising in adults. Interestingly, the genetic alterations perturbing histone and telomere function in pediatric gliomas tend to be different from those present in adult tumors. We present a review of these mutations affecting the histone code and telomere length, highlighting their importance in prognosis and as targets for novel therapeutics in the treatment of diffuse gliomas."

                    "context": "Replicative DNA helicases expose the two strands of the double helix to the replication apparatus, but accessory helicases are often needed to help forks move past naturally occurring hard-to-replicate sites, such as tightly bound proteins, RNA/DNA hybrids, and DNA secondary structures. Although the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 5'-to-3' DNA helicase Pfh1 is known to promote fork progression, its genomic targets, dynamics, and mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry. Of the 621 high confidence Pfh1-binding sites in wild type cells, about 40% were sites of fork slowing (as marked by high DNA polymerase occupancy) and/or DNA damage (as marked by high levels of phosphorylated H2A). The replication and integrity of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes, and nucleosome depleted regions were particularly Pfh1-dependent. The association of Pfh1 with genomic integrity at highly transcribed genes was S phase dependent, and thus unlikely to be an artifact of high transcription rates. Although Pfh1 affected replication and suppressed DNA damage at discrete sites throughout the genome, Pfh1 and the replicative DNA polymerase bound to similar extents to both Pfh1-dependent and independent sites, suggesting that Pfh1 is proximal to the replication machinery during S phase. Consistent with this interpretation, Pfh1 co-purified with many key replisome components, including the hexameric MCM helicase, replicative DNA polymerases, RPA, and the processivity clamp PCNA in an S phase dependent manner. Thus, we conclude that Pfh1 is an accessory DNA helicase that interacts with the replisome and promotes replication and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. These data provide insight into mechanisms by which this evolutionarily conserved helicase helps preserve genome integrity."

In\u00a0Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Asf1 interacts functionally with a second chaperone, Vps75, and the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) Rtt109. Both Asf1 and Vps75 can increase the specificity of histone acetylation by Rtt109, but neither alter selectivity. However, changes in acetylation selectivity have been observed in histones extracted from cells, which contain a plethora of post-translational modifications. In the present study, we use a series of singly acetylated histones to test the hypothesis that histone pre-acetylation and histone chaperones function together to drive preferential acetylation of H3K56. We show that pre-acetylated H3K14ac/H4 functions with Asf1 to drive specific acetylation of H3K56 by Rtt109-Vps75. Additionally, we identified an exosite containing an acidic patch in Asf1 and show that mutations to this region alter Asf1-mediated crosstalk that changes Rtt109-Vps75 selectivity. Our proposed mechanism suggests that Gcn5 acetylates H3K14, recruiting remodeler complexes, allowing for the Asf1-H3K14ac/H4 complex to be acetylated at H3K56 by Rtt109-Vps75. This mechanism explains the conflicting biochemical data and the genetic links between Rtt109, Vps75, Gcn5\u00a0and Asf1 in the acetylation of H3K56."

As such, a forensic autopsy series described focal liver lesions in about 50\u200a% of all examined men between 35 and 69 years of age with an increasing incidence for older people. In the diagnostic work-up of unclear liver lesions, a careful distinction between lesions that occur in asymptomatic and healthy individuals and are benign in over 95\u200a% of cases, and lesion found in patients with pre-existing malignant, inflammatory or cirrhotic disease must be made. The main goal in the diagnosis of unclear liver lesions is to prove the benignity of the lesion and to exclude a malignant cause as reliably as possible. In case of benign lesions, an attempt should be made to achieve an exact classification. The most common benign focal liver lesions include liver cysts, focal fatty liver deposition or sparing, haemangiomas, focal calcifications, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), nodular regenerative hyperplasia, biliary hamartomas (von-Meyenburg complexes) and hepatocellular adenomas. Abscesses, inflammatory infiltrations or pseudotumors as well as sites of extramedullary haematopoiesis are observed much less frequently. Among the most frequent malignant focal liver lesions are metastases of other tumor entities such as colorectal cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA).

In this IWGT review, we consider the role of aneuploidy in cancer biology; cancer risk associated with constitutive aneuploidy; rodent carcinogenesis with known chemical aneugens; and chemotherapy-related malignant neoplasms. Aneuploidy is seen at various stages in carcinogenesis. However, the relationship between induced aneuploidy occurring after exposure and clonal aneuploidy present in tumours is not clear. Recent evidence indicates that the induction of chromosomal instability (CIN), may be more important than aneuploidy per se, in the carcinogenic process. Down Syndrome, trisomy 21, is associated with altered hematopoiesis in utero which, in combination with subsequent mutations, results in an increased risk for acute megakaryoblastic and lymphoblastic leukemias. In contrast, there is reduced cancer risk for most solid tumours in Down Syndrome. Mouse models with high levels of aneuploidy are also associated with increased cancer risk for particular tumours with long latencies, but paradoxically other types of tumour often show decreased incidence. The aneugens reviewed that induce cancer in humans and animals all possess other carcinogenic properties, such as mutagenicity, clastogenicity, cytotoxicity, organ toxicities, hormonal and epigenetic changes which likely account for, or interact with aneuploidy, to cause carcinogenesis. Although the role that aneuploidy plays in carcinogenesis has not been fully established, in many cases, it may not play a primary causative role. Tubulin-disrupting aneugens that do not possess other properties linked to carcinogenesis, were not carcinogenic in rodents. Similarly, in humans, for the tubulin-disrupting aneugens colchicine and albendazole, there is no reported association with increased cancer risk. There is a need for further mechanistic studies on agents that induce aneuploidy, particularly by mechanisms other than tubulin disruption and to determine the role of aneuploidy in pre-neoplastic events and in early and late stage neoplasia."

Loss of PCSK9 induces the increase of LDLR levels and reduction of plasma LDL-C. Here, we developed a novel style of artificial platelets with biomimetic properties, high stability, and long circulation, which enabled the efficient delivery of siRNA targeting Pcsk9. The bioinspired nanoparticles induced Pcsk9 mRNA reduction by 66% in vitro. For in vivo studies, the nanoparticles accumulated in the liver to reduce Pcsk9 transcription, which results in ~28% reduction in plasma LDL-C concentrations, with negligible effects on either high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or triglycerides (TGs). These results demonstrated the use of artificial platelets to deliver siRNA and induce effective RNAi therapeutics to specifically lower LDL-C, which provides a potential strategy to lower PCSK9 and treat hypercholesterolemia."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is among the most common rare pediatric disorders, and clinical trials of therapeutic approaches have seen dramatic expansion. Pharmacotherapeutic standard of care has been limited to off-label prescription of high-dose, daily corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort). Deflazacort received FDA approval for DMD in 2016, although the price increases associated with formal FDA approval and the severe side effects associated with corticosteroid use have limited patient/physician uptake and insurance coverage in the USA. In Europe, EMA has given conditional marketing authorization for prescription of Translarna (a stop codon read-through drug prescribed to ~10% of DMD patients), although there is not yet evidence of clinical efficacy. The FDA awarded conditional approval to etiplirsen, an exon-skipping oligonucleotide drug, based on accelerated pathways (increased dystrophin production in patient muscle). Evidence of clinical efficacy remains the focus of post-marketing studies. There are many innovative pharmacotherapies under clinical development for DMD (Phase I, II, and III clinical trials). All are \"disease modifying\" in the sense that none seek to replace the full-length, normal DMD gene or dystrophin protein, but instead either seek to introduce an abnormal \"Becker-like\" version of the gene or protein or target pathophysiological pathways downstream of the primary defect. It is envisioned that the most significant benefit to DMD patients will be through multidrug approaches simultaneously aiming to introduce partially functional dystrophin in patient muscle while also targeting both chronic inflammation and the fibrofatty replacement of muscle."

We investigated patterns of 5mC and 5hmC during neurogenesis in the embryonic mouse brain. 5hmC levels increase during neuronal differentiation. In neuronal cells, 5hmC is not enriched at enhancers but associates preferentially with gene bodies of activated neuronal function-related genes. Within these genes, gain of 5hmC is often accompanied by loss of H3K27me3. Enrichment of 5hmC is not associated with substantial DNA demethylation, suggesting that 5hmC is a stable epigenetic mark. Functional perturbation of the H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 or of Tet2 and Tet3 leads to defects in neuronal differentiation, suggesting that formation of 5hmC and loss of H3K27me3 cooperate to promote brain development."

Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is vital for brain formation and cognitive function. ADNP deficiency in mice causes pathological Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, correlated with impaired cognitive functions. It has been previously shown that the ADNP-derived peptide NAP protects against ADNP deficiency, exhibiting neuroprotection, MT interaction and memory protection. NAP prevents MT degradation by recruitment of Tau and end-binding proteins to MTs and expression of these proteins is required for NAP activity. Clinically, NAP (davunetide, CP201) exhibited efficacy in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients (Tau3R/4R tauopathy) but not in progressive supranuclear palsy (increased Tau4R tauopathy). Here, we examined the potential preferential interaction of NAP with 3R vs. 4R Tau, toward personalized treatment of tauopathies. Affinity-chromatography showed that NAP preferentially interacted with Tau3R protein from rat brain extracts and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay indicated that NAP induced increased recruitment of human Tau3R to MTs under zinc intoxication, in comparison to Tau4R. Furthermore, we showed that NAP interaction with tubulin (MTs) was inhibited by obstruction of Tau-binding sites on MTs, confirming the requirement of Tau-MT interaction for NAP activity. The preferential interaction of NAP with Tau3R may explain clinical efficacy in mixed vs. Tau4R pathologies, and suggest effectiveness in Tau3R neurodevelopmental disorders."

The results reveal that: (1) low recombination domains and blocks of elevated linkage disequilibrium tend to coincide with TADs and isochores, indicating co-evolving regulatory elements and genes in insulated neighbourhoods; (2) double strand break (DSB) and recombination frequencies increase in the short loops of GC-rich TADs, whereas recombination cold spots are typical of LADs and (3) the binding and loading of proteins, which are critical for DSB and meiotic recombination (SPO11, DMC1, H3K4me3 and PRMD9) are higher in GC-rich TADs. One explanation for these observations is that the occurrence of DSB and recombination in meiotic cells are associated with compositional and epigenetic features (genomic code) that influence DNA stiffness/flexibility and appear to be similar to those guiding the chromatin architecture in the interphase nucleus of pre-leptotene cells."

Ongoing clinical trials with A\u03b2 antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab) seem to be promising, while vaccines against the tau protein (AADvac1 and ACI-35) are now in early-stage trials. Interesting results have also been achieved in trials involving small molecules such as inhibitors of \u03b2-secretase (MK-8931, E2609), a combination of 5-HT6 antagonist (idalopirdine) with donepezil, inhibition of advanced glycation end product receptors by azeliragon or modulation of the acetylcholine response of \u03b1-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by encenicline. Development of new effective drugs acting upon the central nervous system is usually a difficult and time-consuming process, and in the case of AD to-date clinical trials have had a very high failure rate.

Increasing evidence shows that epigenetic alterations play an important role in human carcinogenesis. Deregulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications have recently been characterized in HCC, but the significance of chromatin remodeling in liver carcinogenesis remains to be explored. In this study, by systematically analyzing the expression of chromatin remodeling genes in human HCCs, we found that helicase, lymphoid-specific (HELLS), an SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling enzyme, was remarkably overexpressed in HCC. Overexpression of HELLS correlated with more aggressive clinicopathological features and poorer patient prognosis compared to patients with lower HELLS expression. We further showed that up-regulation of HELLS in HCC was conferred by hyperactivation of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1). To investigate the functions of HELLS in HCC, we generated both gain-of-function and loss-of-function models by the CRISPR activation system, lentiviral short hairpin RNA, and the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. We demonstrated that overexpression of HELLS augmented HCC cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, depletion of HELLS reduced HCC growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, inactivation of HELLS led to metabolic reprogramming and reversed the Warburg effect in HCC cells. Mechanistically, by integrating analysis of RNA sequencing and micrococcal nuclease sequencing, we revealed that overexpression of HELLS increased nucleosome occupancy, which obstructed the accessibility of enhancers and hindered formation of the nucleosome-free region (NFR) at the transcription start site. Though this mechanism, up-regulation of HELLS mediated epigenetic silencing of multiple tumor suppressor genes including E-cadherin, FBP1, IGFBP3, XAF1 and CREB3L3 in HCC. Conclusion: Our data reveal that HELLS is a key epigenetic driver of HCC; by altering the nucleosome occupancy at the NFR and enhancer, HELLS epigenetically suppresses multiple tumor suppressor genes to promote HCC progression."

The strategies are 1) identifying fine-mapped SNPs that break/form response elements within chromatin bio-features in relevant cell types 2) considering the nearest gene on linear DNA, 3) analyzing eQTLs, 4) mapping differential DNA methylation regions and relating them to gene expression, 5) employing genomic editing with CRISPR/cas9 and 6) identifying topological associated chromatin domains using chromatin conformation capture."

These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programmes within them. "

The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the association between infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) and macrolides. Nine databases were searched systematically for studies with information on the association between macrolides and IHPS. We combined findings using random effects models. Our study revealed 18 articles investigating the association between macrolides and IHPS. There was a significant association between the development of IHPS and erythromycin (2.38, 1.06-5.39). The association was strong when erythromycin was used during the first 2\u00a0weeks of life (8.14, 4.29-15.45). During breastfeeding, use of macrolides showed no significant association with IHPS in infants (0.96, 0.61-1.53). IHPS was not associated with erythromycin (1.11, 0.9-1.36) or macrolides use during pregnancy (1.15, 0.98-1.36).Conclusions: There is an association between erythromycin use during infancy and developing IHPS in infants. However, no significant association was found between macrolides use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Additional large studies are needed to further evaluate potential association with macrolide use. What is known? \u2022 Erythromycin intake in the first 2\u00a0weeks of life is associated with an increased risk of pyloric stenosis. What is New? \u2022 There is currently no evidence of significant association between macrolides use during pregnancy or breastfeeding and pyloric stenosis."

Previous studies have shown that circRNA itself can be translated into proteins, whose function is closely related to the occurrence and development of human diseases. And it is expected to become an ideal substitute for mRNA, which can be widely used in protein engineering in the future. In this review, we systematically summarize the sources, biogenesis and features of circRNA, the driving models of circRNA translation, identification and functional verification of circRNA translation. We also sum up the latest research progress of circRNA translation in human diseases and its application in protein engineering, and make prospective anticipations for future research directions, which may offer more theoretical references for related researches in this field."

Tauopathies are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and other diseases. Hyperphosphorylation increases tau tendency to aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), a pathological hallmark of AD. In this study, okadaic acid (OA, 100 nM), a protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor, was treated for 24h in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) and differentiated rat primary neuronal cortical cell cultures (CTX) to induce tau-hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization as a cell-based tauopathy model. Following the treatments, the effectiveness of different kinase inhibitors was assessed using the tauopathy-relevant tau antibodies through tau-immunoblotting, including the sites: pSer202/pThr205 (AT8), pThr181 (AT270), pSer202 (CP13), pSer396/pSer404 (PHF-1), and pThr231 (RZ3). OA-treated samples induced tau phosphorylation and oligomerization at all tested epitopes, forming a monomeric band (46-67 kDa) and oligomeric bands (170 kDa and 240 kDa). We found that TBB (a casein kinase II inhibitor), AR and LiCl (GSK-3 inhibitors), cyclosporin A (calcineurin inhibitor), and Saracatinib (Fyn kinase inhibitor) caused robust inhibition of OA-induced monomeric and oligomeric p-tau in both N2a and CTX culture. Additionally, a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 inhibitor (Roscovitine) and a calcium chelator (EGTA) showed contrasting results between the two neuronal cultures. This study provides a comprehensive view of potential drug candidates (TBB, CsA, AR, and Saracatinib), and their efficacy against tau hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization processes. These findings warrant further experimentation, possibly including animal models of tauopathies, which may provide a putative Neurotherapy for AD, CTE, and other forms of tauopathy-induced neurodegenerative diseases."

Accumulating evidence suggests that these cells coordinate the inflammatory response that accompanies various clinical brain conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, investigating the functions of these cells and how these are regulated have become important areas of research in neuroscience over the past decade. In this regards, recent efforts to characterize the epigenomic mechanisms underlying microglial gene transcription have provided significant insights into the mechanisms that control the ontogeny and the cellular competences of microglia. In particular, these studies have established that a substantial proportion of the microglial repertoire of promoter-distal genomic regulatory elements, or enhancers, is relatively specific to these cells compared to other tissue-resident macrophages. Notably, this specificity is under the regulation of factors present in the brain that modulate activity of target axes of signaling pathways-transcription factors in microglia. Thus, the microglial enhancer repertoire is highly responsive to perturbations in the cerebral tissue microenvironment and this responsiveness has profound implications on the activity of these cells in brain diseases.

Inhibition and enzyme digestion studies confirm that the labeled sites are from RNA transcripts and that RNA polymerase I (RP I) and II (RP II) are responsible for nucleolar and extranucleolar transcription, respectively. An average of 2,000 sites are detected per nucleus with over 90% in the extranucleolar compartment where they are arranged in clusters and three-dimensional networklike arrays. The number of transcription sites, their three-dimensional organization and arrangement into functional zones (Wei et al. 1998) is strikingly maintained after extraction for nuclear matrix. Significant levels of total RP II mediated transcription sites (45%) were associated with splicing factor-rich nuclear speckles even though the speckles occupied <10% of the total extranucleolar space. Moreover, the vast majority of nuclear speckles (>90%) had moderate to high levels of associated transcription activity. Transcription sites were found along the periphery as well as inside the speckles themselves. These spatial relations were confirmed in optical sections through individual speckles and after in vivo labeling of nascent transcripts. Our results demonstrate that nuclear speckles and their surrounding regions are major sites of RP II-mediated transcription in the cell nucleus, and support the view that both speckle- and nonspeckle-associated regions of the nucleus contain sites for the coordination of transcription and splicing processes."

So far, there is plenty of evidence indicating that plasticity has been in some of the cortical or subcortical regions closely related to the LD, particularly stimulated by external learning tasks. Therefore, the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that similar effect exists in the LD. The transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), works essentially in brain plasticity by tightly regulating the transcriptional level of memory-related target genes, and the increase of activated CREB (phosphorylated CREB, p-CREB) could facilitate memory consolidation. In this study, the siRNA against CREB was synthesized to down-regulate the CREB mRNA in the LD. After Morris water maze behavioral training, CREB siRNA rats exhibited a memory deficiency, significantly diverging from the control groups. In subsequent detection, the expression of p-CREB of these memory impairment rats attenuated. These results support the hypothesis that CREB-mediated plasticity contributes to memory facilitation and consolidation in the LD."

Some patients experience an intermediate phase called smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), characterized by higher levels of abnormal immunoglobulins and more plasma cells in the bone marrow. Most cases of SMM progress to MM over 15 years. MM has specific diagnostic criteria with defining clinical characteristics: hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions (ie, CRAB criteria). MM management involves corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation, as well as addressing complications including renal disease, hypercalcemia, bone disease, pain, hyperviscosity syndrome, infections, thromboembolic events, and anemia.

Key additional exclusion criteria for EBBINGHAUS were dementia, cognitive impairment, or other significant mental or neurological disorder. Cognitive testing was performed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a tablet-based tool assessing executive function, working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed at baseline, weeks 24 and 48, every 48 weeks thereafter, and study end. The primary endpoint was spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (SWMSI). The primary hypothesis was that evolocumab would be noninferior to placebo in the mean change from baseline over time in SWMSI. Fifteen hundred cognitively normal patients completing the assessments provided approximately 97% power to demonstrate that the upper 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference in mean change from baseline in SWMSI over time is <20% of the SD of the mean change in the placebo group. An exploratory analysis will compare neurocognitive function in patients with post-baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <25 mg/dL. EBBINGHAUS will evaluate whether the addition of evolocumab to statin therapy affects cognitive function over time in patients with stable cardiovascular disease."

Although it has shown promise as a biotherapeutic, its cardiotoxicity remains a major concern. Genotoxic anticancer anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and epirubicin are also known for their cardiotoxic effects. However, trastuzumab and anthracyclines are suggested to mediate cardiotoxicity via different pathways. The available lines of evidence suggest that trastuzumab can exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines and thus, prior exposure to anthracyclines is regarded as one of the risk factors for trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxcity. Although it is generally believed that the trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxic effects are reversible, various preclinical studies have revealed its apoptotic effects on cardiomyocytes. Thus, the issue of the reversibility of its cardiotoxic effects remains to be fully resolved. This article discusses various mechanisms that have been proposed for the cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab and the potential risk factors that can lead to cardiotoxicity. The recently approved anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies including pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab (T-DM1) are also discussed."

SGLT2 inhibitors lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.6-0.8% (6-8 mmol/mol) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and induce weight loss and improve various metabolic parameters including blood pressure, lipid profile and hyperuricemia. Recent cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials have shown the improvement of CV and renal outcomes by treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin. The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve CV outcome appear not to be glucose-lowering or anti-atherosclerotic effects, but rather hemodynamic effects through osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. Generally, SGLT2 inhibitors are well-tolerated, but their adverse effects include genitourinary tract infection and dehydration. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis is a rare but severe adverse event for which patients under SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should be carefully monitored. The possibility of an increase in risk of lower-extremity amputation and bone fracture has also been reported with canagliflozin. Clinical trials and real-world data have suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors improve CV and renal outcomes and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), especially in those with prior CV events, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Results of recent trials including individuals without diabetes may change the positioning of this drug as \u2033a drug for cardiorenal protection\u2033.

We provide evidence that DLX2 directly drives Gad1, Gad2, and Vgat expression, and show that mutants had reduced mIPSC amplitude. In addition, the mutants formed fewer GABAergic synapses on excitatory neurons and had reduced mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, Dlx1/2 CKO had hypoplastic dendrites, fewer excitatory synapses, and reduced excitatory input. We provide evidence that some of these phenotypes were due to reduced expression of GRIN2B (a subunit of the NMDA receptor), a high confidence Autism gene.

Results uncovered unexpected mechanistic differences between zebrafish and mammals. Conserved synteny and expression analyses revealed that cyp26a1 in zebrafish and its paralog Cyp26b1 in tetrapods independently became the primary genes encoding enzymes available for gonadal RA-degradation, showing lineage-specific subfunctionalization of vertebrate genome duplication (VGD) paralogs. Experiments showed that zebrafish express aldh1a2, which encodes an RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the gonad rather than in the mesonephros as in mouse. Germ cells in bipotential gonads of all zebrafish analyzed were labeled by the early meiotic marker sycp3, suggesting that in zebrafish, the onset of meiosis is not sexually dimorphic as it is in mouse and is independent of Stra8, which is required in mouse but was lost in teleosts. Analysis of dead-end knockdown zebrafish depleted of germ cells revealed the germ cell-independent onset and maintenance of gonadal aldh1a2 and cyp26a1 expression. After meiosis initiated, somatic cell expression of cyp26a1 became sexually dimorphic: up-regulated in testes but not ovaries. Meiotic germ cells expressing the synaptonemal complex gene sycp3 occupied islands of somatic cells that lacked cyp26a1 expression, as predicted by the hypothesis that Cyp26a1 acts as a meiosis-inhibiting factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, females up-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes that entered prophase-I meiotic arrest, and down-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes resuming meiosis. Co-expression of cyp26a1 and the pluripotent germ cell stem cell marker pou5f1(oct4) in meiotically arrested oocytes was consistent with roles in mouse to promote germ cell survival and to prevent apoptosis, mechanisms that are central for tipping the sexual fate of gonads towards the female pathway in zebrafish.

By subjecting adjacent thin and semi-thin sections of an activated granule to ultrastructural examination for membrane enlargement, and to metachromatic staining for verification of pore formation it is concluded that the perigranular membrane can indeed enlarge prior to pore formation. However, the degree of membrane enlargement can far exceed the limit of 2-3% stretching allowed under normal osmotic stress for a membrane bilayer.

But it can have limitations for evaluating simultaneous causal relationships in complex data sets that include, for example, multiple genetic predictors and multiple potential risk factors associated with the same genetic variant. Here we use real and simulated data to investigate Bayesian network analysis (BN) with the incorporation of directed arcs, representing genetic anchors, as an alternative approach. A Bayesian network describes the conditional dependencies/independencies of variables using a graphical model (a directed acyclic graph) with an accompanying joint probability. In real data, we found BN could be used to infer simultaneous causal relationships that confirmed the individual causal relationships suggested by bi-directional MR, while allowing for the existence of potential horizontal pleiotropy (that would violate MR assumptions). In simulated data, BN with two directional anchors (mimicking genetic instruments) had greater power for a fixed type 1 error than bi-directional MR, while BN with a single directional anchor performed better than or as well as bi-directional MR. Both BN and MR could be adversely affected by violations of their underlying assumptions (such as genetic confounding due to unmeasured horizontal pleiotropy). BN with no directional anchor generated inference that was no better than by chance, emphasizing the importance of directional anchors in BN (as in MR). Under highly pleiotropic simulated scenarios, BN outperformed both MR (and its recent extensions) and two recently-proposed alternative approaches: a multi-SNP mediation intersection-union test (SMUT) and a latent causal variable (LCV) test. We conclude that BN incorporating genetic anchors is a useful complementary method to conventional MR for exploring causal relationships in complex data sets such as those generated from modern \"omics\" technologies."

Databases and trial registers were searched from inception to July 27, 2017, for randomized trials of (sub)acute or chronic back pain or sciatica participants that were administered combination drug therapy compared with monotherapy or placebo. Of the 27 studies included, most combinations (21 of 23) consisted of single trials. Most combinations had no or small effect on pain and disability. A clinically important difference was found in one combination, buprenorphine plus pregabalin versus buprenorphine for chronic back pain at immediate (mean difference = -23.30; 95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f-27.68 to -18.92) and short (mean difference\u202f=\u202f-27.60; 95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f-31.70 to -23.50) terms; however, the quality of evidence was low. There was no statistically significant increased risk of serious adverse events. When the risk of adverse events was statistically significant, it favored monotherapy or placebo. There is no clear evidence to support any combination drug therapy for the management of low back pain and sciatica due to the limited number of studies and overall low quality of evidence. Perspective: Combining medicines may give greater pain relief and/or improved tolerability compared with single-ingredient medicines. However, the lack of studies and overall low quality of evidence limit the recommendation of combination drug therapy for the management of low back pain and sciatica."

In particular, while the green fluorescent protein has provided revolutionary capabilities to fluorescence microscopy by connecting it to cellular functions such as gene expression, no equivalent reporter gene is currently available for OCT. Here we introduce gas vesicles, a class of naturally evolved gas-filled protein nanostructures, as genetically encodable OCT contrast agents. The differential refractive index of their gas compartments relative to surrounding aqueous tissue and their nanoscale motion enables gas vesicles to be detected by static and dynamic OCT. Furthermore, the OCT contrast of gas vesicles can be selectively erased in situ with ultrasound, allowing unambiguous assignment of their location. In addition, gas vesicle clustering modulates their temporal signal, enabling the design of dynamic biosensors. We demonstrate the use of gas vesicles as reporter genes in bacterial colonies and as purified contrast agents In Vivo in the mouse retina. Our results expand the utility of OCT to image a wider variety of cellular and molecular processes."

These virulence factors are encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island required for the characteristic attaching and effacing (AE) pathology seen in infection with these three pathogens. C. rodentium, which apparently infects only mice, provides a useful animal model for studying the molecular basis of AE pathology. No work has been done to assess differences in pathogenicity between C. rodentium isolates from diverse sources. Here, we report the examination of 15 C. rodentium isolates using a battery of genetic and biochemical approaches. No differences were observed between the isolates by repetitive-element sequence-based PCR analysis, biochemical analysis, and possession of LEE-specific virulence factors. These data suggest that members of the species are clonal. We further characterized an atypical E. coli strain from Japan called mouse-pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) that, in our hands, caused the same disease as C. rodentium. Applying the same battery of tests, we found that MPEC possesses LEE-encoded virulence factors and is indistinguishable from the previously characterized C. rodentium isolate DBS100. These results demonstrate that MPEC is a misclassified C. rodentium isolate and that members of this species are clonal and represent the only known attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen of mice."

The activity of osteoclasts relies on the typical organization of osteoclast cytoskeleton components into a highly complex structure comprising actin, microtubules and other cytoskeletal proteins that constitutes the backbone of the bone resorption apparatus. The development of methods to differentiate osteoclasts in culture and manipulate them genetically, as well as improvements in cell imaging technologies, has shed light onto the molecular mechanisms that control the structure and dynamics of the osteoclast cytoskeleton, and thus the mechanism of bone resorption. Although essential for normal bone physiology, abnormal osteoclast activity can cause bone defects, in particular their hyper-activation is commonly associated with many pathologies, hormonal imbalance and medical treatments. Increased bone degradation by osteoclasts provokes progressive bone loss, leading to osteoporosis, with the resulting bone frailty leading to fractures, loss of autonomy and premature death. In this context, the osteoclast cytoskeleton has recently proven to be a relevant therapeutic target for controlling pathological bone resorption levels. Here, we review the present knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms of the osteoclast cytoskeleton that control their bone resorption activity in normal and pathological conditions."

To identify molecular correlates of this sex bias, we investigated molecular pathology in females and males using the 5XFamilial Alzheimer's disease mutations (5XFAD) genetic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We profiled the transcriptome and proteome of the mouse hippocampus during early stages of disease development (1, 2, and 4\u2009months of age). Our analysis reveals 42 genes that are differentially expressed between disease and wild-type animals at 2\u2009months of age, prior to observable plaque deposition. In 4-month-old animals, we detect 1,316 differentially expressed transcripts between transgenic and control 5XFAD mice, many of which are associated with immune function. Additionally, we find that some of these transcriptional perturbations are correlated with altered protein levels in 4-month-old transgenic animals. Importantly, our data indicate that female 5XFAD mouse exhibit more profound pathology than their male counterparts as measured by differences in gene expression. We also find that the 5XFAD transgenes are more highly expressed in female 5XFAD mice than their male counterparts, which could partially account for the sex-biased molecular pathology observed in this dataset."

As more oncologists begin to use rucaparib and other PARP inhibitors as part of routine clinical practice, awareness of possible side effects and how to adequately manage toxicities is crucial. In this review, we summarize the safety and tolerability of rucaparib reported in an integrated safety analysis that supported the FDA's initial approval of rucaparib in the treatment setting. Additionally, drawing on clinical data and our personal experience with rucaparib, we provide our recommendations on the management of common side effects observed with rucaparib, including anemia, blood creatinine elevations, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevations, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal-related events (e.g., nausea, vomiting), and asthenia and fatigue. These side effects, many of which appear to be class effects of PARP inhibitors, are often self-limiting and can be managed with adequate interventions such as treatment interruption and/or dose reduction and the use of supportive therapies. Supportive therapies may include blood transfusions for patients with anemia, prophylactic medications to prevent nausea and vomiting, or behavioral interventions to mitigate fatigue. Understanding and appropriate management of potential side effects associated with rucaparib may allow patients with ovarian cancer to continue to benefit from rucaparib treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Rucaparib was recently approved in the U.S. and European Union for use as treatment or maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer. This review focuses on the safety and tolerability of rucaparib in the treatment setting. Similar side effects are observed in the maintenance setting. Drawing on the authors' clinical experience with rucaparib, rucaparib prescribing information, and published supportive cancer care guidelines, this review discusses how to optimally manage common rucaparib-associated side effects in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the real-world oncology setting. Adequate management of such side effects is crucial for allowing patients with ovarian cancer to remain on treatment to receive optimal efficacy benefit."

It is evident that proteins involved in DNA repair are compartmentalized in not only spontaneously occurring DNA lesions or ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), but a specific clustering of these proteins can also be observed within the whole cell nucleus. For example, 53BP1-positive and BRCA1-positive DNA repair foci decorate chromocenters and can appear close to nuclear speckles. Both 53BP1 and BRCA1 are well-described factors that play an essential role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. These proteins are members of two protein complexes: 53BP1-RIF1-PTIP and BRCA1-CtIP, which make a \"decision\" determining whether canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) is activated. It is generally accepted that 53BP1 mediates the NHEJ mechanism, while HDR is activated via a BRCA1-dependent signaling pathway. Interestingly, the 53BP1 protein appears relatively quickly at DSB sites, while BRCA1 is functional at later stages of DNA repair, as soon as the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is recruited to the DNA lesions. A function of the 53BP1 protein is also linked to a specific histone signature, including phosphorylation of histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) or methylation of histone H4 at the lysine 20 position (H4K20me); therefore, we also discuss an epigenetic landscape of 53BP1-positive DNA lesions."

Injured axons encounter irreversible damage if transected, or alternatively may maintain continuity and subsequently either recover or degenerate. Secondary mechanisms can cause further axon damage, myelin pathology, and neuroinflammation. Molecular mechanisms regulating the progression of white matter pathology indicate potential therapeutic targets. SARM1 is essential for execution of the conserved axon death pathway. We examined white matter pathology following mild TBI with CC traumatic axonal injury in mice with Sarm1 gene deletion (Sarm1-/-). High resolution ultrastructural analysis at 3\u202fdays post-TBI revealed dramatically reduced axon damage in Sarm1-/- mice, as compared to Sarm1+/+ wild-type controls. Sarm1 deletion produced larger axons with thinner myelin, and attenuated TBI induced demyelination, i.e. myelin loss along apparently intact axons. At 6\u202fweeks post-TBI, Sarm1-/- mice had less demyelination and thinner myelin than Sarm1+/+ mice, but axonal protection was no longer observed. We next used Thy1-YFP crosses to assess Sarm1 involvement in white matter neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation at 8\u202fweeks post-TBI, when significant CC atrophy indicates chronic pathology. Thy1-YFP expression demonstrated continued CC axon damage yet absence of overt cortical pathology. Importantly, significant CC atrophy in Thy1-YFP/Sarm1+/+ mice was associated with reduced neurofilament immunolabeling of axons. Both effects were attenuated in Thy1-YFP/Sarm1-/- mice. Surprisingly, Thy1-YFP/Sarm1-/- mice had increased CC astrogliosis. This study demonstrates that Sarm1 inactivation reduces demyelination, and white matter atrophy after TBI, while the post-injury stage impacts when axon protection is effective."

However, the low cargo limit of this vector allows its use in only a fraction of patients with mutations in relatively small pathogenic genes. To overcome this issue, we developed a single AAV platform that allows local replacement of a mutated sequence with its wildtype counterpart, based on combined CRISPR-Cas9 and micro-homology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). In blind mice, the mutation replacement rescued approximately 10% of photoreceptors, resulting in an improvement in light sensitivity and an increase in visual acuity. These effects were comparable to restoration mediated by gene supplementation, which targets a greater number of photoreceptors. This strategy may be applied for the treatment of inherited disorders caused by mutations in larger genes, for which conventional gene supplementation therapy is not currently feasible."

This dense bone around the otic capsule has therefore been called the choice substrate in palaeogenomics. Because the practice of forensic genetics responds to different imperatives, we implemented a study aimed at (i) understanding how and why the petrous bone is an advantageous substrate in ancient DNA studies and (ii) establishing whether it is advantageous in forensic STR typing. We selected 50 individual skeletal remains and extracted DNA from one tooth and one petrous bone from each. We then amplified 24 STR markers commonly used in forensic identification and compared the quality of that amplification using the RFU intensities of the signal as read on the STR profiles. We also performed histological analyses to compare (i) the microscopic structure of a petrous bone and of a tooth and (ii) the microscopic structure of fresh petrous bone and of an archaeological or forensic sample. We show that the RFU intensities read on STR profiles are systematically higher in experiments using DNA extracted from petrous bones rather than teeth. For this reason, we were more likely to obtain a complete STR profile from petrous bone material, increasing the chance of identification in a forensic setting. Histological analyses revealed peculiar microstructural characteristics (tissue organization), unique to the petrous bone, that might explain the good preservation of DNA in that substrate. Therefore, it appears that despite the necessity of analysing longer fragments in forensic STR typing compared to NGS palaeogenomics, the use of petrous bones in forensic genetics could prove valuable, especially in cases involving infants, toothless individuals or very degraded skeletal remains."

We used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt several intronic RPs in Drosophila melanogaster, some of which recapitulated characteristic loss-of-function phenotypes. Unexpectedly, selective disruption of RP splice donors revealed constitutive retention of unannotated short exons. Assays using functional minigenes confirm that unannotated cryptic splice donor sites are critical for recognition of intronic RPs, demonstrating that recursive splicing involves the recognition of cryptic RP exons. This appears to be a general mechanism, because canonical, conserved splice donors are specifically enriched in a 40-80-nt window downstream of known and newly annotated intronic RPs and exhibit similar properties to a broadly expanded class of expressed RP exons. Overall, these studies unify the mechanism of Drosophila recursive splicing with that in mammals."

Myocardial fibrosis has been analyzed in a mouse model of mitral valve myxomatous degeneration generated by pharmacological treatment with Nordexfenfluramine (NDF) in the presence of the MRA spironolactone. In vitro, adult human cardiac fibroblasts were treated with NDF and spironolactone. In an experimental mouse, MRA treatment reduced interstitial/perivascular fibrosis and collagen type I deposition. MRA administration blunted NDF-induced cardiac expression of vimentin and the profibrotic molecules galectin-3/cardiotrophin-1. In parallel, MRA blocked the increase in cardiac non-fibrillar proteins such as fibronectin, aggrecan, decorin, lumican and syndecan-4. The following effects are blocked by MRA: in vitro, in adult human cardiac fibroblasts, NDF-treatment-induced myofibroblast activation, collagen type I and proteoglycans secretion. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, the contribution of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to the development of myocardial fibrosis associated with mitral valve myxomatous degeneration.

An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in Lasius ants against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is based on active upregulation of the immune system of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members--that is, active versus passive immunisation. We found no evidence for involvement of passive immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (defensin and prophenoloxidase, PPO). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene cathepsin L, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that active social immunisation is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than passive immunisation. Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses (\"variolation\" or \"inoculation\")."

Although the role of p53 as a strong trans-activator of gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied. We designed and executed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to investigate the effect of transcription factor binding motifs and local sequence context on p53-bound CRE activity. Our data indicate that p53-bound CREs are both positively and negatively affected by alterations in local sequence context and changes to co-regulatory TF motifs. Our data suggest p53 has the flexibility to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors in order to regulate CRE activity. By utilizing different sets of co-factors across CREs, we hypothesize that global p53 activity is guarded against loss of any one regulatory partner, allowing for dynamic and redundant control of p53-mediated transcription."

We showed that, over time, uCr was less variable than urinary cystatin C and uVol. When the renal biomarkers were normalized with the 3 normalizing end points, the biomarkers showed (1) least variability following normalization with Cr in healthy animals and (2) poor sensitivity when normalized with urinary cystatin C in animals with renal injury. Overall, the results suggested that uCr is better than urinary cystatin C and uVol for normalizing renal biomarkers in rats under controlled preclinical conditions.

The factors associated with the early alleviation of the fever were analyzed, and the duration of the fever was compared between the baloxavir group and the NAI group. Results A total of 295 patients with influenza A, ranging in age from 0-91 years old, were enrolled in this study. A multivariate analysis showed that treatment with baloxavir and a duration from the onset to the start of treatment \u22652.5 days were factors contributing to the early alleviation of the fever from the start of treatment. The duration of the fever was significantly shorter in the baloxavir group than in the NAI group (p=0.002). Conclusion The present survey showed that baloxavir was significantly more effective than NAIs for treating patients with influenza A in clinical practice."

However, the origin of bacteria in milk and the process of milk microbe-mediated seeding of infant intestine need further elucidation. Presumed sources of bacteria in milk include locations of mother-infant and mother-environment interactions. We investigate the role of mother-infant interaction on breast milk microbes. Shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified milk microbes of mother-infant pairs in breastfed infants and in infants that have never latched. Although breast milk has low overall biomass, milk microbes play an important role in seeding the infant gut. Breast milk bacteria were largely comprised of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter primarily derived from maternal areolar skin and infant oral sites in breastfeeding pairs. This suggests that the process of breastfeeding is a potentially important mechanism for propagation of breast milk microbes through retrograde flux via infant oral and areolar skin contact. In one infant delivered via Caesarian section, a distinct strain of Bifidobacteria breve was identified in maternal rectum, breast milk and the infant's stool potentially suggesting direct transmission. This may support the existence of microbial translocation of this anaerobic bacteria via the enteromammary pathway in humans, where maternal bacteria translocate across the maternal gut and are transferred to the mammary glands. Modulating sources of human milk microbiome seeding potentially imply opportunities to ultimately influence the development of the infant microbiome and health."

It is characterised by stereotypical rhythmic up-and-down or side-to-side head movements. The pathophysiology and anatomical basis for this unusual manifestation is still a subject of intense scrutiny. The syndrome has never been described in a patient with both hydranencephaly and Chiari type 3 malformation. We describe a 2-year-old female patient who presented with congenital hydrocephalus, an occipital encephalocele and rhythmic bobbling of the head. Imaging investigation revealed a Chiari type 3 malformation and hydranencephaly. The patient was taken to theatre for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, and at day 3 post operatively, the patient had a markedly decreased head circumference and a decrease in the frequency of the bobbling of the head. A further review at 2\u00a0weeks showed that the bobbling of the head had ceased. Although the pathophysiology of bobble-head doll syndrome is yet to be fully understood, there has been postulation of either a third ventricular enlargement or a cerebellar dysfunction to explain bobble-head doll syndrome. Our case illustrates that the pathophysiology is most likely multifactorial as illustrated by the fact that\u00a0by just addressing the high intracranial pressure with a shunt was sufficient to treat the condition."

Mapping of digenic interactions for a deletion mutant of each paralog, and of trigenic interactions for the double mutant, provides insight into their roles and a quantitative measure of their functional redundancy. Trigenic interaction analysis distinguishes two classes of paralogs: a more functionally divergent subset and another that retained more functional overlap.

Prior binding of the repressive Ets transcription factor Etv6 predicts cohesin binding at these elements and Etv6 interacts with cohesin at chromatin. Depletion of cohesin severely impairs erythroid differentiation, particularly at Etv6-prebound loci, but augments self-renewal programs. Together with corroborative findings in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patient samples, these data suggest cohesin-mediated alleviation of Etv6 repression is required for dynamic expression at critical erythroid genes during differentiation and how this may be perturbed in myeloid malignancies."

Focusing on some of the longest ultraconserved sites genome wide, located near the essential neuronal transcription factor Arx, we used genome editing to create an expanded series of knockout mice lacking individual or combinations of ultraconserved enhancers. Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved enhancers were viable and fertile but in nearly all cases showed neurological or growth abnormalities, including substantial alterations of neuron populations and structural brain\u00a0defects.

Gingipains, a class of P. gingivalis proteases, are found in association with neurons, tau tangles, and beta-amyloid in specimens from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The brains of mice orally infected with P. gingivalis show evidence of P. gingivalis infiltration, along with various neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Oral administration of gingipain inhibitors to mice with established brain infections decreases the abundance of P. gingivalis DNA in brain and mitigates the neurotoxic effects of P. gingivalis infection.

Furthermore, considerable controversy exists in the literature regarding the nature of the interaction of free PAI-1 with LRP1. In this study, we examined the binding of free PAI-1 and complexes of PAI-1 with low-molecular-weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator to LRP1. Our results confirmed that uPA:PAI-1 complexes bind LRP1 with \u223c100-fold increased affinity over PAI-1 alone. Chemical modification of PAI-1 confirmed an essential requirement of lysine residues in PAI-1 for the interactions of both PAI-1 and uPA:PAI-1 complexes with LRP1. Results of surface plasmon resonance measurements supported a bivalent binding model in which multiple sites on PAI-1 and uPA:PAI-1 complexes interact with complementary sites on LRP1. An ionic-strength dependence of binding suggested the critical involvement of two charged residues for the interaction of PAI-1 with LRP1 and three charged residues for the interaction of uPA:PAI-1 complexes with LRP1. An enhanced affinity resulting from the interaction of three regions of the uPA:PAI-1 complex with LDLa repeats on LRP1 provided an explanation for the increased affinity of uPA:PAI-1 complexes for LRP1. Mutational analysis revealed an overlap between LRP1 binding and binding of a small-molecule inhibitor of PAI-1, CDE-096, confirming an important role for Lys-207 in the interaction of PAI-1 with LRP1 and of the orientations of Lys-207, -88, and -80 for the interaction of uPA:PAI-1 complexes with LRP1."

Given that 38.5% of U.S. adults 60years and older are obese and these numbers are rapidly increasing, strategies to decouple obesity from cognitive decline are needed. Innovative lifestyle strategies that may postpone the onset of subclinical symptoms or even arrest the transition to overt dementia in at-risk individuals are critically needed. Poor diet is central to the development of obesity and diet may affect cognition. Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

Although ETD spectra yielded higher identification scores, EThcD generally proved superior to ETD in identification and localization of ADP-ribosylation sites regardless of protease employed. Notwithstanding, the propensities of complementary proteases and fragmentation methods expanded the detectable repertoire of ADP-ribosylation to an unprecedented depth. This system-wide profiling of the ADP-ribosylome in HeLa cells subjected to DNA damage uncovered >11,000 unique ADP-ribosylated peptides mapping to >7,000 ADP-ribosylation sites, in total modifying over one-third of the human nuclear proteome and highlighting the vast scope of this PTM. High-resolution MS/MS spectra enabled identification of dozens of proteins concomitantly modified by ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation, revealing a considerable degree of crosstalk on histones. ADP-ribosylation was confidently localized to various amino acid residue types, including less abundantly modified residues, with hundreds of ADP-ribosylation sites pinpointed on histidine, arginine, and tyrosine residues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested modification of these specific residue types is directed in a spatial manner, with tyrosine ADP-ribosylation linked to the ribosome, arginine ADP-ribosylation linked to the endoplasmic reticulum, and histidine ADP-ribosylation linked to the mitochondrion."

This medication was found to be effective in reduction of symptom burden and spleen size; however, the median duration of response is about 3 years. In addition, many patients are intolerant or develop toxicities to ruxolitinib, including patients with anemia, as well as thrombocytopenia. Therefore, there is a critical need for alternate therapeutic options for patients with MF. Additional JAK-i have been developed over the last 8 years, including fedratinib, momelotinib, and pacritinib. Fedratinib recently received approval for treatment of MF both in the first-line and second-line setting. It has shown efficacy in the first-line setting, as well as in 30% of patients who are refractory/intolerant of ruxolitinib. This review covers the trials that have led to the approval of ruxolitinib as well as fedratinib, as well as reviews of two JAK inhibitors that are still under clinical investigation: momelotinib and pacritinib."

Molecular heterogeneity is a hallmark of GBM tumors that is a barrier in developing treatment strategies. In this study, we used the nonsynonymous mutations of GBM tumors deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and applied a systems level approach based on biophysical characteristics of mutations and their organization in patient-specific subnetworks to reduce inter-patient heterogeneity and to gain potential clinically relevant insights. Approximately 10% of the mutations are located in \"patches\" which are defined as the set of residues spatially in close proximity that are mutated across multiple patients. Grouping mutations as 3D patches reduces the heterogeneity across patients. There are multiple patches that are relatively small in oncogenes, whereas there are a small number of very large patches in tumor suppressors. Additionally, different patches in the same protein are often located at different domains that can mediate different functions. We stratified the patients into five groups based on their potentially affected pathways that are revealed from the patient-specific subnetworks. These subnetworks were constructed by integrating mutation profiles of the patients with the interactome data. Network-guided clustering showed significant association between the groups and patient survival (P-value = 0.0408). Also, each group carries a set of signature 3D mutation patches that affect predominant pathways. We integrated drug sensitivity data of GBM cell lines with the mutation patches and the patient groups to analyze the possible therapeutic outcome of these patches. We found that Pazopanib might be effective in Group 3 by targeting CSF1R. Additionally, inhibiting ATM that is a mediator of PTEN phosphorylation may be ineffective in Group 2. We believe that from mutations to networks and eventually to clinical and therapeutic data, this study provides a novel perspective in the network-guided precision medicine."

Here we show that de novo mutations in highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that only 0.15% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism. Our findings represent a robust estimate of the contribution of de novo mutations in regulatory elements to this genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, and emphasize the importance of combining functional and evolutionary evidence to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders."

Here, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, analytic ultracentrifugation, structural analysis, and computational modeling, along with deubiquitinase (DUB), and bacterial infection assays, we found that the bacterial Dot/Icm effector Ceg23 is a member of the ovarian-tumor (OTU) DUB family. We found that Ceg23 displays high specificity toward Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains and is localized on the LCV where it removes ubiquitin moieties from proteins ubiquitinated by the Lys-63-chain type. Analysis of the crystal structure of a Ceg23 variant lacking two putative transmembrane domains at 2.80 \u00c5 resolution revealed that despite very limited homology to established members of the OTU family at the primary sequence level, Ceg23 harbors a catalytic motif resembling those associated with typical OTU-type DUBs. ceg23 deletion increased the association of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin with the bacterial phagosome, indicating that Ceg23 regulates Lys-63-linked ubiquitin signaling on the LCV. In summary, our findings indicate that Ceg23 contributes to the regulation of the association of Lys-63 type polyubiquitin with the Legionella phagosome. Future identification of host substrates targeted by Ceg23 could clarify the roles of these polyubiquitin chains in the intracellular life cycle of L. pneumophila and Ceg23's role in bacterial virulence."

A patient with recurrent glioblastoma (MGG70R) harboring focal, high-level EGFR amplification received the irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib. The tumour that subsequently recurred (MGG70RR) showed diploid EGFR, suggesting inhibitor-mediated elimination of EGFR-amplified tumour cells and propagation of EGFR non-amplified cell subpopulations. The MGG70R-GSC line established from MGG70R formed xenografts retaining EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression, while MGG70RR-GSC established from MGG70RR generated tumours that lacked EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression. MGG70R-GSC-derived intracranial xenografts were more proliferative than MGG70RR-GSC xenografts, which had upregulated mesenchymal markers, mirroring the pathological observation in the corresponding patient tumours. In vitro MGG70R-GSC was more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors than MGG70RR-GSC. Thus, these molecularly distinct GSC lines recapitulated the subpopulation alteration that occurred during glioblastoma evasion of targeted therapy, and offer a valuable model facilitating therapeutic development for recurrent glioblastoma."

However, in genome sequencing studies, the identification of disease genes among a candidate gene list is often difficult because of the large number of apparently damaging (but usually neutral) variants. A number of variant prioritization tools have been developed to help detect disease-causal sites. However, the results may be misleading as many variants scored as damaging by these tools are often tolerated, and there are inconsistencies in prediction results among the different variant-level prediction tools. Recently, studies have indicated that understanding gene properties might improve detection of genes liable to have associated disease variation and that this information improves molecular diagnostics. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate how understanding gene-specific properties might improve filtering strategies in clinical sequence data to prioritize potential disease variants. Improved understanding of the 'disease genome', which includes coding, noncoding and regulatory variation, might help resolve difficult cases. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of existing gene-level approaches, the relationships between measures of gene-pathogenicity and how use of these prediction tools can be developed for molecular diagnostics."

Until now, the reasons for the catalytic incapability of ADAR3 has not been defined and its biological function rarely explored. Yet, its exclusive expression in the brain and involvement in learning and memory suggest a central role in the nervous system. Here we describe the engineering of a catalytically active ADAR3 enzyme using a combination of computational design and functional screening. Five mutations (A389V, V485I, E527Q, Q549R and Q733D) engender RNA deaminase in human ADAR3. By way of its catalytic activity, the ADAR3 pentamutant was used to identify potential binding targets for wild type ADAR3 in a human glioblastoma cell line. Novel ADAR3 binding sites discovered in this manner include the 3'-UTRs of the mRNAs encoding early growth response 1 (EGR1) and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1); both known to be activity-dependent immediate early genes that respond to stimuli in the brain. Further studies reveal that the wild type ADAR3 protein can regulate transcript levels for DUSP1 and EGR1, suggesting a novel role ADAR3 may play in brain function."

Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission."

Extensive research has shown that dietary intake or supplementation of the natural flavonoid quercetin might be useful for treating anxiety-related symptoms. The objectives of this study were to determine whether quercetin treatment can attenuate anxiogenic-like behaviors and normalize HPA axis function in mice with mTBI. Animals subjected to mTBI were treated daily with quercetin (50\u2009mg/kg) or diazepam (positive control, 3\u2009mg/kg) for 14 days. Four behavioral tests (open field, plus maze, light-dark box, and zero maze) were used to assess anxiety-related behaviors in mice. To evaluate HPA axis function, adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone were measured in the serum of mice after the anxiety tests. Quercetin treatment was found to significantly reduce anxiety-like behaviors in mTBI-induced mice. A strength of this study is the consistency of results among anxiety tests. The dysregulation of the HPA axis in mTBI-induced mice treated with quercetin was also attenuated, with decreased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. The effects of quercetin were comparable with those of diazepam treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that quercetin might be useful for treating anxiety-related symptoms and HPA axis hyperreactivity in patients with mTBI."

Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life."

Therefore, additional drugs to enhance the antitumor effects of mogamulizumab are needed to further optimize its use for the treatment of MF. In this report, two cases of mogamulizumab-resistant MF successfully treated with additional administration of etoposide are presented. Moreover, the possible mechanisms of mogamulizumab-etoposide combined therapy for the treatment of MF were investigated based on the modulation of chemokine profiles in vivo using an EL-4 mouse T-cell lymphoma model. Intraperitoneal administration of etoposide significantly increased the mRNA expressions of CCL17, CXCL5, and CXCL10, suggesting that CCR4+ CTCL cells gather around the tumor-associated macrophagess. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of etoposide on the mRNA expressions of these chemokines were validated using monocyte-derived M2 macrophages in vitro. Since mogamulizumab shows cytotoxicity against CCR4+ lymphoma cells by ADCC that depends on the contact between the lymphoma cells and the effector cells, these chemokines could enhance the therapeutic effect of mogamulizumab."

In this study, an aggressive, bioluminescent orthotopic bladder cancer model, MB49 tumor cells transfected with luciferase (MB49(luc)), was used to study the antitumor effects of avelumab, an antibody to PD-L1. MB49(luc) murine tumor cells form multifocal tumors on the mucosal wall of the bladder reminiscent of non-muscle invasive, nonmetastatic urothelial carcinomas. MB49(luc) bladder tumors are highly positive for the expression of PD-L1, and avelumab administration induced significant (P < 0.05) antitumor effects. These antitumor effects were more dependent on the presence of CD4 than CD8 T cells, as determined by in vivo immune cell depletions. The findings suggest that in this bladder tumor model, interruption of the immune-suppressive PD-1/PD-L1 complex releases a local adaptive immune response that, in turn, reduces tumor growth. This bladder tumor model can be used to further identify host antitumor immune mechanisms and evaluate combinations of immune-based therapies for carcinoma in situ and non-muscle invasive, nonmetastatic urothelial carcinoma, to provide the rationale for subsequent clinical studies.

However, the precise role of BCL11B in humans is largely unexplored, except for a single patient with a BCL11B missense mutation, affected by multisystem anomalies and profound immune deficiency. Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes."

In addition to the liver-related morbidity and mortality, NAFLD is now also associated with various extrahepatic diseases. Pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial with limited pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of patients with NAFLD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, energy balance, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. PPAR agonists are attractive options for treatment of NAFLD as they can act at multiple targets involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. We reviewed the available literature on the pathophysiological role of PPARs and use of PPAR agonists in the treatment of NAFLD. Original studies and review articles available on PubMed regarding the role of PPARs in the pathogenesis and utility of PPAR\u00a0agonists in the treatment of NAFLD were included in this review article. ClinicalTrials.gov and Clinical Trials Registry-India sites were searched for ongoing studies on saroglitazar. The available literature suggests that PPARs play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Use of PPAR gamma agonists is associated with histological improvement in NAFLD. Dual PPAR agonists with no or minimal PPAR gamma activity are being explored in the treatment of NAFLD. Because of the pathophysiological role of PPARs in NAFLD, PPAR agonists are attractive options for the treatment of patients with NAFLD. Dual PPAR agonists without significant gamma activity appear promising for the treatment of NAFLD."

Instead, we design and optimize a fusion peptide TPL comprising a BBB-penetrating peptide TGN and a neuron binding peptide Tet1 through a four-glycine linker. Compared to the mono-ligand Tet1 or CGN which is the retro-inverso isomer of TGN with higher brain targeting than TGN, the dual-ligand fusion peptide TPL has preferable blood stability and enhanced structural flexibility, resulting in higher binding affinity to either GT1b ganglioside receptor or brain capillary endothelial bEnd.3 cells.

Transplantation of the engineered fibroblasts into a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction led to improved cardiac function and mouse survival, and in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, exosomes secreted by the engineered fibroblasts improved exercise capacity and reduced skeletal-muscle fibrosis. We also demonstrate that exosomes from high-potency cardiosphere-derived cells exhibit enhanced levels of miR-92a (a known potentiator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway), and that they activate cardioprotective bone-morphogenetic-protein signalling in cardiomyocytes.

Although adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of both bullying and suicidality, there is very little research that examines the extent to which an experience of being bullied may increase suicidality within this specific population. To address this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the longitudinal association between experiencing bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of 680 adolescents with ASD. Electronic health records of adolescents (13-17\u2009years), using mental health services in South London, with a diagnosis of ASD were analyzed. Natural language processing was employed to identify mentions of bullying and suicidality in the free text fields of adolescents' clinical records. Cox regression analysis was employed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between bullying and suicidality outcomes. Reported experience of bullying in the first month of clinical contact was associated with an increased risk suicidality over the follow-up period (hazard ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.28-2.59). In addition, female gender, psychosis, affective disorder diagnoses, and higher intellectual ability were all associated with suicidality at follow-up. This study is the first to demonstrate the strength of longitudinal associations between bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of adolescents with ASD, using automated approaches to detect key life events within clinical records.

We examined the clinical records of adolescents (aged 13-18\u2009years old) with ASD in South London who were receiving treatment from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. We found that if they reported being bullied in the first month after they were first seen by mental health services, they were nearly twice as likely to go on to develop suicidal thoughts or behaviors."

The most common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases involve progressive impairment of neurodegeneration and memory impairment. A wide range of compounds have been identified as potential neuroprotective agents against different models of neurodegeneration both in vivo and in vitro. Hesperetin, a flavanone class of citrus flavonoid, is a derivative of hesperidin found in citrus fruits such as oranges, grapes, and lemons. It has been extensively reported that hesperetin exerts neuroprotective effects in experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases. In this systematic review, we have compiled all the studies conducted on hesperetin in both in vivo and in vitro models of neurodegeneration. Here, we have used an approach to lessen the bias in each study, providing a least biased, broad understanding of findings and impartial conclusions of the strength of evidence and the reliability of findings. In this review, we collected different papers from a wide range of journals describing the beneficial effects of hesperetin on animal models of neurodegeneration. Our results demonstrated consistent neuroprotective effects of hesperetin against different models of neurodegeneration. In addition, we have summarized its underlying mechanisms. This study provides the foundations for future studies and recommendations of further mechanistic approaches to conduct preclinical studies on hesperetin in different models."

ApoE in the brain is produced primarily by astrocytes; once secreted from these cells, apoE binds lipids and forms high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles. Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) in the brain is a key hallmark of AD, and is thought to initiate a pathogenic cascade leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. The level and lipidation state of apoE affect A\u03b2 aggregation and clearance pathways. Elevated levels of plasma HDL are associated with lower risk and severity of AD; the underlying mechanisms, however, have not been fully elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the impact of an HDL mimetic peptide, 4F, on the secretion and lipidation of apoE. We found that 4F significantly increases apoE secretion and lipidation in primary human astrocytes as well as in primary mouse astrocytes and microglia. Aggregated A\u03b2 inhibits glial apoE secretion and lipidation, causing accumulation of intracellular apoE, an effect that is counteracted by co-treatment with 4F. Pharmacological and gene editing approaches show that 4F mediates its effects partially through the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and requires the lipid transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. We conclude that the HDL mimetic peptide 4F promotes glial apoE secretion and lipidation and mitigates the detrimental effects of A\u03b2 on proper cellular trafficking and functionality of apoE. These findings suggest that treatment with such an HDL mimetic peptide may provide therapeutic benefit in AD. Read the Editorial Highlight for this article on page\u00a0580."

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are the dark matter of biology due to inability to visualize them using standard structure elucidation technique such as X-ray crystallography due to lack in diffraction signal. IDPs are the functionally important class of proteins with entire protein or its parts lack ordered three-dimensional structure. Computational studies have predicted that nearly one-third of the human proteome is disordered, which gives the enormous flexibility and functional diversity to proteins. The conserved residues and elements in disordered proteins are critical for function and might be parts of peptide motifs or protein-protein interaction interfaces. For example, regions of proteins that are involved in disorder-based molecular recognition are known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Generally, MoRFs could undergo disorder to order transition or vice versa at interaction with specific partners. Hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a master transcriptional regulator involved in response to hypoxia, which is associated with many pathological conditions. Importantly, HIF-1\u03b1 regulates various steps of cancer progression such as cell survival, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. In this chapter, we have extensively analyzed the molecular recognition features and their relationship with disordered regions and associated structural islands of HIF-1\u03b1. We had also analyzed the disorderness and MoRFs of HIF-1\u03b1 primary interaction partners that are enriched in IDPRs and MoRFs giving their role in protein-protein interaction and cancer regulation."

We tested the hypothesis that ASPN regulated proliferation of gastric cancer (GC) cells and identified its down-stream regulators. ASPN promoted the proliferation of GC cells. We identified the effector of this effect as proteasome 26S subunit non-ATPase 2 (PSMD2) which is known to regulate proliferation through suppression of DUSP7, WIP1 and PTEN and then inducing the phosphorylation of ERK, P38 and AKT. PSMD2 co-immunoprecipitated with ASPN from GC cell lysates and co-localized with PSMD2 inside GC cells. Moreover, knockdown of ASPN significantly increased the expression of DUSP7, WIP1 and PTEN and led to a repression in the phosphorylation of ERK, P38 and AKT. These changes were counteracted by knockdown of PSMD2. In conclusion, ASPN promotes cell proliferation by interacting with PSMD2, and down-regulation of its effectors and serves as a potential therapeutic target in GC."

This arrangement is thought to bring enhancers into closer physical proximity with their target genes, which often are located hundreds of kilobases away in linear genomic distance. TADs are demarcated by boundary regions bound by architectural proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin, although much remains to be discovered about the structure and function of these domains. Recent studies of TAD boundaries disrupted in engineered mouse models show that boundary mutations can recapitulate human developmental disorders as a result of aberrant promoter-enhancer interactions in the affected TADs. Similar boundary disruptions in certain cancers can result in oncogene overexpression, and CTCF binding sites at boundaries appear to be hyper-mutated across cancers. Further insights into chromatin organisation, in parallel with accumulating whole genome sequence data for disease cohorts, are likely to yield additional valuable insights into the roles of noncoding sequence variation in human disease."

One hypothesis for the mechanism of this feature is amyloid formation by the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP). Despite the global prevalence of T2DM, there are no therapeutic strategies for the treatment of or prevention of amylin amyloidosis. Clinical trials and population studies indicate the healthy virtues of the Mediterranean diet, especially the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) found in this diet. This oil is enriched in phenolic compounds shown to be effective against several aging and lifestyle diseases. Oleuropein (Ole), one of the most abundant polyphenols in EVOO, has been reported to be anti-diabetic. Some of Ole's main derivative have attracted our interest due to their multi-targetted effects, including interference with amyloid aggregation path. However, the structure-function relationship of Ole and its metabolites in T2DM are not yet clear. We report here a broad biophysical approach and cell biology techniques that enabled us to characterize the different molecular mechanisms by which tyrosol (TYR), hydroxytyrosol (HT), oleuropein (Ole) and oleuropein aglycone (OleA) modulate the hIAPP fibrillation in vitro and their effects on cell cytotoxicity. The OleA formed by enolic acid and hydroxytyrosol moiety was found to be more active than the Ole and HT at low micromolar concentrations. We further demonstrated that OleA inhibit the cytotoxicity induced by hIAPP aggregates by protecting more the cell membrane from permeabilization and then from death. These findings highlight the benefits of consuming EVOO and the great potential of its polyphenols, mainly OleA. Moreover, they support the possibility to validate and optimize the possible pharmacological use of EVOO polyphenols for T2DM prevention and therapy and also for many other amyloid related diseases."

The present study aimed to investigate the roles of PIO and KLF4 in the transcriptional regulation of apelin in a high-fat diet/streptozotocin rat model of diabetes and in PIO-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting assays revealed that the aorta of the Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat models had a high expression of apelin, PIO could decrease the expression of apelin in the PIO-treated rats. In vitro, Western blotting assays and immunofluorescent staining results showed that the basal expression of apelin was decreased but that of KLF4 was increased when VSMCs were stimulated by PIO treatment. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results suggested that KLF4 bound to the GKLF-binding site of the apelin promoter and negatively regulated the transcription activity of apelin in VSMCs under PIO stimulation. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assay results showed that the overexpression of KLF4 markedly decreased the basal expression of apelin, but the knockdown of KLF4 restored the PIO-induced expression of apelin. In conclusion, PIO inhibited the expression of apelin in T2DM rat models to prevent diabetic macroangiopathy, and negatively regulated the gene transcription of apelin by promoting transcription of KLF4 in the apelin promoter."

We found that the cytoplasmic activity, in charge of nucleus centering, shaped the nucleus while promoting nuclear envelope fluctuations and chromatin motion. Off-centered nuclei in F-actin mutant oocytes were misshaped with immobile chromatin and modulated gene expression. Restoration of F-actin in mutant oocytes rescued nucleus architecture fully and gene expression partially. Thus, the F-actin-mediated pressure gradient also modulates nucleus dynamics in oocytes.

However, the efficacy of tocilizumab for PsA was not favorable. This suggests that the pathogenic roles of IL-6 in PsA and RA are different. In RA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) primarily contributes to the arthritis effector phase and IL-6 contributes to the arthritis priming phase. In PsA, the TNF-related effector phase is similar to that in RA, but the IL-6-related priming phase might not be critical. This paper discusses the role of IL-6 in PsA."

Unfortunately, there are few effective treatments for AD, and many drug development trials for AD ultimately have failed. Current AD clinical trials include disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic cognitive enhancers, and symptomatic agents addressing neuropsychiatric and behavioral changes. Disease modifying therapies include anti-amyloid agents and anti-tau agents, both of which contain small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, or biological therapies. Amyloid is the most common specific target in phase 3 and phase 2 disease modification trials. Recent drug development trials for AD include preclinical and prodromal populations. Although biomarkers are increasingly used in drug development for AD, they are not used uniformly for confirmation of AD diagnosis. Enrollment of earlier populations, new biomarkers (e.g., neurofilament light), novel outcomes (e.g., AD Composite Score [ADCOMS]), and innovative trial designs (e.g., futility analysis, Bayesian adaptive designs) are needed to develop effective drugs against AD."

Although overly robust inflammatory responses may exacerbate secondary tissue injury, inflammatory processes are ultimately necessary for recovery. Traditional drug discovery often relies on reductionist approaches to isolate and modulate specific intracellular pathways believed to be involved in disease pathology. However, endogenous brain proteins are often pleiotropic in order to regulate neuroinflammation and recovery mechanisms. Thus, a process of \"backward translation\" aims to harness the adaptive properties of endogenous proteins to promote earlier and greater recovery after acute brain injury. One such endogenous protein is apolipoprotein E (apoE), the primary apolipoprotein produced in the brain. Robust preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates that endogenous apoE produced within the brain modulates the neuroinflammatory response of the acutely injured brain. Thus, one innovative approach to improve outcomes following acute brain injury is administration of exogenous apoE-mimetic drugs optimized to cross the blood-brain barrier. In particular, one promising apoE mimetic peptide, CN-105, has demonstrated efficacy across a wide variety of preclinical models of brain injury and safety and feasibility in early-phase clinical trials. Preclinical and clinical evidence for apoE's neuroprotective effects and downregulation of neuroinflammatory and the resulting translational therapeutic development strategy for an apoE-based therapeutic are reviewed."

The minimum effective concentrations and dose-dependent curves of verteporfin and sodium porfimer on PANC-1 were determined. Since pancreatic cancer is known to have significant stromal components, the effect of PDT on stromal cells was also assessed. To mimic tumor-stroma interaction, a co-culture of primary human fibroblasts or human pancreatic stellate cell (HPSCs) line with PANC-1 was used to test verteporfin-PDT-mediated cell death of PANC-1. Two cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) were used for stimulation of primary fibroblasts (derived from human esophageal biopsies) or HPSCs. The increased expression of smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) confirmed the activation of fibroblasts or HPSC upon treatment with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Cell death assays showed that both sodium porfimer- and verteporfin-mediated PDT-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner.

Treatment of HOS cells with inhibitors of different endocytic pathways suggest that uptake of EGFP-labelled mitochondria occurs via an actin-dependent endocytic pathway which is consistent with macropinocytosis. We later utilised time-lapse microscopy to show that internalised mitochondria were found in large, motile cellular vesicles. Finally, we used confocal imaging to show that EGFP-labelled mitochondria colocalise with a macropinocytic cargo molecule during internalisation, HOS cells produce membrane ruffles interacting with external mitochondria during uptake and EGFP-labelled mitochondria are found within early macropinosomes inside cells. In conclusion our results are consistent with isolated mitochondria being internalised by macropinocytosis in HOS cells."
