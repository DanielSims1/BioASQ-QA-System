However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for biased signaling are unresolved due to a lack of insight into the phosphorylation patterns of full-length EGFR. We extended a single-molecule pull-down technique previously used to study protein-protein interactions to allow for robust measurement of receptor phosphorylation. We found that EGFR is predominantly phosphorylated at multiple sites, yet phosphorylation at specific tyrosines is variable and only a subset of receptors share phosphorylation at the same site, even with saturating ligand concentrations. We found distinct populations of receptors as soon as 1 min after ligand stimulation, indicating early diversification of function. To understand this heterogeneity, we developed a mathematical model. The model predicted that variations in phosphorylation are dependent on the abundances of signaling partners, while phosphorylation levels are dependent on dimer lifetimes. The predictions were confirmed in studies of cell lines with different expression levels of signaling partners, and in experiments comparing low- and high-affinity ligands and oncogenic EGFR mutants. These results reveal how ligand-regulated receptor dimerization dynamics and adaptor protein concentrations play critical roles in EGFR signaling."

Rat Nlk gene encoded 515-aa Nlk protein with the serine/threonine kinase domain, poly(His) tracts and poly(Ala) tract, which showed 100, 99.8, 97.1 and 89.5% total-amino-acid identity with mouse Nlk, human NLK, Xenopus nlk and zebrafish nlk, respectively.

Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene were predicted as retrotransposed Nlk homologs within the rat genome. Nlk2 gene encoded a 480-aa Nlk2 protein with partial deletion within the kinase domain, which was predicted as the dominant negative Nlk homolog.

We provide evidence for the compatibility of the proposed model with recent findings showing senescence in postmitotic tissues, wound healing, obesity, and development.

Previous studies about transcriptional responses to reprogramming overlooked human reprogramming and are compromised by the fact that only a rare population proceeds towards pluripotency, and a significant amount of the collected transcriptional data may not represent the positive reprogramming. We recently developed a concept of reprogramome, which allows one to study the early transcriptional responses to the Yamanaka factors in the perspective of reprogramming legitimacy of a gene response to reprogramming. Using RNA-seq, this study scored 579 genes successfully reprogrammed within 48 h, indicating the potency of the reprogramming factors. This report also tallied 438 genes reprogrammed significantly but insufficiently up to 72 h, indicating a positive drive with some inadequacy of the Yamanaka factors. In addition, 953 member genes within the reprogramome were transcriptionally irresponsive to reprogramming, showing the inability of the reprogramming factors to directly act on these genes. Furthermore, there were 305 genes undergoing six types of aberrant reprogramming: over, wrong, and unwanted upreprogramming or downreprogramming, revealing significant negative impacts of the Yamanaka factors. The mixed findings about the initial transcriptional responses to the reprogramming factors shed new insights into the robustness as well as limitations of the Yamanaka factors."

While more evidence is provided for older AEDs on their effect on mood changes, newer AEDs such as lacosamide have not yet been extensively studied. We performed a systematic review of the literature available on the impact of lacosamide on mood in adult patients with epilepsy. A literature search on MEDLINE, COCHRANE, Scielo, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases was performed, and articles where mood scales where specifically reported as primary or secondary outcome measures were included. Articles differed greatly in terms of inclusion criteria, concomitant AEDs, seizure reduction control, and outcome measures. If lacosamide is used as add-on, two studies point towards a beneficial effect on depressive and anxiety symptoms, two studies claim no effects on mood, and one reports a positive effect only in patients with major depressive symptoms at baseline. Additional evidence from either retrospective or comparative drug studies indicates no effects of lacosamide on mood. Even though presently, a negative effect on mood seems unlikely, whether lacosamide could exert a beneficial impact on mood remains controversial. Multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind studies are needed to assess the impact on lacosamide on mood disorders, given the low evidence level (Class III and IV) of currently available studies."

We detected a decrease in structure in translated regions and identified the ribosome as a major remodeler of RNA structure in vivo. In contrast, we found that 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) form highly folded structures in vivo, which can affect gene expression by modulating microRNA activity. Furthermore, dynamic 3'-UTR structures contain RNA-decay elements, such as the regulatory elements in nanog and ccna1, two genes encoding key maternal factors orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition.

The rising interest in R-loops is placing new emphasis on understanding the fundamental physicochemical forces driving their formation and stability. Pioneering work in Escherichia coli revealed that DNA topology, in particular negative DNA superhelicity, plays a key role in driving R-loops. A clear role for DNA sequence was later uncovered. Here, we review and synthesize available evidence on the roles of DNA sequence and DNA topology in controlling R-loop formation and stability. Factoring in recent developments in R-loop modeling and single-molecule profiling, we propose a coherent model accounting for the interplay between DNA sequence and DNA topology in driving R-loop structure formation.

We then tested c-KIT and SCF responses to PRKAR1A introduction and PKA stimulation in adrenocortical cell lines CAR47 and H295R, which were also treated with the KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM). Then, mice xenografted with H295R cells were treated with IM. There was increased c-KIT mRNA expression in PPNAD; IHC showed KIT and SCF immunoreactivity within certain nodular areas in PPNAD. IB data was consistent with IHC and mRNA data. PRKAR1A-deficient CAR47 cells expressed c-KIT; this was enhanced by forskolin and lowered by PRKAR1A reintroduction. Knockdown of PKA's catalytic subunit (PRKACA) by siRNA reduced c-KIT levels. Treatment of the CAR47 cells with IM resulted in reduced cell viability, growth arrest, and apoptosis. Treatment with IM of mice xenografted with H295 cells inhibited further tumor growth. We conclude that c-KIT is expressed in PPNAD, an expression that appears to be dependent on PRKAR1A and/or PKA activity. In a human adrenocortical cell line and its xenografts in mice, c-KIT inhibition decreased growth, suggesting that c-KIT inhibitors may be a reasonable alternative therapy to be tested in PPNAD, when other treatments are not optimal."

We present a patient who developed S\u00e9zary syndrome following the initiation of dupilumab."

JASPAR 2020 comes with a novel collection of unvalidated TF-binding profiles for which our curators did not find orthogonal supporting evidence in the literature. This collection has a dedicated web form to engage the community in the curation of unvalidated TF-binding profiles. Moreover, we created a Q&A forum to ease the communication between the user community and JASPAR curators. Finally, we updated the genomic tracks, inference tool, and TF-binding profile similarity clusters.

In this paper, we demonstrate that MSMEG_1285 interacts with PonA1, a bifunctional penicillin-binding protein involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Deletion of MSMEG_1285 enhances Mycobacterium smegmatis resistance to penicillin antibiotics, a phenotype that is exacerbated by the additional deletion of hbhA. This also led to a substantial decrease in the amounts of porins in the cell wall, which are necessary for the import of small and hydrophilic \u03b2-lactams. Deletion of both MSMEG_1285 and hbhA provoked an over-representation of several enzymes involved in peptidoglycan degradation. Thus, we propose that MSMEG_1285 is part of a protein scaffold, which also involves PonA1 and HbhA, and that it is responsible for the tight regulation of peptidoglycan hydrolysis. This study provides a better understanding of the mycobacterial physiology, which is an essential step for strengthening the action of drugs that specifically target peptidoglycan biosynthesis."

Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines. BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature. BCL11B repressive activity is mediated by the NuRD co-repressor complex. We further demonstrate that re-expression of SPRY1, a repressed target of BCL11B, limits the transformation capacity of Ewing sarcoma cells. These data define a new pathway downstream of EWS/FLI required for oncogenic maintenance in Ewing sarcoma."

We previously identified a disease locus on chromosome 16p12.1-q12.2 with genome-wide significant linkage in a large European Australian family with autosomal dominant inheritance of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and no mutation in known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or dementia genes. Here we demonstrate the segregation of a novel missense variant in CYLD (c.2155A>G, p.M719V) within the linkage region as the genetic cause of disease in this family. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue from two CYLD p.M719V mutation carriers showed widespread glial CYLD immunoreactivity. Primary mouse neurons transfected with CYLDM719V exhibited increased cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 and shortened axons. CYLD encodes a lysine 63 deubiquitinase and CYLD cutaneous syndrome, a skin tumour disorder, is caused by mutations that lead to reduced deubiquitinase activity. In contrast with CYLD cutaneous syndrome-causative mutations, CYLDM719V exhibited significantly increased lysine 63 deubiquitinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test P = 0.005). Overexpression of CYLDM719V in HEK293 cells led to more potent inhibition of the cell signalling molecule NF-\u03baB and impairment of autophagosome fusion to lysosomes, a key process in autophagy. Although CYLD mutations appear to be rare, CYLD's interaction with at least three other proteins encoded by frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes (TBK1, OPTN and SQSTM1) suggests that it may play a central role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Mutations in several frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes, including TBK1, OPTN and SQSTM1, result in a loss of autophagy function. We show here that increased CYLD activity also reduces autophagy function, highlighting the importance of autophagy regulation in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

Methylated ARK(S/T) motifs have recently been identified in other chromatin factors (e.g. linker histone H1.4 and lysine methyltransferase G9a). These are thought to function as peripheral docking sites for the HP1 chromodomain. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. These have putative functions ranging from establishment of histone H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis to regulation of transcription co-repressor complexes. To delineate the biochemical functions of the CDY family chromodomains, we analyzed their specificity of methyllysine recognition. We detected substantial differences among these factors. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. However, point mutations can rescue binding. In support of the in vitro binding properties of the chromodomains, the full-length CDY family proteins exhibit substantial variability in chromatin localization. Our studies underscore the significance of subtle sequence differences in a conserved signaling module for diverse epigenetic regulatory pathways."

Then expression of epidermal differentiation marker (K10 and involucrin), adipogenic markers (PPAR-\u03b32, aP2, perilipin2, and Adipoq), keratinocyte-specific marker (K15), proliferation-related markers (PCNA and Ki67) and autophagy-related factors (Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I) was examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Next, HFSCs were treated with 3-MA, or shRNA against Atg5 or Atg7 to verify the effect of autophagy on differentiation of BMP2-treated HFSCs. Finally, the effect of BMP2 on HFSC differentiation was verified by a mouse wound model. HFSCs overexpressing BMP2 exhibited elevated expression of epidermal differentiation marker, adipogenic markers and autophagy-related factors but inhibited expression of keratinocyte-specific marker and proliferation-related markers. Furthermore, we found that PTEN promoted the differentiation of BMP2-treated HFSCs by inducing autophagy. In vivo experiments further confirmed the roles of BMP2/PTEN on differentiation of HFSCs. Taken together, BMP2 up-regulated PTEN and consequently induced autophagy to facilitate HFSC differentiation."

Partial loss-of-function variants in genes encoding the EZH2 and EED subunits of the complex lead to overgrowth, macrocephaly, advanced bone age, variable intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. EZH2-associated overgrowth, caused by constitutional heterozygous mutations within Enhancer of Zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), has a phenotypic spectrum ranging from tall stature without obvious intellectual disability or dysmorphic features to classical Weaver syndrome (OMIM #277590). EED-associated overgrowth (Cohen-Gibson syndrome; OMIM #617561) is caused by germline heterozygous mutations in Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED), and manifests overgrowth and intellectual disability (OGID), along with other features similar to Weaver syndrome. Most recently, rare coding variants in SUZ12 have also been described that present with clinical characteristics similar to the previous two syndromes. Here we review the PRC2 complex and clinical syndromes of OGID associated with core components EZH2, EED, and SUZ12."

Nonetheless, the structure-to-function relationship of eukaryotic genomes is still not well understood. Here, we focus on recent work highlighting the biophysical and regulatory forces that contribute to the spatial organization of genomes, and we propose that the various conformations that chromatin assumes are not so much the result of a linear hierarchy, but rather of both converging and conflicting dynamic forces that act on it."

R9C PLN hiPSC-CMs display a blunted \u03b2-agonist response and defective calcium handling. In 3D human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs), a blunted lusitropic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation was observed with R9C PLN. hiPSC-CMs harboring the R9C PLN mutation showed activation of a hypertrophic phenotype, as evidenced by expression of hypertrophic markers and increased cell size and capacitance of cardiomyocytes. RNA-seq suggests that R9C PLN results in an altered metabolic state and profibrotic signaling, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis and picrosirius staining of R9C PLN hECTs. The expression of several miRNAs involved in fibrosis, hypertrophy, and cardiac metabolism were also perturbed in R9C PLN hiPSC-CMs. This study contributes to better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of the hereditary R9C PLN mutation in the context of human cardiomyocytes."

Three groups of NI MAbs were identified from their different reactivities with escape mutants. Group 1 antibodies recognized the peptide loop containing residues 344 to 346, which appears to be an immunodominant region on the rim of the enzyme center of the N8 NA. Group 2 antibodies recognized a novel epitope containing residues 150, 199, 367, 399, and 400 (N2 numbering). From the location of these residues on the three-dimensional structure of the N8 NA, the epitope appears to be located at the interface of two adjacent monomers in the tetrameric NA, one contributing residues 150 and 199 and the other contributing residues 367 and 399 to 400. The available evidence indicates that the MAbs of this group react with the NA only after it is fully assembled. The third group of antibodies recognized the peptide loops containing residues 367 and 399 to 400. All of the amino acid substitutions in N8 escape mutants which affect the NI activity of antibodies were located in the peptide loops known to form epitopes in the N2 and N9 subtypes, indicating that antigenic regions in the NA head inducing NI antibodies appear to be similar among different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The MAbs used in this study will be valuable in studying the role of each N8 NA epitope in host immune defense systems and in the kinetics analysis of the biosynthesis of the enzyme."

However, there has been a long-standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human-specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter."

This work presents relationships between changes in the expression of individual miRNAs and the genes involved in the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK/ERK signalling pathways in primary brain tumours. Herein we present the preliminary results of miR-17-5p and miR-20a (key representatives of the miR-17-92 oncogenic cluster) expression analysis and their connection with signalling pathway activation in two of the most frequent paediatric tumours: medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our study was performed using the microarray and qPCR techniques and showed PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK/ERK among the forefront of the list of pathways with the largest number of genes involved in their activation compared to the control. Predicted target analysis indicated the agents from miR-17-92 cluster within miRNAs regulating activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK/ERK deregulated genes.

We analysed expression of Phgdh in normal and TNBC mammary tissue samples by 2D gel-based proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and show here that high-level expression of Phgdh in mammary epithelial cells is primarily associated with cell lineage, as we found that Phgdh expression was predominant in CK5-positive cells, normal as well as malignant, thus identifying an association of this protein with the basal phenotype. Quantitative IHC analysis of Phgdh expression in normal breast tissue showed high-level expression of Phgdh in normal CK5-positive mammary epithelial cells, indicating that expression of this protein was not associated with malignancy, but rather with cell lineage. However, proteomic profiling of Phgdh showed it to be expressed in two major protein forms, and that the ratio of expression between these variants was associated with malignancy. Overexpression of Phgdh in CK5-positive cell lineages, and differential protein isoform expression, was additionally found in other tissues and cancer types, suggesting that overexpression of Phgdh is generally associated with CK5 cells, and that oncogenic function may be determined by isoform expression.

Conversational speech samples from a convenience sample of 45 adolescents with DS, ages 10 to 20\u00a0years old, were analysed using perceptual and acoustic methods and measures in the Speech Disorders Classification System (SDCS). The SDCS cross-classified participants into five mutually exclusive speech classifications and five mutually exclusive motor speech classifications. For participants meeting criteria for Childhood Dysarthria or for Childhood Dysarthria concurrent with Childhood Apraxia of Speech, the SDCS provided information on participants' percentile status on five subtypes of dysarthria. A total of 97.8% of participants met SDCS criteria for Speech Disorders and 97.8% met criteria for Motor Speech Disorders, including Childhood Dysarthria (37.8%), Speech Motor Delay (26.7%), Childhood Dysarthria and Childhood Apraxia of Speech (22.2%), and Childhood Apraxia of Speech (11.1%). Ataxia was the most prevalent dysarthria subtype. Nearly all participants with DS in the present sample had some type of speech and motor speech disorder, with implications for theory, assessment, prediction, and treatment.

                    "context": "The Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes play crucial roles in development by regulating expression of homeotic and other genes controlling cell fate. Both groups catalyse modifications of chromatin, particularly histone methylation, leading to epigenetic changes that affect gene activity. The trxG antagonizes the function of PcG genes by activating PcG target genes, and consequently trxG mutants suppress PcG mutant phenotypes. We previously identified the ANTAGONIST OF LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (ALP1) gene as a genetic suppressor of mutants in the Arabidopsis PcG gene LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). Here, we show that ALP1 interacts genetically with several other PcG and trxG components and that it antagonizes PcG silencing. Transcriptional profiling reveals that when PcG activity is compromised numerous target genes are hyper-activated in seedlings and that in most cases this requires ALP1. Furthermore, when PcG activity is present ALP1 is needed for full activation of several floral homeotic genes that are repressed by the PcG. Strikingly, ALP1 does not encode a known chromatin protein but rather a protein related to PIF/Harbinger class transposases. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ALP1 is broadly conserved in land plants and likely lost transposase activity and acquired a novel function during angiosperm evolution. Consistent with this, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) show that ALP1 associates, in vivo, with core components of POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2), a widely conserved PcG protein complex which functions as a H3K27me3 histone methyltransferase. Furthermore, in reciprocal pulldowns using the histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF), we identify not only ALP1 and the core PRC2 components but also plant-specific accessory components including EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF1), a transcriptional repressor previously associated with PRC1-like complexes. Taken together our data suggest that ALP1 inhibits PcG silencing by blocking the interaction of the core PRC2 with accessory components that promote its HMTase activity or its role in inhibiting transcription. ALP1 is the first example of a domesticated transposase acquiring a novel function as a PcG component. The antagonistic interaction of a modified transposase with the PcG machinery is novel and may have arisen as a means for the cognate transposon to evade host surveillance or for the host to exploit features of the transposition machinery beneficial for epigenetic regulation of gene activity.

Cellular senescence can be experimentally induced by expression of oncogenes or telomere shortening during serial passage in culture. In vivo, precursor lesions of several cancer types accumulate senescent cells, which are thought to represent a barrier to malignant progression and a response to the aberrant activation of growth signaling pathways by oncogenes (oncogene toxicity). Here, we sought to define gene expression changes associated with cells that bypass senescence induced by oncogenic RAS. In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), oncogenic KRAS induces benign pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), which exhibit features of oncogene-induced senescence. We found that the bypass of senescence in PanINs leads to malignant PDAC cells characterized by gene signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stem cells, and mitochondria. Stem cell properties were similarly acquired in PanIN cells treated with LPS, and in primary fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells that bypassed Ras-induced senescence after reduction of ERK signaling. Intriguingly, maintenance of cells that circumvented senescence and acquired stem cell properties was blocked by metformin, an inhibitor of complex I of the electron transport chain or depletion of STAT3, a protein required for mitochondrial functions and stemness. Thus, our studies link bypass of senescence in premalignant lesions to loss of differentiation, acquisition of stemness features, and increased reliance on mitochondrial functions."

GEMs convert the reactions (related to metabolism, transcription, and translation) that occur in an organism to a mathematical formulation that can be modeled using optimization principles. A variety of genome-scale modeling methods used to interpret multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and meta-omics are reviewed. The ability to interpret omics in the context of biological systems has yielded important findings for human health, environmental biotechnology, bioenergy, and metabolic engineering.

Approximately 5-10% of patients suffer from a monogenic form of PD where autosomal dominant mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35 and autosomal recessive mutations in PINK1, DJ-1, and Parkin cause the disease with high penetrance. Furthermore, recent whole-exome sequencing have described autosomal recessive DNAJC6 mutations in predominately atypical, but also cases with typical PD. In addition, several other genes have been linked to atypical Parkinsonian phenotypes. However, the vast majority of PD is genetically complex, i.e. it is caused by the combined action of common genetic variants in concert with environmental factors. By the application of genome-wide association studies, 26 PD risk loci have been established to date. Similar to other genetically complex diseases, these show only moderate effects on PD risk. Increasing this etiologic complexity, many of the involved genetic and environmental risk factors likely interact in an intricate fashion. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge in PD genetics."

Mutations in the genes for beta-myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein-C, and cardiac troponin T are the most common. Other genes involved are alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac troponin-I, essential and regulatory light chains, alpha-cardiac actin, titin, and alpha-myosin heavy chain. Some mutations are more frequently associated with a given phenotype, but no particular phenotype is mutation specific; in fact, some mutations exhibit highly variable clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic manifestations. This variability in the phenotypic manifestations is probably due to the influence of environmental factors and/or modifier genes. While the aetiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been extensively elucidated, its pathogenesis is not completely understood. Mutated proteins are incorporated in the sarcomere and impair myocyte contractility. This probably triggers the compensatory local release of trophic factors, which influence the development of the typical anatomical features of the disease, with a pathway similar to that observed in secondary, pressure overload hypertrophy."

However, there is great clinical variability in the expression of the syndrome's manifestations, both between and within families. Here we discuss the clinical variability of MFS by describing a large fourgeneration Dutch family with MFS.Results. Nineteen individuals of one family with a single missense FBN1 mutation (c.7916A>G) were identified. The same mutation was found in one unrelated person. Clinical variability was extensive and not all mutation carriers fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MFS. Some patients only expressed mild skeletal abnormalities, whereas aortic root dilation was present in eight patients, an acute type A aortic dissection was recorded in two other patients, and a mitral valve prolapse was present in eight patients. In some patients cardiac features were not present on initial screening, but did however develop over time.Conclusion. MFS is a clinically highly variable syndrome, which means a meticulous evaluation of suspected cases is crucial. Mutation carriers should be re-evaluated regularly as cardiovascular symptoms may develop over time. (Neth Heart J 2010;18:85-9.)."

In the present study, SNAI1 was found to be increased in HLECs during transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b22 (TGF\u2011\u03b22)\u2011induced EMT. Knockdown of SNAI1 by siRNA reversed TGF\u2011\u03b22\u2011induced downregulation of E\u2011cadherin and upregulation of \u03b1\u2011Smooth Muscle Actin. Furthermore, SNAI1 was found to be associated with HDAC1 in the E\u2011cadherin promoter in TGF\u2011\u03b22\u2011treated HLECs. Inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin A and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid could prevent TGF\u2011\u03b22\u2011induced EMT in HLECs. Collectively, SNAI1 interacted with HDAC1 to repress E\u2011cadherin in the TGF\u2011\u03b22\u2011induced EMT in HLECs, suggesting that HDAC inhibitors may have potential therapeutic value for the prevention of EMT in HLECs."

Here, we explored molecular and developmental aspects of imprinting in humans by generating exclusively paternal human androgenetic embryonic stem cells (aESCs) and comparing them with exclusively maternal parthenogenetic ESCs (pESCs) and bi-parental ESCs, establishing a pluripotent cell system of distinct parental backgrounds. Analyzing the transcriptomes and methylomes of human aESCs, pESCs, and bi-parental ESCs enabled the characterization of regulatory relations at known imprinted regions and uncovered imprinted gene candidates within and outside known imprinted regions. Investigating the consequences of uniparental differentiation, we showed the known paternal-genome preference for placental contribution, revealed a similar bias toward liver differentiation, and implicated the involvement of the imprinted gene IGF2 in this process. Our results demonstrate the utility of parent-specific human ESCs for dissecting the role of imprinting in human development and disease."

In most reports, Cushing's syndrome associated with these tumors occurred only in association with liver or lung metastasis. Only one single case of primary uterine cervix carcinoma secreting enough ACTH to induce Cushing's syndrome in the absence of metastatic disease has been described in 1994. Here, we describe a case of cervical small-cell carcinoma presenting with an acute onset of severe hypokalemia in Cushing's syndrome without metastatic disease to distant organs."

The resulting LC-MS/MS data are used to identify peptides and thereby infer proteins present in samples ranging from simple mixtures to very complex proteomes. Bottom-up proteome studies usually involve quantitative comparisons across several or many samples. For either situation, 1D SDS gels represent a simple, widely available technique that can be used to either fractionate complex proteomes or rapidly clean up low microgram samples with minimal losses. After gel separation and staining/destaining, appropriate gel slices are excised, and in-gel reduction, alkylation, and protease digestion are performed. Digests are then processed for LC-MS/MS analysis. Protocols are described for either sample fractionation with high-throughput processing of many samples or simple cleanup without fractionation. An optional strategy is to conduct in-solution reduction and alkylation prior to running gels, which is advantageous when a large number of samples will be separated into large numbers of fractions. Optimization of trypsin digestion parameters and comparison to in-solution protease digestion are also described. \u00a9 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

All these factors combined lead to an increased risk of death caused by cardiovascular conditions in schizophrenic patients. Individuals receiving typical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to have elevated concentrations of antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies. The presence of both antibodies is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism. It is also likely that mental illness is accompanied by increased procoagulant activity. Patients with acute psychosis have been shown to have a statistically significant increase in the concentrations of D-dimer, P-selectin, and in the expression of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. Learning about causes and mechanisms of venous thromboembolism could help to reduce or neutralize the adverse effects of antipsychotic treatment and facilitate the identification of appropriate markers necessary to monitor changes and provide preventive care against hazardous and potentially fatal complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Before atypical neuroleptic treatment is administered to hospitalized patients, all possible risk factors for thromboembolism should be considered to allow the application of lower risk drugs. Also, other preventive measures should be taken into account, including hydration, compression stockings, regular exercise of lower extremities, and low-molecular-weight heparin injections."

However, whether SENP1 plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy and failure is unknown. We investigated whether alteration in SENP1 expression affects cardiomyopathy and the underlying mechanism. In our present study, we found that the expression of SENP1 was induced in mouse and human failing hearts associated with induced expression of mitochondrial genes. SENP1 expression in cardiomyocytes was induced by hypertrophic stimuli through calcium/calcineurin-NFAT3. SENP1 regulated mitochondrial gene expression by de-SUMOylation of MEF-2C, which enhanced MEF-2C-mediated PGC-1\u03b1 transcription. Genetic induction of SENP1 led to mitochondrial dysregulation and cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Our data showed that pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy is attributed by SENP1 mediated regulation of mitochondrial abnormities. SENP1 up-regulation in diseased heart is mediated via calcineurin-NFAT/MEF2C-PGC-1\u03b1 pathway. "

Focusing in the areas of gene therapy and vaccines the research comprises the development of expression systems, development of cell substrates and cell lines, recombinant virus and viral particles engineering, and development of enabling tools for virus research. After two decades of clinical trials, gene therapy demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of a series of diseases. Currently, several gene therapy products are approved and used in the clinic. Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are one of the most used transfer vehicles to deliver genetic material and the vector of choice to modify hematopoietic cells to correct primary immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies and leukodystrophies. Lentiviral vectors are also widely used to modify T cells to treat cancers in immunotherapies (e.g. chimeric antigen receptors T cell therapies, CAR-T). In genome editing, LVs are used to deliver sequence-specific designer nucleases and DNA templates. The approval of gene therapy products based on LVs (e.g. Kymriah, for B-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment; LentiGlobin\u2122, for \u03b2-thalassemia treatment) reinforced the need to improve their bioprocess manufacturing. Their production has been mostly dependent on transient transfection. Production from stable cell lines facilitate GMP compliant processes, providing an easier scale-up, reproducibility and cost-effective production runs. The establishment of stable LV producer cell lines presents however several difficulties being the cytotoxicity of some of the vector proteins a major challenge. Genome editing technologies poses additional challenges to LV producer cells. Herein we revise the major bottlenecks, recent achievements and perspectives in the development of LV stable cell lines.

Pyroptosis occurs via two pathways: the canonical pathway signaled by caspase-1 and the noncanonical pathway regulated by mouse caspase-11 and human caspases-4/5. All inflammatory caspases activate the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D, but caspase-1 mostly activates the inflammatory cytokine precursors pro-interleukin-18 and pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL18/pro-IL1\u03b2). Here, in vitro cleavage assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that caspase-11 prefers cleaving gasdermin D over the pro-ILs. However, we found that caspase-11 recognizes protein substrates through a mechanism that is different from that of most caspases. Results of kinetics analysis with synthetic fluorogenic peptides indicated that P1'-P4'-the C-terminal gasdermin D region adjacent to the cleavage site-influences gasdermin D recognition by caspase-11. Furthermore, introducing the gasdermin D P1'-P4' region into pro-IL18 enhanced catalysis by caspase-11 to levels comparable to that of gasdermin D cleavage. Pro-IL1\u03b2 cleavage was only moderately enhanced by similar substitutions. We conclude that caspase-11 specificity is mediated by the P1'-P4' region in its substrate gasdermin D, and similar experiments confirmed that the substrate specificities of the human orthologs of caspase-11-i.e. caspases-4 and -5-are ruled by the same mechanism. We propose that P1'-P4'-based inhibitors could be exploited to specifically target inflammatory caspases."

It employs informative visualization tools to display the integrated local and 3D chromatin signatures and effects of somatic mutations on regulatory elements. Enhancer-promoter interactions estimated from chromatin interactions are integrated into a network diffusion system that quantitatively prioritizes somatic mutations and target genes from a large pool.

Selective melatonin receptor agonists Tasimelteon, Ramelteon, and combined melatonergic-serotonin Agomelatine, and other agonists with registered structures in CHEMBL were not yet investigated as cardioprotective or cardiovascular drugs. As drug-able for these therapeutic targets, melatonin receptor agonists have the benefit over melatonin of well-characterized pharmacologic profiles and extensive safety data. Recent reports of the X-ray crystal structures of MT1 and MT2 receptors shall lead to the development of highly selective melatonin receptor agonists. Predictive models using machine learning could help to identify cardiovascular targets for melatonin. Selecting ChEMBL scores > 4.5 in cardiovascular assays, and melatonin scores > 4, we obtained 284 records from 162 cardiovascular assays carried out with 80 molecules with predicted or measured melatonin activity. Melatonin activities (agonistic or antagonistic) found in these experimental cardiovascular assays and models include arrhythmias, coronary and large vessel contractility, and hypertension. Preclinical proof-of-concept and early clinical studies (phase 2a) suggest a cardioprotective benefit from melatonin in various heart diseases. However, larger phase 3 randomized interventional studies are necessary to establish melatonin and its agonists' actions as cardioprotective therapeutic agents."

We describe the 1.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of human parkin in its fully inhibited state and identify the key interfaces to maintain parkin inhibition. We identify the phosphoubiquitin-binding interface, provide a model for the phosphoubiquitin-parkin complex and show how phosphorylation of the Ubl domain primes parkin for optimal phosphoubiquitin binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of phosphoubiquitin leads to displacement of the Ubl domain through loss of structure, unveiling a ubiquitin-binding site used by the E2~Ub conjugate, thus leading to active parkin. We find the role of the Ubl domain is to prevent parkin activity in the absence of the phosphorylation signals, and propose a model for parkin inhibition, optimization for phosphoubiquitin recruitment, release of inhibition by the Ubl domain and engagement with an E2~Ub conjugate. Taken together, this model provides a mechanistic framework for activating parkin."

Like many histone modifying enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) play critical roles in governing cellular behaviors and are indispensable in numerous biological processes. While the association between RNA splicing and histone modifications is beginning to be recognized, a lack of knowledge exists regarding the role of HDACs in splicing. Recent studies however, reveal that HDACs interact with spliceosomal and ribonucleoprotein complexes, actively control the acetylation states of splicing-associated histone marks and splicing factors, and thereby unexpectedly could modulate splicing. Here, we review the role of histone/protein modifications and HDACs in RNA splicing and discuss the convergence of two parallel fields, which supports the argument that HDACs, and perhaps most histone modifying enzymes, are much more versatile and far more complicated than their initially proposed functions. Analogously, an HDAC-RNA splicing connection suggests that splicing is regulated by additional upstream factors and pathways yet to be defined or not fully characterized. Some human diseases share common underlying causes of aberrant HDACs and dysregulated RNA splicing and, thus, further support the potential link between HDACs and RNA splicing."

We demonstrate the importance of 2'-O-Me-regulated translation for cellular growth, differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and show that Npm1 inactivation in adult hematopoietic stem cells results in bone marrow failure. We identify NPM1 germline mutations in patients with dyskeratosis congenita presenting with bone marrow failure and demonstrate that they are deficient in small nucleolar RNA binding.

Study of nine frequently occurring MC1R gene variants in participants without skin cancer (n\u2009=\u2009203) showed that the 'r' Val60Leu variant was significantly associated with high nevus count (>50 nevi) (P\u2009=\u20090.017).

Discontinuous fractional tumor treating fields of an intensity of 0.9 to 1.2 V/cm and a frequency of 150 KHz were applied to U373 cancer cells and IEC6 normal cells for 3 days, with durations of 3, 6, 12, or 24 h/d. As the treatment duration of the tumor treating fields increased from 3 to 24 h/d, the relative tumor cell (U373) number (% of control) reduced in proportion to the treatment duration. Compared to a 25% cell number reduction (75% of control) for the group of 6 h/d treatment at 1.2 V/cm, only 5% (70% of control) and 8% (67% of control) of additional reductions were observed for the group of 12 and 24 h/d treatment, respectively. This experimental result indicates that the dependence on treatment duration in tumor cell inhibition was weakened distinctly at treatment duration over 6 h/d. For normal cells (IEC6), the relative cell number corresponding to the treatment time of the tumor treating fields at 1.2 V/cm of electric field strength was not decreased much for the treatment times of 3, 6, and 12 h/d, revealing 93.3%, 90.0%, and 89.3% relative cell numbers, respectively, but it suddenly decreased to \u223c73% for the 24 h/d treatment. Our results showed that the effects of tumor treating fields on tumor cells were higher than on normal cells for treatment duration of 3 to 12 h/d, but the difference became minimal for treatment duration of 24 h/d. The fractionated scheme, using tumor treating fields, reduced the treatment time while maintaining efficacy, suggesting that this method may be clinically applicable for cancer treatment."

Endothelial cells (ECs) form the linings of the blood vessels, and together with pericytes, are essential for organ development and tissue homeostasis through producing paracrine signalling molecules, called angiocrine factors. In the skeletal system, ECs - derived angiocrine factors, combined with bone cells-released angiogenic factors, orchestrate intercellular crosstalk of the bone microenvironment, and the coupling of angiogenesis-to-osteogenesis. Whilst the involvement of angiogenic factors and the blood vessels of the skeleton is relatively well established, the impact of ECs -derived angiocrine factors on bone and cartilage homeostasis is gradually emerging. In this review, we survey ECs - derived angiocrine factors, which are released by endothelial cells of the local microenvironment and by distal organs, and act specifically as regulators of skeletal growth and homeostasis. These may potentially include angiocrine factors with osteogenic property, such as Hedgehog, Notch, WNT, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Understanding the versatile mechanisms by which ECs-derived angiocrine factors orchestrate bone and cartilage homeostasis, and pathogenesis, is an important step towards the development of therapeutic potential for skeletal diseases."

Consequently, there is a need for additional, new biomarkers for monitoring disease activity and responsiveness to therapy of RA patients. We examined the micro-RNA (miRNA) profile of immune (lymphoid) cells of arthritic Lewis rats and arthritic rats treated with celastrol, a natural triterpenoid. Experimental and bioinformatics analyses revealed 8 miRNAs (miR-22, miR-27a, miR-96, miR-142, miR-223, miR-296, miR-298, and miR-451) and their target genes in functional pathways important for RA pathogenesis. Interestingly, 6 of them (miR-22, miR-27a, miR-96, miR-142, miR-223, and miR-296) were further modulated by celastrol treatment. Interestingly, serum levels of miR-142, miR-155, and miR-223 were higher in arthritic versus control rats, whereas miR-212 showed increased expression in celastrol-treated rats compared with arthritic rats or control rats. This is the first study on comprehensive miRNA expression profiling in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model and it also has revealed new miRNA targets for celastrol in arthritis.

Using this technique (Borohydride Reduction sequencing [BoRed-seq]) alongside RNA immunoprecipitation, we identify m7G within a subset of miRNAs\u00a0that inhibit cell migration. We show that the METTL1 methyltransferase mediates m7G methylation within miRNAs and that this enzyme regulates cell migration via its catalytic activity. Using refined mass spectrometry methods, we map m7G to a single\u00a0guanosine within the let-7e-5p miRNA. We show that METTL1-mediated methylation augments let-7 miRNA processing by disrupting an inhibitory secondary structure within the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). These results identify METTL1-dependent N7-methylation of guanosine as a new RNA modification pathway that regulates miRNA structure, biogenesis, and cell migration."

Homer, one of the most abundant scaffolding proteins in postsynaptic density, interacts with Drebrin's C-terminal PPXXF motifs using its Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain. However, the molecular mechanism and biological function of this interaction remain unclear. Here we show that Homer specifically binds to the first but not the second PPXXF motif in Drebrin. The crystal structure of Drebrin-Homer binding motif 1 in complex with Homer EVH1 reveals a consensus Homer EVH1 binding motif. Homer tetramer promotes actin bundling activity of Drebrin in\u00a0vitro and stimulates Drebrin-induced filopodia formation and elongation in cells. We further show that monomeric Homer1a antagonizes Homer1b in promoting Drebrin-stimulated actin bundling. Our study suggests a potential regulatory role of Homer1 in modulating excitatory synaptic spine homeostatic scaling via binding to Drebrin."

Currently, most technologies for morphological modification are effective only for materials from non-highly-crosslinked proteins and cellulose. Before their morphological change, only water is needed to interrupt hydrogen bonds and ionic linkages, which stabilize the relative positions of molecules in non-highly-crosslinked proteins and cellulose. However, highly crosslinked proteins contain disulfide crosslinks, which are insusceptible to water. Thus, the controlled cleavage of disulfide bonds is required for creating new morphologies of highly crosslinked protein materials, such as hair and wool. Herein, cysteine and citric acid (CA) were used for the two-step setting of highly crosslinked proteins. This recipe showed better morphological change and less mechanical loss than commercial hair styling products. A reaction between CA and keratin was proposed, and verified via NMR and Raman spectra and titration. This technology could be a prospective alternative to achieve durable hair setting, anticrease finishing of wool textiles, and other durable morphological changes needed for highly crosslinked proteins."

We have recently found that NFF reduces excessive alcohol drinking in mice via a KOP-r-mediated mechanism. Here, we further investigated whether NFF alone (1-10\u202f\u03bcg/kg) or in combination with naltrexone (NTX, mu-opioid receptor [MOP-r] antagonist) altered alcohol relapse-like drinking using a mouse alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) paradigm to mimic the relapse episodes in human alcoholics. Nalmefene (NMF, clinically utilized KOP-r partial agonist with MOP-r antagonism) was used as a reference compound for the effects on mouse ADE of new NFF\u202f+\u202fNTX combination. After exposed to 3-week intermittent- access alcohol drinking (two-bottle choice, 24-h access every other day), both male and female mice displayed excessive alcohol intake and then pronounced ADE after 1-week abstinence. NFF prevented the ADE in a dose-dependent manner in both male and female mice. A combination of NFF with NTX reduced the ADE without sex differences at doses lower than those individual effective ones, suggesting synergistic effects between the two compounds. NMF prevented the ADE in both sexes, while selective KOP-r antagonist nor-BNI had no effect. Our new study suggests that a combination of clinically-utilized, potent KOP-r agonist NFF with low-dose NTX has therapeutic potential in alcohol \"relapse\" treatment."

In this study, a candidate gene prioritization method was proposed for non-communicable diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes in weighted disease PPI networks with weights for nodes and edges based on functional information.

Literature review and pathway enrichment analysis of top-ranked genes demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

Bronchial EMT can be triggered by many factors including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). The majority of studies on TGF\u03b21-mediated bronchial EMT used BEGM as the culture medium. LHC-9 medium is another alternative available which is more economical but a less common option. Using normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) cultured in BEGM as a reference, this study aims to validate the induction of EMT by TGF\u03b21 in cells cultured in LHC-9. Briefly, the cells were maintained in either LHC-9 or BEGM, and induced with TGF\u03b21 (5, 10 and 20\u00a0ng/ml) for 48\u00a0h. EMT induction was confirmed by morphological analysis and EMT markers expression by immunoblotting. In both media, cells induced with TGF\u03b21 displayed spindle-like morphology with a significantly higher radius ratio compared to non-induced cells which displayed a cobblestone morphology. Correspondingly, the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin was significantly lower, whereas the mesenchymal marker vimentin expression was significantly higher in induced cells, compared to non-induced cells. By contrast, a slower cell growth rate was observed in LHC-9 compared to that of BEGM. This study demonstrates that neither LHC-9 nor BEGM significantly influence TGF\u03b21-induced bronchial EMT. However, LHC-9 is less optimal for bronchial epithelial cell growth compared to BEGM. Thus, LHC-9 may be a more cost-effective substitute for BEGM, provided that time is not a factor."

Although much work has been done to enhance the performance of question classification into coarse and fine classes in diverse domains, it is still considered a challenging task in the biomedical field. The difficulty in biomedical question classification stems from the fact that one question might have more than one label or expected answer types associated with it (also, referred to as a multi-label classification). In the biomedical domain, only preliminary work is done to classify multi-label questions by transforming them into a single label through copy transformation technique.

We use 780 biomedical questions from BioASQ challenge and assign them appropriate labels.

The double mutant also showed abnormal development of primary motor neurons, hair cell innervation, and reduced leukocytes, consistent with the neuropathy and recurrent infection of the human patients possessing the most severe reductions of PRPS1 activity. Further analyses indicated the phenotypes were associated with a prolonged cell cycle likely resulting from reduced nucleotide synthesis and energy production in the mutant embryos.

The magnetic properties of such particles can be tailored for specific applications with the uniformity of individual beads critical to their function. However, the majority of magnetic characterization techniques quantify the magnetic properties from large bead ensembles. Developing new magnetic imaging techniques to evaluate and visualize the magnetic fields from single beads will allow detailed insight into the magnetic uniformity, anisotropy, and alignment of magnetic domains. Here, diamond-based magnetic microscopy is applied to image and characterize individual magnetic beads with varying magnetic and structural properties: ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic/paramagnetic, shell (coated with magnetic material), and solid (magnetic material dispersed in matrix). The single-bead magnetic images identify irregularities in the magnetic profiles from individual bead populations. Magnetic simulations account for the varying magnetic profiles and allow to infer the magnetization of individual beads. Additionally, this work shows that the imaging technique can be adapted to achieve illumination-free tracking of magnetic beads, opening the possibility of tracking cell movements and mechanics in photosensitive contexts."

The hypothesis proposed here is that mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex leading to mTOR activation result in the specialized LAM cells acquiring many of the cellular characteristics of the normal senescent cell, a state that I propose to characterize as a state of neoplastic senescence. Using this hypothesis as a theoretical basis, many of the enigmatic features of the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of PLAM can be explained.

NOCT is upregulated in early evening and it has been proposed that NOCT serves as a deadenylase for metabolic enzyme mRNAs. We present a 2.7-\u00c5 crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human NOCT. Our structure shows that NOCT has a close overall similarity to CCR4 deadenylase family members, PDE12 and CNOT6L, and to a DNA repair enzyme TDP2. All the key catalytic residues present in PDE12, CNOT6L and TDP2 are conserved in NOCT and have the same conformations. However, we observe substantial differences in the surface properties of NOCT, an unexpectedly narrow active site pocket, and conserved structural elements in the vicinity of the catalytic center, which are unique to NOCT and absent in the deadenylases PDE12/CNOT6L. Moreover, we show that in contrast to human PDE12 and CNOT6L, NOCT is completely inactive against poly-A RNA. Our work thus reveals the structure of an intriguing circadian protein and suggests that NOCT has considerable differences from the related deadenylases, which may point to a unique cellular function of this enzyme."

Histone H2B monoubiquitination has mainly been described as a regulator of transcription elongation, but its role in transcription initiation is poorly documented. We investigated the role of this histone mark (H2Bub1) on different inducible enhancers, in particular those regulated by estrogen receptor \u03b1, by loss- and gain-of-function experiments with the specific E3-ubiquitin ligase complex of H2B: RNF20/RNF40. RNF20/RNF40 overexpression causes repression of the induced activity of these enhancers. Genome-wide profiles show that H2Bub1 levels are negatively correlated with the accessibility of enhancers to transcriptional activators. We found that the chromatin association of histone variant H2A.Z, which is evicted from enhancers for transcriptional activation, is stabilized by H2Bub1 by impairing access of the chromatin remodeler INO80. We propose that H2Bub1 acts as a gatekeeper of H2A.Z eviction and activation of inducible enhancers."

Here we investigated if core clock genes are expressed in human dental pulp-derived cells (DPC) and if their expression is modulated by the hypoxia mimetic agent, L-mimosine (L-MIM), hypoxia or echinomycin. Dental pulp-derived cells in monolayers and spheroids were treated with L-MIM, hypoxia or echinomycin. mRNA levels of the core circadian clock genes were analysed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and their protein levels were analysed by western blot. All core clock genes and proteins were produced in DPC monolayer and spheroid cultures. The expression of cryptochrome circadian regulators and period circadian regulators was reduced by L-MIM, hypoxia and echinomycin at mRNA, but not at protein levels. Time course experiments indicated that modulations were based on alterations in overall mRNA levels of core circadian clock genes. Our results suggest a potential role of the core circadian clock in the response of dental pulp to hypoxia. Future studies need to consider that regulation of the core circadian clock at mRNA levels might not be paralleled by modulation of protein levels."

This report presents the thyroid-disrupting potential of indicated nine BPA analogs from structure-based studies with TBG and TR\u03b1. Each BPA analog formed important polar and hydrophobic interactions with a number of residues of TBG and TR\u03b1. Majority of TBG residues (77-100%) and TR\u03b1 residues (70-91%) interacting with BPA analogs were common with those of native ligands T4 and T3, respectively. Majority of BPA analogs interacted with TBG forming a salt bridge interaction at Lys-270. The hydrogen-bonding interaction of T3 with TR\u03b1 at His-381 was also shared by majority of analogs. The binding energy for BPP, BPB, BPZ, BPAP, and TMBPA with both proteins was closer to binding energy of respective native ligands.

By deconvolution of levels of different cell types in tumour admixtures, we demonstrate that APOBEC3B (A3B), the primary candidate as a cancer mutagen, shows little association with immune cell types compared to its paralogues. We present a pipeline called RESPECTEx (REconstituting SPecific Cell-Type Expression) and use it to deconvolute cell-type specific expression levels in a given cohort of tumour samples. We functionally annotate APOBEC3 co-expressing genes, and create an interactive visualization tool which 'barcodes' the functional enrichment (http://fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/apobec-barcodes/). These analyses reveal that A3B expression correlates with cell cycle and DNA repair genes, whereas the other APOBEC3 members display specificity for immune processes and immune cell populations.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which these histone marks function in chromosome compartmentalization are poorly understood. Constitutive heterochromatin is a largely silent chromosome compartment characterized in part by H3K9me2 and 3. Here, we show that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an H3K9me2 and 3 \"reader,\" interacts with SUV39H1, an H3K9me2 and 3 \"writer,\" and with TRIM28, an abundant HP1 scaffolding protein, to form complexes with increased multivalent engagement of H3K9me2 and 3-modified chromatin. H3K9me2 and 3-marked nucleosomal arrays and associated complexes undergo phase separation to form macromolecule-enriched liquid droplets. The droplets are reminiscent of heterochromatin as they are highly dense chromatin-containing structures that are resistant to DNase and exclude the general transcription factor TFIIB. Our data suggest a general mechanism by which histone marks regulate chromosome compartmentalization by promoting phase separation."

We present a consensus of a group of Spanish neurologists with extensive experience in the clinical management of motor fluctuations. The clinical experience of this group of experts is in line with clinical trials and confirms that opicapone is an effective drug in the control of motor fluctuations, regardless of the daily levodopa dose, or the use of other antiparkinsonian drugs. However, in the opinion of these experts, the ideal patient with Parkinson's disease to initiate treatment with opicapone is the one with mild motor fluctuations, since the ratio between clinical efficacy and adverse effects is more favorable. In general, it is an easy-to-use drug both in those first treated with a COMT inhibitor or those already on entacapone. In any case, the secondary side effects are easily managed."

Functional changes and gene expression in skin were investigated in C57BL/6J mice fed either a control or high-fat diet (HFD). The insulin responsiveness of the skin and skeletal muscle was also evaluated. The effects of inhibiting insulin signaling and altered glucose concentration on skin function-associated molecules and barrier function were analyzed in keratinocytes. HFD-fed mice were not only severely obese, but also exhibited impaired skin barrier function and diminished levels of glycerol transporter aquaporin-3, keratins, and desmosomal proteins involved in maintaining skin structure. Moreover, the expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules was altered. Insulin signaling was attenuated in the skin and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. In keratinocytes, inhibition of insulin signaling leads to decreased keratin expression and diminished barrier function, and higher glucose concentrations increased the expression of CDK inhibitor 1A and 1C, which are associated with cell-cycle arrest. Obesity-associated impairment of skin function can be attributed to structural fragility, abnormal glycerol transport, and dysregulated proliferation of epidermal cells. These alterations are at least partly due to cutaneous insulin resistance and hyperglycemia."

Among these strategies, methods based on pharmacophores (an ensemble of electronic and steric features representing the target active site) are efficient to implement over large compound libraries. However, traditional pharmacophore-based methods require knowledge of active compounds or ligand-receptor structures, and only few ones account for target flexibility. Here, we developed a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol, Flexi-pharma, that overcomes these limitations. The protocol uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore receptor flexibility, and performs a pharmacophore-based virtual screening over a set of MD conformations without requiring prior knowledge about known ligands or ligand-receptor structures for building the pharmacophores. The results from the different receptor conformations are combined using a \"voting\" approach, where a vote is given to each molecule that matches at least one pharmacophore from each MD conformation. Contrarily to other approaches that reduce the pharmacophore ensemble to some representative models and score according to the matching models or molecule conformers, the Flexi-pharma approach takes directly into account the receptor flexibility by scoring in regards to the receptor conformations. We tested the method over twenty systems, finding an enrichment of the dataset for 19 of them. Flexi-pharma is computationally efficient allowing for the screening of thousands of compounds in minutes on a single CPU core. Moreover, the ranking of molecules by vote is a general strategy that can be applied with any pharmacophore-filtering program."

The inversion and dense compaction of heterochromatin converts these nuclei into microlenses that focus light and facilitate nocturnal vision.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray expression analysis were used to show that RUNX1 binds approximately 9,000 target sites in erythroid cells and is primarily active in the undifferentiated state. Functional analysis shows that a subset of the target genes is suppressed by RUNX1 via the newly identified partner MYEF2.

The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the early treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction has been unequivocally proven, and recent results from the GUSTO trial indicate a significant advantage in 30-day survival for alteplase in an accelerated dosage regimen (< or = 100mg infused over 90 minutes rather than 3 hours) over streptokinase. The advantage of the accelerated alteplase dosage regimen seems to be maintained for at least 1 year. The role of heparin as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis remains to be fully defined but heparin administration appears to be more important in conjunction with alteplase than with streptokinase. Ideally, patients should receive alteplase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and, while therapy is most beneficial when administered early, survival is improved when the drug is administered up to 12 hours after symptom onset. The accelerated regimen of alteplase used in the GUSTO trial demonstrated a survival advantage in patients < or = 75 as well as those > 75 years of age which was at least as great as that seen with streptokinase. Similarly, alteplase reduces mortality in patients with both anterior and inferior infarctions; however, those with anterior wall infarctions show an improved outcome over those with inferior infarcts. On the basis of pharmacoeconomic analysis of GUSTO data, the accelerated alteplase regimen cost an estimated additional $US32,678 per year of life saved compared with a conventional streptokinase regimen. Cumulative 1-year costs were greater in patients who received the accelerated alteplase regimen but survival was significantly greater than in patients who received streptokinase. No difference in quality of life was evident in patients who received either treatment. The incidence of major haemorrhage associated with alteplase therapy appears to be similar to that seen with other fibrinolytic agents, increasing with increasing dose; however, the risk of stroke, particularly haemorrhagic stroke, is higher with alteplase than with streptokinase. Thus, alteplase has become firmly established as a first-line option in the management of acute myocardial infarction. On the basis of accumulated evidence, the greatest risk reduction with alteplase therapy may be in certain high risk groups, such as those with anterior infarcts, selected elderly patients and those who present late after symptom onset."

Among the various forms of epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine in the cytosine\u207bguanine (CpG) dinucleotide is one of the most well studied epigenetic modifications. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes involved in generating and maintaining CpG methylation across the genome. In mammalian systems, DNA methylation is performed by DNMT1 and DNMT3s (DNMT3A and 3B).

Additionally, it can take years of development and validation to create a mouse line. In utero electroporation offers a relatively quick and easy method to manipulate gene expression in a cell-type specific manner in vivo that only requires developing a DNA plasmid to achieve a particular genetic manipulation. Bilateral in utero electroporation can be used to target large populations of frontal cortex pyramidal neurons.

Evidence from our laboratory and others suggests that neurotrophin receptors contribute to these disparate behaviors. Previously, the role of TRK receptors in NB pathogenesis was investigated. In the present study, the expression of RET and its co\u2011receptors in a panel of NB cell lines was investigated and responses to cognate ligands GDNF, NRTN, and ARTN with GFR\u03b11\u20113 co\u2011receptor expression, respectively were found to be correlated. RET expression was high in NBLS, moderate in SY5Y, low/absent in NBEBc1 and NLF cells. All cell lines expressed at least one of GFR\u03b1 co\u2011receptors. In addition, NBLS, SY5Y, NBEBc1 and NLF cells showed different morphological changes in response to ligands. As expected, activation of RET/GFR\u03b13 by ARTN resulted in RET phosphorylation. Interestingly, activation of TrkA by its cognate ligand NGF resulted in RET phosphorylation at Y905, Y1015, and Y1062, and this was inhibited in a dose\u2011dependent manner by the TRK inhibitor (CEP\u2011701). Conversely, RET activation by ARTN in NBLS cells led to phosphorylation of TrkA. This suggests a physical association between RET and TRK proteins, and cross\u2011talk between these two receptor pathways. Finally, RET, GFR and TRK expression in primary tumors was investigated and a significant association between RET, its co\u2011receptors and TRK expression was demonstrated. Thus, the present data support a complex model of interacting neurotrophin receptor pathways in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in NBs."

Using PCR-SSCP, DHPLC, and DNA sequencing analysis, we identified a novel single missense mutation associated with Brugada syndrome in the family and detected a C5607T polymorphism in Korean subjects. A single nucleotide substitution of G to A at nucleotide position 3934 changed the coding sense of exon 21 of the SCN5A from glycine to serine (G1262S) in segment 2 of domain III (DIII-S2). Four individuals in the family carried the identical mutation in the SCN5A gene, but none of the 12 sporadic patients did. This mutation was not found in 150 unrelated normal individuals.

Next-generation sequencing technologies complement traditional testing techniques (such as chromosomal fragility and telomere length assessment) and have a broad application in the diagnosis and prognostication of BMF, with the importance of detection of both germline changes and also somatic variants increasingly well understood and appreciated. There is increasing awareness of germline predisposition to haematological malignancy, which incorporates but is not limited to the traditional inherited BMF syndromes and which raises challenges for counselling, monitoring and treatment of people who harbour a germline lesion. There are many benefits to both patients and their kindred of accurate determination of the precise germline change underlying heritable bone marrow diseases, along with its associated mode of inheritance. While individually, these diseases are rare, collectively they are not so and there are many collaborative efforts underway to document the natural history of these disorders, the associated phenotypes and the ever-increasing list of variants which have sufficient evidence to warrant the ascription of a pathogenic classification. We describe the many diagnostic considerations when evaluating newly presenting patients with hypocellular BMF, with a focus on genomic assessment, which is relevant in both germline and acquired diseases."

Recent research suggests that the cristae are the true bioenergetic components of cells. Acetylcholine (ACh), the major neurotransmitter of the vagus nerve, exerts cardio-protective effects against ischaemia. This study investigated the role of cristae remodelling in palmitate (PA)-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and explored the beneficial effects of ACh. We found loose, fragmented and even lysed cristae in PA-treated neonatal cardiomyocytes along with declines in mitochondrial network and complex expression and overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS); these changes ultimately resulted in increased myocardial size. Overexpression of mitofilin by adenoviral infection partly improved cristae shape, mitochondrial network, and ATP content and attenuated cell hypertrophy. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) silencing increased the number of cristae with a balloon-like morphology without disturbing mitofilin expression. Furthermore, AMPK knockdown abolished the effects of mitofilin overexpression on cristae remodelling and inhibited the interaction of mitofilin with sorting and assembly machinery 50 (Sam50) and coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix domain-containing protein 3 (CHCHD3), two core components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. Intriguingly, ACh upregulated mitofilin expression and AMPK phosphorylation via the muscarinic ACh receptor (MAChR). Moreover, ACh enhanced protein-protein interactions between mitofilin and other components of the MICOS complex, thereby preventing PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; however, these effects were abolished by AMPK silencing. Taken together, our data suggest that ACh improves cristae remodelling to defend against PA-induced myocardial hypertrophy, presumably by increasing mitofilin expression and activating AMPK to form the MICOS complex through MAChR. These results suggest new and promising therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondria to prevent lipotoxic cardiomyopathy."

He was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 months after birth, when he failed to thrive and showed symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus. The patient did not exhibit the full set of features to be qualified for any developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes mellitus (DEND) syndrome. Insulin replacement therapy was initiated; however, management was challenged by wide glycemic excursion, hypoglycemic unawareness and insulin-associated cutaneous lipo-hypertrophy. Re-evaluation, including genetic testing, revealed a heterozygous missense p.Arg201Cys variation in the KCNJ11 gene encoding the potassium channel subunit Kir6.2. Successful treatment conversion from insulin to glibenclamide was achieved over an extended period of 2 months (up-titrating to a dose of 1.0\u2009mg/kg) in this patient despite his long diabetes duration of 27 years with elimination of hypoglycemia unawareness and achievement of excellent glycemic control sustained over more than 5 years. This case highlights the importance of after having secured a firm genetic diagnosis, to undertake conversion to sulphonylurea with careful dose titration and perseverance over months. Confirmation of variants with functional implications by genetic testing in patients suspected of neonatal diabetes is important for accurate molecular diagnosis and precision-treatment strategy with optimal outcome."

Current treatment options include corticosteroid therapy, chronic red blood cell transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with gene therapy receiving recent attention. We report the first documented case of Diamond-Blackfan anemia in a Caucasian girl\u00a0secondary to a sporadic heterozygous whole gene deletion in RPL35A in South Africa. Limited resources, non-availability of tests, unfamiliarity that comes with rare diseases, an expanded differential diagnosis, and an associated neutropenia led to a delay in the diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

Our aim in this review is to highlight the recent progress in ET research. The ET-like domain peptide, corresponding to prepro-ET-193-166 , has been proposed to be co-synthesized and released with ET-1, to modulate the actions of the peptide. ET-1 remains the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system with a particularly long-lasting action. To date, the major therapeutic strategy to block the unwanted actions of ET in disease, principally in pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been to use antagonists that are selective for the ETA receptor (ambrisentan) or that block both receptor subtypes (bosentan). Macitentan represents the next generation of antagonists, being more potent than bosentan, with longer receptor occupancy and it is converted to an active metabolite; properties contributing to greater pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic efficacy. A second strategy is now being more widely tested in clinical trials and uses combined inhibitors of ET-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase such as SLV306 (daglutril). A third strategy based on activating the ETB receptor, has led to the renaissance of the modified peptide agonist IRL1620 as a clinical candidate in delivering anti-tumour drugs and as a pharmacological tool to investigate experimental pathophysiological conditions. Finally, we discuss biased signalling, epigenetic regulation and targeting with monoclonal antibodies as prospective new areas for ET research. "

We reviewed the records of 116 patients (51% male) from the Mayo Clinic with histopathologically confirmed SCLC for whom stored serum was available for neural autoantibody testing. Cancer was limited stage in 41%; the median age at diagnosis was 64\u2009years. Paraneoplastic neurological manifestations were recorded in 61% (decreasing frequency: peripheral neuropathy, dysautonomia, cognitive decline, cerebellar ataxia, neuromuscular junction disorder, seizures, cranial neuropathy, movement disorder, brainstem disorder, or myelopathy). Neural autoantibodies, some with pathogenic potential, were detected in the sera of SCLC patients with and without neurological autoimmunity. The most frequent among patients with neurological manifestations were: anti-neuronal nuclear antibody-type 1, voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)-N-type, VGCC-P/Q-type, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), SOX1, and muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR); while the most common in patients without neurological manifestations were: GAD65, muscle-AChR, and VGCC-P/Q-type. Neither cancer stage at diagnosis nor survival correlated with neurological manifestations or autoantibody-positivity, except for shorter survival in patients with myelopathy. The only predictor of longer survival was limited-stage disease at diagnosis."

Experimental methods have provided valuable data to infer protein complexes. However, these methods have inherent limitations. Considering these limitations, many computational methods have been proposed to predict protein complexes, in the last decade. Almost all of these in-silico methods predict protein complexes from the ever-increasing protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. These computational approaches usually use the PPI data in the format of a huge protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) as input and output various sub-networks of the given PPIN as the predicted protein complexes. Some of these methods have already reached a promising efficiency in protein complex detection. Nonetheless, there are challenges in prediction of other types of protein complexes, specially sparse and small ones. New methods should further incorporate the knowledge of biological properties of proteins to improve the performance. Additionally, there are several challenges that should be considered more effectively in designing the new complex prediction algorithms in the future. This article not only reviews the history of computational protein complex prediction but also provides new insight for improvement of new methodologies. In this article, most important computational methods for protein complex prediction are evaluated and compared. In addition, some of the challenges in the reconstruction of the protein complexes are discussed. Finally, various tools for protein complex prediction and PPIN analysis as well as the current high-throughput databases are reviewed."

In this study, we further dissected the above-mentioned QTL by creating a new panel of LOU.BN(chr5) congenic and subcongenic lines and reduced the locus to 5.2 Mb. Then we studied 1,002 heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, whose phenotyping revealed a low prevalence and high variability for RIEL. High-resolution mapping in the HS panel detected the major locus on chromosome 5 (log P > 35) and refined it to 1.4 Mb. Subsequently, RNA-seq analysis on AA of BN, congenics, and LOU revealed expression differences for only protease inhibitor 15 (Pi15) gene and a putative long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) within the linkage region. The high abundance of lincRNA with respect to reduced Pi15 expression, in conjunction with exertion of longitudinal strain, may be related to RIEL, indicating the potential importance of proteases in biological processes related to defective aortic internal elastic lamina structure. Similar mechanisms may be involved in aneurysm initiation in the human AA. "

We believe that testing for BRAF-mutation status should include rare variants of this mutation. From our experience, the high rate of ulceration, male predominance and advanced age at diagnosis are features of melanoma with V600R mutation, which are similar to those reported for V600K mutation. We observed objective response to BRAF/MEK inhibitors in three cases with V600R variant."

The RNA-binding protein CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) binds mRNAs of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and is highly expressed in the liver, where it regulates metabolic plasticity. Here, we show that in primary hepatocytes, CLUH coalesces in specific ribonucleoprotein particles that define the translational fate of target mRNAs, such as Pcx, Hadha, and Hmgcs2, to match nutrient availability. Moreover, CLUH granules play signaling roles, by recruiting mTOR kinase and the RNA-binding proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. Upon starvation, CLUH regulates translation of Hmgcs2, involved in ketogenesis, inhibits mTORC1 activation and mitochondrial anabolic pathways, and promotes mitochondrial turnover, thus allowing efficient reprograming of metabolic function. In the absence of CLUH, a mitophagy block causes mitochondrial clustering that is rescued by rapamycin treatment or depletion of G3BP1 and G3BP2. Our data demonstrate that metabolic adaptation of liver mitochondria to nutrient availability depends on a compartmentalized CLUH-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism that controls both mTORC1 and G3BP signaling and ensures survival."

This study purposes to determine the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by Leifsonia sp. The results demonstrated that cells have a good proliferation ability under the stress of uranium and play a role in retaining uranium in soil. Residual uranium in active Leifsonia-medium group (66%) was higher than that in the controls, which was 31% in the deionised water control, 46% in the Leifsonia group, and 47% in the medium group, respectively. This indicated that Leifsonia sp. facilitates the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by converting part of the reducible and oxidizable fraction of uranium into the residual fraction. X-ray photoelectron fitting results showed that tetravalent states uranium existed in the soil samples, which indicated that the hexavalent uranium was converted into tetravalent by cells. This is the first report of effect of Leifsonia sp. on uranium immobilization in soil. The findings implied that Leifsonia sp. could, to some extent, prevent the migration and diffusion of uranium in soil by changing the chemical states into less toxicity and less risky forms."

Recent studies have shown that repression of regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 2 increases cancer cell growth. However, little is known about whether UHRF1 promotes bladder cancer progression by epigenetic silencing of RGS2. Here, we show that UHRF1 expression is increased in bladder cancer cell lines and in most bladder cancer tissues as compared with normal controls. UHRF1 overexpression increases bladder cancer cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of UHRF1 suppresses cell proliferation. In bladder cancer cells, UHRF1 inhibits RGS2 expression by increasing the methylation of CpG nucleotides of the RGS2 promoter. DNA methylation analysis showed tumor-specific TGS2 promoter methylation in 73% (38/52) of bladder tumors. High UHRF1 expression of correlated with aberrant TGS2 promoter methylation in bladder tumors, which results in the loss of TGS2 expression, as confirmed by demethylation analysis in cell lines. Functionally, re-expression of RGS2 partly abrogates UHRF1-induced bladder cell proliferation. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low TGS2 expression is significantly correlated with reduced overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. These results demonstrate that epigenetic repression of RGS2 by UHRF1 contributes to bladder cancer progression. "

We showed that CCA ubiquitously relies on cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) activity to proliferate. Primary CCA tissues express high levels of cyclin D1 and the specific marker of CDK4/6 activity, phospho-RB Ser780. Treatment of a 15-CCA cell line collection by pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibitors leads to reduced numbers of cells in the S-phase and senescence in most of the CCA cell lines. We found that expression of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is required for activity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor, and that loss of pRB conferred CDK4/6 inhibitor-drug resistance. We also identified that sensitivity of CCA to CDK4/6 inhibition is associated with the activated KRAS signature. Effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibition for CCA was confirmed in the three-dimensional spheroid-, xenograft-, and patient-derived xenograft models. Last, we identified a list of genes whose expressions can be used to predict response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor. Conclusion: We investigated a ubiquitous dependency of CCA on CDK4/6 activity and the universal response to CDK4/6 inhibition. We propose that the CDK4/6-pRB pathway is a suitable therapeutic target for CCA treatment."

They are determined by mutations in genes directly involved in hepcidin regulation, cellular iron uptake, management and export, iron transport and storage. Systemic forms are characterized by increased serum ferritin with or without high transferrin saturation, and with or without functional iron deficient anemia. Hemochromatosis includes five different genetic forms all characterized by high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, but with different penetrance and expression. Mutations in HFE, HFE2, HAMP and TFR2 lead to inadequate or severely reduced hepcidin synthesis that, in turn, induces increased intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release leading to tissue iron overload. The severity of hepcidin down-regulation defines the severity of iron overload and clinical complications. Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations of ferroportin preventing hepcidin-ferroportin binding and leading to hepcidin resistance. Ferroportin disease is due to loss-of-function mutation of SLC40A1 that impairs the iron export efficiency of ferroportin, causes iron retention in reticuloendothelial cell and hyperferritinemia with normal transferrin saturation. Aceruloplasminemia is caused by defective iron release from storage and lead to mild microcytic anemia, low serum iron, and iron retention in several organs including the brain, causing severe neurological manifestations. Atransferrinemia and DMT1 deficiency are characterized by iron deficient erythropoiesis, severe microcytic anemia with high transferrin saturation and parenchymal iron overload due to secondary hepcidin suppression. Diagnosis of the different forms of hereditary iron overload disorders involves a sequential strategy that combines clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic data. Management of iron overload relies on two main therapies: blood removal and iron chelators. Specific therapeutic options are indicated in patients with atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency and aceruloplasminemia."

Neuroticism and tinnitus severity were positively correlated (r\u2009=\u20090.548, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Sleep disorders were observed in 73.2% of patients; however, there was no correlation between the PSQI score and tinnitus severity or between PSQI score and scores of the five NEO-FFI items. Sleep disorders are frequently experienced by patients with chronic tinnitus, regardless of tinnitus severity or personality.

ACE inhibitors block the degradation of BK and substance P by ACE. In addition, an active metabolite of BK (Des-Arg9-BK) is catalysed by kininase I and its degradation is controlled in part by the conversion enzyme. These molecules have been associated with increased plasma extravasation associated with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are the leading cause of drug-induced Angioedema (AE). Symptoms of AE mainly occur after the first month of treatment by ACE. However, very late onset cases, sometimes after several years of stable therapy, are also described in the literature. It has been observed that patients previously stable under ACE inhibitor will most likely develop AE soon after the addition of another medication, including the combination of aspirin or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs with ACE inhibitor which has proved to be the most common cause, accounting for close to 50% of all AE cases related to ACE inhibitors. This side effect of ACE inhibitors, sometimes very late and rare, deserves to be recalled."

Here, we show that Ddx3x regulates hindbrain patterning and development by controlling Hox gene expression and cell stress signaling. In mice predisposed to Wnt- or Shh medulloblastoma, Ddx3x sensed oncogenic stress and suppressed tumor formation. WNT and SHH medulloblastomas normally arise only in the lower and upper rhombic lips, respectively. Deletion of Ddx3x removed this lineage restriction, enabling both medulloblastoma subtypes to arise in either germinal zone. Thus, DDX3X is a medulloblastoma tumor suppressor that regulates hindbrain development and restricts the competence of cell lineages to form medulloblastoma subtypes."

This study is a retrospective analysis of a database of 6000 cases of sudden cardiac death examining commotio cordis in the setting of collapse and death shortly following a blow to the precordium where no structural heart disease was identified at autopsy. Of the 17 cases, 16 were male, and 11 were 18 years old or younger. Eleven occurred whilst playing sport while 6 involved physical interaction including assault. The most common circumstance of death involved a youth being struck in the chest by a ball during sporting activity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cases of commotio cordis in the UK follow a similar circumstantial and age profile to those reported in the United States, and indicates that ball sports such as football, cricket, and rugby expose young participants to a similar risk. There is currently no nation-wide registry of deaths occurring during sporting activity in the UK, and although the true incidence of this condition is not currently known, it is most probably under-recognised and underdiagnosed."

Through reverse-phase protein array and RNAseq we discovered IRAK4 also contributes substantially to MAPK activation in KRAS-mutant PDAC. IRAK4 ablation completely blocked RAS-induced transformation of human and murine cells. Mechanistically, expression of mutant KRAS stimulated an inflammatory, autocrine IL-1b signaling loop that activated IRAK4 and MAPK pathway. Downstream of IRAK4, we uncovered TPL2/MAP3K8 as the essential kinase that propels both MAPK and NF-kB cascades. Inhibition of TPL2 blocked both MAPK and NF-kB signaling, and suppressed KRAS-mutant cell growth. To counter chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress, PDAC cells upregulated TLR9, which activated pro-survival IRAK4-TPL2 signaling. Accordingly, TPL2 inhibitor synergized with chemotherapy to curb PDAC growth in vivo. Finally, from TCGA we characterized two MAP3K8 point mutations that hyperactivate MAPK and NF-kB cascades by impeding TPL2 protein degradation. Cancer cell lines naturally harboring these MAP3K8 mutations are strikingly sensitive to TPL2 inhibition, underscoring the need to identify these potentially targetable mutations in patients. Overall, our study establishes TPL2 as a promising therapeutic target in RAS- and MAP3K8-mutant cancers and strongly prompts development of TPL2 inhibitors for pre-clinical and clinical studies."

The primary outcome was the difference in hair density and diameter, from baseline, between two treatment sides, at week 24. The secondary outcome was a global photographic assessment, evaluated by two dermatologists and the participants. Adverse events were evaluated. Twenty-nine participants completed the 24-week study period. Combination therapy provided significantly superior results for both the primary and secondary outcomes (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). No serious adverse events were identified for either treatment.

Here, we present a microscopy-based screen through which we discovered two FtsZ-binding proteins, FzlA and FzlC. FzlA is conserved in \u03b1-proteobacteria and was found to be functionally critical for cell division in Caulobacter. FzlA altered FtsZ structure both in vivo and in vitro, forming stable higher-order structures that were resistant to depolymerization by MipZ, a spatial determinant of FtsZ assembly. Electron microscopy revealed that FzlA organizes FtsZ protofilaments into striking helical bundles. The degree of curvature induced by FzlA depended on the nucleotide bound to FtsZ. Induction of FtsZ curvature by FzlA carries implications for regulating FtsZ function by modulating its superstructure."

Currently, the browser supports visualising a large number of file formats for genome annotation, variant calling, reads coverage and gene expression. Additionally, the browser supports direct Javascript coding for personalised tracks, providing a whole new level of customisation both functionally and visually. Tracks can be added via direct file upload or processed in real-time via links to files stored remotely on an FTP repository.

The moth exhibits striking sexual dimorphism in wing form; males have functional wings of normal size, whereas females lack wings. We previously found that cell death of the pupal epithelium of females appears to display condensed chromatin within phagocytes. To provide additional detailed data for interpreting the role of cell death, we performed light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assay. We consequently detected two modes of cell death, i.e., dying cells showed both DNA fragmentation derived from epithelial nuclei and autophagic vacuole formation. To elucidate the switching mechanism of sex-specific wing degeneration in females of N. lefuarius, we tested the effects of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) on pupal diapause termination and wing morphogenesis in both sexes. When 20E (5.4 \u00b5g) was injected into both sexes within 2 days of pupation, wing degeneration started 4 days after 20E injection in females, whereas wing morphogenesis and scale formation started 6 days after 20E injection in males. We discuss two important findings: (1) degeneration of the pupal wing epithelium of females was not only due to apoptosis and phagocytotic activation but also to autophagy and epithelial cell shrinkage; and (2) 20E terminated the summer diapause of pupae, and triggered selective programmed cell death only of the female-pupal wing epithelium in the wingless female winter moth.

The loss of function of specific genes caused by genetic alterations in paternal allele causes PWS while the absence in maternal allele results AS. The laboratory diagnosis of PWS and AS is complex and demands molecular biology and cytogenetics techniques to identify the genetic mechanism related to the development of the disease. The DNA methylation analysis in chromosome 15 at the SNURF-SNRPN locus through MS-PCR confirms the diagnosis and distinguishes between PWS and AS. Our study aimed to establish the MS-PCR technique associated with High-Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) in PWS and AS diagnostic with a single pair of primers."

Moreover, DNA methyltransferases may serve as promising therapeutic targets, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have been used for disease treatment. Therefore, the detection of DNA methyltransferases and screening of their inhibitors are crucial for both fundamental biomedical research studies and clinical practice. Due to their excellent size-dependent optical, chemical, electronic, and mechanical features, nanomaterials have been widely used as powerful building materials to construct efficient biosensors for DNA methyltransferase assay with high sensitivity and good selectivity.

Machine learning tools, such as CSI-ANN, ChromHMM, and RFECS, were developed for predicting enhancers using various epigenetic features. However, predictions by different tools vary widely and quite a significant portion of enhancer predictions does not agree. Thus, computational methods for enhancer prediction should be further developed. In this paper, a hybrid neural network called Enhancer-CRNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN), was developed and they were used to predict enhancer regions with histone modification marks as input. The CNN in our model is to reflect local characteristics and the RNN is to learn sequential dependencies among the histone marks. Hybridization of both neural networks outperformed existing prediction tools in experiments with GM12878, H1hesc, HeLaS3, and HepG2 cell lines. On average, 13-17 percent of the enhancers predicted by our method were cell type-specific. With the trained model, optimized virtual input histone marks was generated to provide a deeper insight into how histone modification marks can represent enhancer regions in which histone marks indicate active or repressed enhancers. In summary, our model produced accurate annotation of enhancers with detailed information on how histone profiles contribute to the presence of putative enhancers."

Set7 forms a dimer with its substrate-binding site structurally specific to K37, not the neighboring well-studied K36 mark. We also discovered that H3K37 methylation levels dramatically increase during gametogenesis. Set7 deletion mutant cells show defects in gametogenesis and produce the abnormal number of spores with aberrant morphology. S. pombe gametogenesis shares similarities with mammalian spermatogenesis.

Applying this approach to MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6), which activates the p38 subfamily of MAPKs, we found that decaging active MKK6 in fibroblasts is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in a p38-dependent manner. In both fibroblasts and in a murine melanoma cell line expressing mutant B-Raf, MKK6 activation rapidly and potently inhibited the pro-proliferative extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway; to our surprise, this negative cross-regulation was equally robust when all p38 isoforms were inhibited. These results position MKK6 as a new pleiotropic signal transducer that promotes both pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signaling, and they highlight the utility of caged, light-activated kinases for dissecting stress-activated signaling networks."

The concept of cough hypersensitivity has allowed an umbrella term that explains the exquisite sensitivity of patients to external stimuli such a cold air, perfumes, smoke and bleach. Thus, adults with chronic cough now have a firm physical explanation for their symptoms based on vagal afferent hypersensitivity. Different treatable traits exist with cough variant asthma (CVA)/eosinophilic bronchitis responding to anti-inflammatory treatment and non-acid reflux being treated with promotility agents rather the anti-acid drugs. An alternative antitussive strategy is to reduce hypersensitivity by neuromodulation. Low-dose morphine is highly effective in a subset of patients with cough resistant to other treatments. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also advocated, but in clinical experience they are limited by adverse events. Perhaps the most promising future developments in pharmacotherapy are drugs which tackle neuronal hypersensitivity by blocking excitability of afferent nerves by inhibiting targets such as the ATP receptor (P2X3). Finally, cough suppression therapy when performed by competent practitioners can be highly effective. Children are not small adults and a pursuit of an underlying cause for cough is advocated. Thus, in toddlers, inhalation of a foreign body is common. Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a common and previously unrecognised cause of wet cough in children. Antibiotics (drug, dose and duration need to be determined) can be curative. A paediatric-specific algorithm should be used."

Following initiation, the cell undergoes a period of maturation before becoming a mature cardiomyocyte. We wanted to understand the role of cardiac development transcription factors in the maturation process. We directly reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes by a combination of miRNAs (miR combo). The ability of miR combo to induce cardiomyocyte-specific genes in fibroblasts was lost following the knockdown of the cardiac transcription factors Gata4, Mef2C, Tbx5 and Hand2 (GMTH). To further clarify the role of GMTH in miR combo reprogramming we utilized a modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach to activate endogenous GMTH genes. Importantly, both miR combo and the modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach induced comparable levels of GMTH expression. While miR combo was able to reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells, the modified CRISPR-Cas9 approach could not. Indeed, we found that cardiomyocyte maturation only occurred with very high levels of GMT expression. Taken together, our data indicates that while endogenous cardiac transcription factors are insufficient to reprogram fibroblasts into mature cardiomyocytes, endogenous cardiac transcription factors are necessary for expression of maturation genes."

This result suggested DNA damage was induced during EB treatments. The mutant lacking recA showed the lowest resistance, followed by the mutant lacking Ku and ligD. These findings indicated that recA, Ku and ligD and their associated DNA repair mechanisms, namely, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, play important roles in spore survival under EB treatment. Furthermore, exoA, nfo, uvrAB, splB, polY1 and polY2, which are involved in nucleotide damage repair/removal, showed different levels of effects on spore resistance under EB treatment. Finally, the results suggested that HEEB and LEEB inactivate B. subtilis spores through similar mechanisms. This research will provide a better understanding of how EB technologies inactivate B. subtilis spores and will contribute to the application of these technologies as a non-thermal, gentle spore control approach."

We therefore investigated the role of NBEAL2 in immunity by analyzing the phenotype of Nbeal2-deficient mice. We found profound abnormalities in the Nbeal2-deficient immune system, particularly in the function of neutrophils and NK cells. Phenotyping of Nbeal2-deficient neutrophils showed a severe reduction in granule contents across all granule subsets. Despite this, Nbeal2-deficient neutrophils had an enhanced phagocyte respiratory burst relative to Nbeal2-expressing neutrophils. This respiratory burst was associated with increased expression of cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase complex. Nbeal2-deficient NK cells were also dysfunctional and showed reduced degranulation. These abnormalities were associated with increased susceptibility to both bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) and viral (murine CMV) infection in vivo. These results define an essential role for NBEAL2 in mammalian immunity."

FTO inhibited the self-renewal of ovarian CSC and suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo, both of which required FTO demethylase activity. Integrative RNA-sequencing and m6A mapping analysis revealed significant transcriptomic changes associated with FTO overexpression and m6A loss involving stem cell signaling, RNA transcription, and mRNA splicing pathways. By reducing m6A levels at the 3'UTR and the mRNA stability of two phosphodiesterase genes (PDE1C and PDE4B), FTO augmented second messenger 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling and suppressed stemness features of ovarian cancer cells.

We found that memory disorders, impairment of insulin signaling, and AD-like tauopathies were exhibited in two different STZ-induced mouse models and that the level of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) was increased in two STZ mouse models. Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin reversed the deficits of insulin signaling associated kinases activity, decreased levels of AGEs and AD-like tau phosphorylation, and also improved memory deficit in both STZ mice. Rapamycin attenuated HG-induced tau hyperphosphorylation via the AKT/AMPK/GSK-3\u03b2 pathways and p70S6K in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, these data demonstrated that rapamycin improved STZ-induced AD-like tauopathies and memory deficit in mice via improving p70S6K and AKT/AMPK/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling and decreasing AGEs.

In soleus, MO25 mRNA increased with thyroid hormone treatment, and STRAD mRNA increased with PTU treatment. Phospho-AMPK and phospho-ACC were elevated in soleus and gastrocnemius of hyperthyroid rats. Thyroid hormone treatment also increased the amount of phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the soleus, heart, and red quadriceps. Four proteins having CREB response elements (CRE) in promoter regions of their genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, uncoupling protein 3, cytochrome c, and hexokinase II) were all increased in soleus in response to thyroid hormones.

In designing a treatment strategy, we should not only focus on the results of primary therapy alone but also on the final-overall-eradication rate. The choice of a \"rescue\" treatment depends on which treatment is used initially. If a first-line clarithromycin-based regimen was used, a second-line metronidazole-based treatment (quadruple therapy) may be used afterwards, and then a levofloxacin-based combination would be a third-line \"rescue\" option. Alternatively, it has recently been suggested that levofloxacin-based \"rescue\" therapy constitutes an encouraging 2nd-line strategy, representing an alternative to quadruple therapy in patients with previous PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin failure, with the advantage of efficacy, simplicity and safety. In this case, quadruple regimen may be reserved as a 3rd-line \"rescue\" option.

There are two distinct groups of patients in which therapeutic issues are different. On the one hand, old to very old patients in which PD started at a late age above 80. These patients present with a more severe PD with earlier onsets of cognitive defects and dopa-resistant axial signs, and more comorbidities needing to be taken into account while treating them. Because of their limited life expectancy, these patients would not likely need second line treatments over their disease course. On the other hand, patients presenting with advanced PD, in which fluctuations and dyskinesia induced by dopamine replacement therapy and dopa-resistant axial symptoms impede patient's daily life. These patients are often treated with multiple antiparkinsonian medications, sometimes at high doses. Some patients will also be treated with advanced therapies such as continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel or, more rarely, even subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulations. Because of the specificities of the old to very old parkinsonian patients, tolerance and efficacy of these treatments can be decreased. What is at stake is to aim for the best motor state possible while limiting iatrogenic adverse events. New emerging, potentially less invasive, techniques, such as gamma knife thalamotomy or high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy or sub-thalamotomy, are also discussed here."

Degradation of CP [2-CP, 3-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) or 2,6-DCP] under denitrifying conditions was examined in anaerobic batch culture inoculated with activated sludge. Although 3-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-DCP and 2,6-DCP were not stably degraded, 2-CP was degraded and its degradation capability was sustained in a subculture. However, the rate of 2-CP degradation was not significantly enhanced by subculturing. In 2-CP-degrading cultures, nitrate was consumed stoichiometrically and concomitantly during 2-CP degradation, and a dechlorination intermediate was not detected, suggesting that 2-CP degradation was coupled with nitrate reduction. A 2-CP-degrading enrichment culture degraded 2-CP in the presence of nitrate, but did not in the absence of nitrate or the presence of sulfate. This suggests that the enrichment culture strictly requires nitrate for degradation of 2-CP. The apparent specific growth rate of the 2-CP degrading species was 0.0139 d(-1). Thus the apparent doubling time of the 2-CP-degrading population in the enrichment culture was greater than 50 d, which may explain difficulty in enrichment and isolation of micro-organisms responsible for CP degradation under denitrifying conditions."

Here, we developed a comprehensive human super-enhancer database (SEdb, http://www.licpathway.net/sedb) that aimed to provide a large number of available resources on human super-enhancers. The database was annotated with potential functions of super-enhancers in the gene regulation. The current version of SEdb documented a total of 331 601 super-enhancers from 542 samples. Especially, unlike existing super-enhancer databases, we manually curated and classified 410 available H3K27ac samples from >2000 ChIP-seq samples from NCBI GEO/SRA. Furthermore, SEdb provides detailed genetic and epigenetic annotation information on super-enhancers. Information includes common SNPs, motif changes, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), risk SNPs, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), CRISPR/Cas9 target sites and Dnase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) for in-depth analyses of super-enhancers. SEdb will help elucidate super-enhancer-related functions and find potential biological effects."

Recent reports of original pharmacological properties including modulation of cytokine production (mainly reduced TNF-alpha production) and inhibition of angiogenesis have led to the suggestion that thalidomide may be useful in some inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Several open-label studies and case reports have described the effects of thalidomide in Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, systemic sclerosis, and a few other systemic disorders. In these indications, minor but dose-limiting side effects were apparently common. Thalidomide analogs with better acceptability profiles are under evaluation. The anti-angiogenic effects of thalidomide may make this compound valuable as single-drug therapy or as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with cancer, particularly those with metastases or multiple myeloma. This possibility requires further evaluation."

Intensive control of glucose levels and other risk factors associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome provides the foundations for both preventing and treating diabetic nephropathy. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors represent a highly promising novel class of oral agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus that may be successfully combined with currently available antidiabetic therapeutics in order to achieve blood glucose goals. Beyond glycemic control, emerging evidence suggests that DPP-4 inhibitors may have desirable off-target effects, including renoprotection. All type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with impaired renal function require dose adjustment of any DPP-4 inhibitor administered except for linagliptin, for which renal excretion is a minor elimination pathway. Thus, linagliptin is the drug most frequently chosen to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with renal failure."

High expression of SPAG5 has been frequently detected in breast cancer. However, the biological function and regulatory mechanism of SPAG5 in breast cancer remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential biological function of SPAG5 in breast cancer cells. Herein, we found that both the mRNA and protein expression of SPAG5 were significantly up-regulated in breast cancer cell lines. Functional experiments showed that silencing of SPAG5 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, while the overexpression of SPAG5 promoted the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that SPAG5 promoted the expression of Wnt3 and \u03b2-catenin, and increased the activation of \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity. Notably, the inhibition of Wnt3 partially reversed the promotion effect of SPAG5 on breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion and \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 signalling. In addition, the inhibition of \u03b2-catenin also significantly abrogated SPAG5-mediated oncogenic effects in breast cancer. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SPAG5 promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling via up-regulating Wnt3 expression."

In addition to outdoor workers in places with ongoing, vector-borne transmission who may be exposed when bitten by Zika-infected mosquitoes, biomedical researchers studying the virus and health care workers and staff in clinical laboratories may encounter blood and infectious body fluids from infected individuals, including travelers from Zika virus-affected areas. Because of potentially serious health outcomes, including reproductive effects, sometimes associated with Zika, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health previously issued guidance to help US employers protect workers from exposure to the virus on the job. This commentary summarizes the details of these recommendations and explains their rationale, which is important to understand when adapting and implementing workplace controls to prevent occupational Zika virus exposures and infections at individual worksites.

However, in terms of serological specificities, type V FimA showed a difference from other types of FimA. In addition, type V P. gingivalis bacteria were detected in 16.4% (12 of 73) of the P. gingivalis-positive patients with periodontitis by PCR assay using specific primers.

A large set of co-chaperones comprising J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors regulate the ATPase cycle of Hsp70s, which is allosterically coupled to substrate binding and release. Moreover, Hsp70s cooperate with other cellular chaperone systems including Hsp90, Hsp60 chaperonins, small heat\u00a0shock proteins and Hsp100 AAA+ disaggregases, together constituting a dynamic and functionally versatile network for protein folding, unfolding, regulation, targeting, aggregation and disaggregation, as well as degradation.

Meanwhile, reported immune cell attenuation during HELLP may consequently lead to a prolonged immunoactivation and tissue damage. In this regard, learning more about the immune components of this syndrome should widen the understanding of the HELLP pathophysiology and eventually enable development of novel immune-based therapeutics.

These humanized mice were stably colonized and reproduced the bacterial diversity in donors. Remarkably, performance on Object Location Test and Object Recognition Test was significantly reduced in the latter than in the former at 55\u00a0weeks of age, suggesting that gut microbiota transplanted from an affected patient affects mouse behavior. In addition, metabolites related to the nervous system, including \u03b3-aminobutyrate, taurine, and valine, were significantly less abundant in the feces of mice transplanted with microbiota from the affected patient."

This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of posterior decompression surgery and radiofrequency ablation followed by vertebroplasty in spinal metastasis from lung cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS From June 2008 to September 2015, a retrospective analysis was conducted in 15 patients with spinal metastasis from lung cancer. All cases suffered MESCC and underwent posterior decompression surgery to relieve the compression of spinal cord, and had radiofrequency ablation followed by vertebroplasty. All patients received postoperative multidisciplinary therapy. The operative time, blood loss, complications, pain, neurologic deficit, quality of life, and survival were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS Patients were followed from 6 to 56 months. The mean time of operation was 154\u00b150 minutes and the mean blood loss was 210\u00b190 mL. In the pre-operation analysis found the mean visual analogue scale (VAS) was 7.86\u00b10.86. In the post-operation analysis at 3 months, the mean VAS score was 3.51\u00b11.32. The VAS improved significantly (t=7.95, P<0.01). The Frankel grade was improved 1 grade or 2 grades in 14 patients when pre-operation was compared to post-operation. Only 1 patient kept Frankel grade D after surgery. Eight patients with sphincteric dysfunction preoperatively were improved after surgery. The EORTC QLQ-C30 score was 86.13\u00b18.51 preoperatively and 52.21\u00b113.28 postoperatively. The quality of life was improved significantly (t=11.8, P<0.01). The median survival time was 11 months. CONCLUSIONS Through posterior decompression surgery and radiofrequency ablation followed by vertebroplasty, the quality of life was improved significantly. This palliative treatment was effective and safe in spinal metastasis from lung cancer."

CIDEA and FSP27 are primarily expressed in adipose tissue, while CIDEB is expressed in the liver. Originally, based upon their homology with DNA fragmentation factors, these proteins were identified as apoptotic proteins. However, recent studies have changed the perception of these proteins, redefining them as regulators of lipid droplet dynamics and fat metabolism, which contribute to a healthy metabolic phenotype in humans. Despite various studies in humans and gene-targeting studies in mice, the physiological roles of CIDE proteins remains elusive.

Because bilirubin toxicity involves a myriad of pathological mechanisms, can damage most types of brain cells, and affects brain circuits or loops that influence cognition, learning, behavior, sensory, and language, the clinical effects of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity are likely to be manifold. One possible effect that several experts have identified is bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (subtle kernicterus). However, the underlying biological mechanisms or pathways by which subtle kernicterus could lead to developmental disorders has not been elucidated previously. Our aim in this review is to describe a spectrum of developmental disorders that may reflect subtle kernicterus and outline plausible biological mechanisms for this possible association. We review existing evidence that support or refute the association between unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and developmental disorders, and limitations associated with these studies."

This comparison allowed us to identify the specific features of rotator cuff tears involving the subscapularis tendon. Subscapularis tears were more likely to be related to a shoulder injury and caused more severe functional impairment, as compared to lesions of the other tendons. Time to surgical treatment was shorter when the subscapularis was torn. Subscapularis tears required adaptation of the surgical approach and postoperative protection of external rotation for 4-6 weeks. Outcomes were less satisfactory when the subscapularis tendon was torn. However, the outcomes in both studies were correlated to tear size. The outcomes were often favorable after isolated subscapularis tendon tears and less so when other tendons were involved."

SKI-417616, a highly active representative of this class, displayed activity against all four serotypes of DENV, as well as against a related flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV), and an alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). This compound was characterized to determine its mechanism of antiviral activity. Investigation of the stage of the viral life cycle affected revealed that an early event in the life cycle is inhibited. Due to the structural similarity of the DHBTs to known antagonists of the dopamine and serotonin receptors, we explored the roles of two of these receptors, serotonin receptor 2A (5HTR2A) and the D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4), in DENV infection. Antagonism of DRD4 and subsequent downstream phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related kinase (ERK) were found to impact DENV infection negatively, and blockade of signaling through this network was confirmed as the mechanism of anti-DENV activity for this class of compounds."

The stereoselective plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites were evaluated to understand their potential contributions to bupropion effects. Healthy human volunteers (n = 15) were administered a single oral dose of racemic bupropion (100 mg), which was followed by collection of plasma and urine samples and determination of bupropion and metabolite concentrations using novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays. Time-dependent, elimination rate-limited, stereoselective pharmacokinetics were observed for all bupropion metabolites. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity ratios were on average approximately 65, 6, 6, and 4 and Cmax ratios were approximately 35, 6, 3, and 0.5 for (2R,3R)-/(2S,3S)-hydroxybupropion, R-/S-bupropion, (1S,2R)-/(1R,2S)-erythrohydrobupropion, and (1R,2R)-/(1S,2S)-threohydrobupropion, respectively. The R-/S-bupropion and (1R,2R)-/(1S,2S)-threohydrobupropion ratios are likely indicative of higher presystemic metabolism of S- versus R-bupropion by carbonyl reductases. Interestingly, the apparent renal clearance of (2S,3S)-hydroxybupropion was almost 10-fold higher than that of (2R,3R)-hydroxybupropion. The prediction of steady-state pharmacokinetics demonstrated differential stereospecific accumulation [partial area under the plasma concentration-time curve after the final simulated bupropion dose (300-312 hours) from 185 to 37,447 nM\u22c5h] and elimination [terminal half-life of approximately 7-46 hours] of bupropion metabolites, which may explain observed stereoselective differences in bupropion effect and DDI risk with CYP2D6 at steady state. Further elucidation of bupropion and metabolite disposition suggests that bupropion is not a reliable in vivo marker of CYP2B6 activity. In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report to provide novel insight into mechanisms underlying bupropion disposition by detailing the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of individual bupropion metabolites, which will enhance clinical understanding of bupropion's effects and DDIs with CYP2D6."

In the 2018 release of JASPAR, the CORE collection has been expanded with 322 new PFMs (60 for vertebrates and 262 for plants) and 33 PFMs were updated (24 for vertebrates, 8 for plants and 1 for insects). These new profiles represent a 30% expansion compared to the 2016 release. In addition, we have introduced 316 TFFMs (95 for vertebrates, 218 for plants and 3 for insects). This release incorporates clusters of similar PFMs in each taxon and each TF class per taxon. The JASPAR 2018 CORE vertebrate collection of PFMs was used to predict TF-binding sites in the human genome. The predictions are made available to the scientific community through a UCSC Genome Browser track data hub. Finally, this update comes with a new web framework with an interactive and responsive user-interface, along with new features.

However, an integrative analysis of the effects of PCBs on the liver and pancreas has never been performed for the two major PCB subtypes, dioxin-like (DL) and nondioxin-like (NDL), and a mixture of NDL/DL PCBs. Therefore, male C57BL/6\u202fJ mice fed a control synthetic diet were treated with either a NDL PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260 (20\u202fmg/kg); a single DL PCB congener, PCB 126 (20\u202f\u03bcg/kg); a NDL/DL mixture, Aroclor 1260 plus PCB 126; or vehicle control for 2\u202fweeks. PCB126 had the greatest impact on hepatic lipid metabolism. It caused steatosis due to increased hepatic lipid import with associated hypolipidemia. However, all PCB exposures impacted expression of hepatic lipid metabolism genes in different manners. The 'NASH gene', Pnpla3, was elevated by Aroclor 1260, but decreased by all other exposures. The expression of hepatokines implicated in metabolic syndrome (Fgf21, Igf1, and betatrophin) were differentially regulated. The NDL/DL PCB mixture had the greatest effects on pancreatic histology, including acinar cell atrophy, mild steatosis, and fibrosis without ductal changes or immune cell infiltration. It decreased expression of insulin and altered the expression of genes regulating islet identity. None of these exposures was associated with altered HOMA-IR or HOMA-B. In summary, PCB exposures differentially regulated liver and pancreas structure and function. Novel mechanisms for PCB-induced endocrine/metabolic disruption included altered hepatokines and Pnpla3 as well as 'PCB pancreatopathy' that was associated with altered expression of pancreatic islet identity factors. More research is required to understand fully these findings in the context of human NASH and diabetes."

Actin cytoskeleton dynamics in podocyte foot processes are complex and regulated by multiple proteins and other factors. There are two key signal integration and structural hubs within foot processes that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: the slit diaphragm and focal adhesions. Both modulate actin filament extension as well as foot process mobility. No matter what the initial cause, the final common pathway of podocyte damage is dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton leading to foot process retraction and proteinuria. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton can be due to acquired causes or to genetic mutations in key actin regulatory and signaling proteins. Here, we describe the major structural and signaling components that regulate the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes as well as acquired and genetic causes of actin dysregulation."

Overall and event- free survival (OS and EFS, respectively) of patients with mutant tumors did not differ significantly, neither according to histologic grade (OS p-value\u2009=\u20090.736, EFS p-value\u2009=\u20090.75) nor across anatomical sites (OS p-value\u2009=\u20090.068, EFS p-value\u2009=\u20090.153). Detection of H3K27M mutation in pediatric gliomas provides more precise risk stratification compared to traditional histopathological techniques.

All three carriers presented with a similar percentage of genetically normal sperm cells (i.e., approximately 40%). To visualize NORs, we performed 2D-FISH with directly labelled probes. We used the linear and radial topologies of the nucleus to analyse the NORs distribution. We found an affected positioning of NORs in each case of the Robertsonian translocations. Moreover, the NORs tended to group, most often in two clusters. Both in Robertsonian carriers and control sperm cells, NORs mostly colocalized in the medial areas of the nuclei. In the case of the Roberstonian carriers, NORs were mostly concentrated in the peripheral part of the medial area, in contrast to control sperm cells in which the distribution was more dispersed towards the internal area."

DNA replication is divided into three main stages: initiation, elongation and termination. One of the key events during initiation is the assembly of the replicative helicase at origins of replication, and this mechanism has been very well described over the last decades. In the last six years however, researchers have also focused on deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the disassembly of the replicative helicase during termination. Similar to replisome assembly, the mechanism of replisome disassembly is strictly regulated and well conserved throughout evolution, although its complexity increases in higher eukaryotes. While budding yeast rely on just one pathway for replisome disassembly in S phase, higher eukaryotes evolved an additional mitotic pathway over and above the default S phase specific pathway. Moreover, replisome disassembly has been recently found to be a key event prior to the repair of certain DNA lesions, such as under-replicated DNA in mitosis and inter-strand cross-links (ICLs) in S phase. Although replisome disassembly in human cells has not been characterised yet, they possess all of the factors involved in these pathways in model organisms, and de-regulation of many of them are known to contribute to tumorigenesis and other pathological conditions."

The alcohol sensitivity is associated with a genetic deficiency of ALDH2. We and others have previously reported that such a deficiency influences the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Then we tried to find phenotypes to which the ALDH2 polymorphism contributes by conducting several evaluations including biochemical and functional analyses of various tissues in a community-dwelling population. Several serum proteins, lipids, and lipid peroxides (LPO) levels showed differences between the nondefective (ALDH2*1/1) and defective (ALDH2*1/2 and ALDH2*2/2) ALDH2 individuals. However, alcohol-drinking behavior is known to affect these evaluations. Thus, we excluded the effects of alcohol-drinking behavior from the association with the ALDH2-deficient genotype through correction and found that the concentration of LPO was significantly lower in the nondefective ALDH2 females than the defective females. The effect of frequent alcohol-drinking behavior in males seems to override the phenotype of the high serum LPO level. These results indicate that the ALDH2 deficiency may enhance oxidative stress in vivo. Thus, these findings suggest that ALDH2 functions as a protector against oxidative stress and the decrease in protection may influence the onset of AD, hypertension, and myocardial infarction."

Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) help recruit SWR to promoters; this is thought to position SWR asymmetrically on one side of the\u00a0+1 nucleosome. How SWR accesses the opposite side of\u00a0+1 to generate a ZZ nucleosome remains unclear. Using biochemical assays that monitor the sub-nucleosomal position of nascent H2A.Z, we find that NFR-recruited SWR switches sides to insert H2A.Z into asymmetrically positioned nucleosomes; however, at decreasing temperatures, H2A.Z insertion becomes progressively biased for one side. We find that a 16-bp element containing G/C runs (>3 consecutive G or C nucleotides) is sufficient to promote H2A.Z insertion. Because H2A.Z-rich\u00a0+1 nucleosomes in yeast have more G/C runs, we propose that nucleosome editing is a thermosensitive process that can be hard coded by the genome."

Fluorescent microscopy indicated the uptake of the steroids by both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica, whereas only S. cerevisiae demonstrated conversion of the compounds into 3-O-acetates, likely because 3-O-acetyltransferase Atf2p is present only in its genome.

These are Celsus' four cardinal signs of inflammation that are driven by very well-defined signals and hormones. In fact, targeting the factors that drive this onset phase is the basis upon which most current anti-inflammatory therapies were developed. We are also very well aware that within a few hours, these cardinal signs normally disappear. In other words, inflammation resolves. When it does not, inflammation persists, resulting in damaging chronic conditions. While inflammatory onset is actively driven, so also is its resolution-years of research have identified novel internal counter-regulatory signals that work together to switch off inflammation. Among these signals, lipids are potent signalling molecules that regulate an array of immune responses including vascular hyper reactivity and pain, as well as leukocyte trafficking and clearance, so-called resolution. Here, we collate bioactive lipid research to date and summarize the major pathways involved in their biosynthesis and their role in inflammation, as well as resolution.

Heterozygous WNT1 mutations have been linked to autosomal dominant early-onset osteoporosis. In this study, we describe the clinical and molecular findings in 10 new patients with AR WNT1-related OI.

Signaling downstream from the peptidoglycan receptors is thought to involve K63 ubiquitination and caspase-mediated cleavage, but the molecular mechanisms remain obscure. We now show that PGN stimulation causes caspase-mediated cleavage of the imd protein, exposing a highly conserved IAP-binding motif (IBM) at its neo-N terminus. A functional IBM is required for the association of cleaved IMD with the ubiquitin E3-ligase DIAP2. Through its association with DIAP2, IMD is rapidly conjugated with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. These results mechanistically connect caspase-mediated cleavage and K63 ubiquitination in immune-induced NF-kappaB signaling."

Loss of SMARCB1 protein expression, a core subunit of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, has emerged as a key diagnostic feature of these tumors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this loss remains unclear. We retrospectively identified 20 patients diagnosed with renal medullary carcinoma at two institutions from 1996 to 2017. All patients were confirmed to have sickle cell trait, and all tumors exhibited a loss of SMARCB1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. The status of SMARCB1 locus was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using 3-color probes, and somatic alterations were detected by targeted next-generation sequencing platforms. FISH analysis of all 20 cases revealed 11 (55%) with concurrent hemizygous loss and translocation of SMARCB1, 6 (30%) with homozygous loss of SMARCB1, and 3 (15%) without structural or copy number alterations of SMARCB1 despite protein loss. Targeted sequencing revealed a pathogenic somatic mutation of SMARCB1 in one of these 3 cases that were negative by FISH. Tumors in the 3 subsets with different FISH findings largely exhibited similar clinicopathologic features, however, homozygous SMARCB1 deletion was found to show a significant association with the solid growth pattern, whereas tumors dominated by reticular/cribriform growth were enriched for SMARCB1 translocation. Taken together, we demonstrate that different molecular mechanisms underlie the loss of SMARCB1 expression in renal medullary carcinoma. Biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1 occurs in a large majority of cases either via concurrent hemizygous loss and translocation disrupting SMARCB1 or by homozygous loss."

In contrast, efficacy of filgotinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, in CD patients was demonstrated in the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II FITZROY study. Upadacitinib also showed promising results in a phase II trial in moderate to severe CD. Subsequently, phase III programmes in CD have been initiated for both substances, which are still ongoing. Several newer molecules of this class of orally administrated immunosuppressants are being tested in clinical programmes.

In this narrative review, we elucidate the involvement of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). We also discuss the efficacy of the first- and second-generation JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, peficitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib, solcitinib, itacitinib, decernotinib, R333, and pf-06651600) for CTDs including RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and vasculitis, based on laboratory and clinical research findings. JAK inhibitors have great potential for the treatment of various CTDs by reducing multiple cytokine production and suppressing inflammation, with the advantages of rapid onset in an oral formulation and decreased corticosteroid dependence and the associated adverse events, especially in refractory cases. We also highlight the safety of novel JAK inhibitors, which can cause opportunistic infections, especially viral infections. Being a very recent therapeutic option, information regarding the safety of JAK inhibitors during pregnancy and for pediatric use is limited. However, it is recommended that JAK inhibitors should be avoided in pregnant and breastfeeding women. More clinical data, especially on highly selective inhibitors, are required to judge the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibition in CTDs."

Here, we demonstrate that a versatile extracellular matrix protein, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 induced protein (TGFBIp), promotes lymphatic sprouting in corneal lymphangiogenesis. TGFBIp is highly up-regulated in inflamed mouse corneas. Immunolocalization of TGFBIp is detected in infiltrating macrophages in inflamed mouse corneas. Subconjunctival injection of liposomal clodronate can significantly reduce macrophage infiltration in inflamed mouse cornea, and decrease the expression of TGFBIp and areas of corneal lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis after corneal suture placement. In brief, these results indicate that the up-regulation of TGFBIp in sutured cornea correlates with macrophage infiltration. Although TGFBIp alone cannot significantly stimulate corneal lymph vessel ingrowth in vivo, it can enhance the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor-C in promoting corneal lymphangiogenesis. The in vitro results show that TGFBIp promotes migration, tube formation and adhesion of human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs), but it has no effect on HLECs' proliferation. We also find that the in vitro effect of TGFBIp is mediated by the integrin \u03b15\u03b21-FAK pathway. Additionally, integrin \u03b15\u03b21 blockade can significantly inhibit lymphatic sprouting induced by TGFBIp. Taken together, these findings reveal a new molecular mechanism of lymphangiogenesis in which the TGFBIp-integrin pathways plays a pivotal role in lymphatic sprouting."

This article aims to summarize the efficacy and safety data of tofacitinib for treatment of psoriatic disease. A comprehensive review of literature was conducted on the PubMed database using the search terms: \"((tofacitinib) AND (psoriasis)) OR ((tofacitinib) AND (psoriatic arthritis))\". Data from the pivotal clinical trials evaluating tofacitinib in the treatment of psoriatic disease were summarized. The Oral-treatment Psoriasis Trial (OPT) study series demonstrated that tofacitinib is efficacious in the treatment of plaque psoriasis with an acceptable safety profile. The OPT studies also demonstrated the non-inferiority of tofacitinib 10mg twice daily compared to etanercept. The Oral Psoriatic Arthritis triaL (OPAL) study series demonstrated that tofacitinib significantly improved psoriatic arthritis outcomes compared to placebo and had an acceptable safety profile. Its efficacy is comparable to adalimumab in psoriatic arthritis. Patients treated with tofacitinib should be monitored for herpes zoster, malignancies, blood clots, and changes in laboratory values. Overall, tofacitinib is a useful new systemic agent in the treatment of psoriatic disease. Its oral route of administration, novel JAK pathway target, short half-life, and strong recapture rates after treatment interruption make it a unique new tool for psoriatic disease management. Further long-term studies will help determine its role in the treatment algorithm for psoriatic arthritis and its indication for plaque psoriasis."

In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin whereby auxin directly affects the activity of the atypical auxin response factor (ARF), ETTIN towards target genes without the requirement for protein degradation. Here we show that ETTIN directly binds auxin, leading to dissociation from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and induction of gene expression. This mechanism is reminiscent of animal hormone signalling as it affects the activity towards regulation of target genes and provides the first example of a DNA-bound hormone receptor in plants. Whilst auxin affects canonical ARFs indirectly by facilitating degradation of Aux/IAA repressors, direct ETTIN-auxin interactions allow switching between repressive and de-repressive chromatin states in an instantly-reversible manner."

Anthropometry and fasting lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured in a cohort of 1251 African females participating in the Birth to Twenty cohort study in Soweto, Johannesburg. The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome were 50.1%, 14.3% and 42.1%, respectively. The appropriate waist cut point for diagnosing metabolic syndrome was found to be 91.5 cm and was similar to the cuts points obtained for detecting increased risk of insulin resistance (89.0 cm), dysglycaemia (88.4 cm), hypertension (90.1 cm), hypo-high density lipoproteinaemia (87.6 cm) and hyper-low density lipoproteinaemia (90.5 cm). The present data demonstrates that urban, African females have a high prevalence of obesity and related disorders and the waist cut point currently recommended for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome (80.0 cm) in this population should be increased to 91.5 cm. This latter finding demonstrates a clear ethnic difference in the relationship between abdominal adiposity and metabolic disease risk. The similar waist cut points identified for the detection of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome and related cardiovascular risk factors demonstrates that the risk for different metabolic diseases increases at the same level of abdominal adiposity suggesting a common aetiological pathway."

There is very minor demarcation between ethics and the law. The ethics is promulgated by the professional bodies. All are expected to guide the medical professional in their practice. Medical educators have dual ethical obligations: firstly, to the society at large which expects us to produce competent health professionals, and secondly, to the students under our care. The students observe and copy what their teacher does and his/her role modelling can be a gateway to a student's character building. Due to rapid increase in the number of medical colleges, privatization, and capitalism, ethical issue has become much more relevant and needs to discuss in detail. The present paper discusses the ethics for medical educators in detail with, basic principles, common breaches of ethics and fallacies due to wrong application of ethical principles, and the approach to ethics and methods by which we can prevent and avoid breach of ethics."

The case presented here describes the diagnostic work-up and differentiation of swelling of the parotid gland by employing state-of-the-art ultrasound techniques in a 33-year-old patient with Heerfordt's syndrome. Color-coded duplex ultrasound demonstrated hypervascularization. Tissue harmonic and photopic imaging ultrasound additionally depicted hypoechoic, septated structural lesions of the glandular parenchyma with an optimized contrast. Since such structural changes are not a specific sonographic criterion for sarcoidosis, ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed for further clarification of the etiology of parotitis and for excluding lymphoma. In conclusion, state-of-the-art ultrasound with the option of obtaining a biopsy at low risk is a useful procedure for diagnosing unclear pathology of the parotid gland with rapid histological confirmation."

Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities."

On the basis of this work, we propose an hypothesis on how adrenocortical tumors form and the importance of the cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathway in this process. The regulatory subunit type 1-alpha (RIalpha) of protein kinase A (PKA) (the PRKAR1A gene) is mutated in most patients with Carney complex and primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). Phosphodiesterase-11A (the PDE11A gene) and -8B (the PDE8B gene) mutations were found in patients with isolated adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing syndrome, as well in patients with PPNAD. PKA effects on tumor suppression and/or development and the cell cycle are becoming clear: PKA and/or cAMP act as a coordinator of growth and proliferation in the adrenal cortex. Mouse models in which the respective genes have been knocked out see m to support this notion. Genome-wide searches for other genes responsible for adrenal tumors and related diseases are ongoing; recent evidece of the involvement of the mitochondrial oxidation pathway in adrenocortical tumorigenesis is derived from our study of rare associations such as those of disorders predisposing to adrenomedullary and related tumors (Carney triad, the dyad of paragangliomas and gastric stromal sarcomas or Carney-Stratakis syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome) which appear to be associated with adrenocortical lesions."

However, evidence is emerging that suggests ribosomal proteins are also capable of performing tissue-restricted, regulatory functions that impact normal development and pathological conditions, including cancer. The challenge in studying such regulatory functions is that elimination of many ribosomal proteins also disrupts ribosome biogenesis and/or function. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether developmental abnormalities resulting from ablation of a ribosomal protein result from loss of core ribosome functions or from loss of the regulatory function of the ribosomal protein. Rpl22, a ribosomal protein component of the large 60S subunit, provides insight into this conundrum; Rpl22 is dispensable for both ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis yet its ablation causes tissue-restricted disruptions in development. Here we review evidence supporting the regulatory functions of Rpl22 and other ribosomal proteins. "

Most 10-nucleotide primers yielded strain-specific arrays. Ten Y. pseudotuberculosis type strains were distinguishable from each other by analyzing the RAPD arrays produced by using primers with a 50% G+C content. The RAPD patterns of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were found to be constant regardless of the presence or absence of the large plasmid. RAPD tests were subsequently used to identify 30 clinical isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis that were collected as the causative agent of an outbreak of Izumi fever, a disease showing clinical symptoms characteristic of atypical scarlet fever, in Japan. The RAPD arrays from all of the isolates yielded common patterns that were unique to each primer used. Since those 30 isolates belonged to serotype 5a and the restriction digest patterns of their large plasmids were all the same, the results of the RAPD tests confirmed the view that those isolates were from a single source and indicated that the RAPD test can be practically applied to survey transmission of the bacterium in humans."

Here we used a gain-of-function genetic screen of the kinome to identify new druggable regulators of NRF2 signaling. We found that the understudied protein kinase Brain Specific Kinase 2 (BRSK2) and the related BRSK1 kinases suppress NRF2-dependent transcription and NRF2 protein levels in an activity-dependent manner. Integrated phosphoproteomics and RNAseq studies revealed that BRSK2 drives AMPK signaling and suppresses the mTOR pathway. As a result, BRSK2 kinase activation suppressed ribosome-RNA complexes, global protein synthesis, and NRF2 protein levels. Collectively our data illuminate the BRSK2 and BRSK1 kinases, in part by functionally connecting them to NRF2 signaling and mTOR. This signaling axis may prove useful for therapeutically targeting NRF2 in human disease."

Here, we describe a new class of bispecific antibodies targeting the V2-glycan (apex) and V3-glycan regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). Specifically, bispecific antibodies with a single-chain (scFv) form of the CAP256.VRC26.25 V2-glycan (apex) antibody on one antibody arm and a full V3-glycan Fab on the other arm neutralizes more HIV-1 isolates than the bNAbs from which they were derived. Moreover, these bispecific antibodies are markedly more potent than their parental bNAbs, likely because they simultaneously engage both the apex and V3-glycan epitopes of Env.

However, its origin and genetic mechanisms underlying high-altitude adaptation still remain controversial and enigmatic. Herein, we analyze 229 genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Eurasia, including 63 Tibetan pigs, and detect 49.6 million high-quality variants. Phylogenomic and structure analyses show that Tibetan pigs have a close relationship with low-land domestic pigs in China, implying a common domestication origin. Positively selected genes in Tibetan pigs involved in high-altitude physiology, such as hypoxia, cardiovascular systems, UV damage, DNA repair. Three of loci with strong signals of selection are associated with EPAS1, CYP4F2, and THSD7A genes, related to hypoxia and circulation. We validated four non-coding mutations nearby EPAS1 and CYP4F2 showing reduced transcriptional activity in Tibetan pigs. A high-frequency missense mutation is found in THSD7A (Lys561Arg) in Tibetan pigs. The selective sweeps in Tibetan pigs was found in association with selection against non-coding variants, indicating an important role of regulatory mutations in Tibetan pig evolution. This study is important in understanding the evolution of Tibetan pigs and advancing our knowledge on animal adaptation to high-altitude environments."

Here, we employed a quantitative proteomic approach using various modified peptide baits to identify reader proteins of various acyl modifications. We discovered that proteins harboring HEAT and ARM repeats bind to lysine myristoylated peptides. Recombinant HEAT and ARM repeats bind to myristoylated peptides independent of the peptide sequence or the position of the myristoyl group. Indeed, HEAT and ARM repeats bind directly to medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (MCFA and LCFA). Lipidomic experiments suggest that MCFAs and LCFAs interact with HEAT and ARM repeat proteins in mammalian cells. Finally, treatment of cells with exogenous MCFAs and inhibitors of MCFA-CoA synthases increase the transactivation activity of the ARM repeat protein \u03b2-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest an unappreciated role for fatty acids in the regulation of proteins harboring HEAT or ARM repeats."

Furthermore, epidermolysis bullosa is stratified into several subtypes, which consider the clinical characteristics, the distribution of the blisters, and the severity of cutaneous and extracutaneous signs. Pathogenic variants in at least 16 genes that encode proteins essential for the integrity and adhesion of skin layers have already been associated with different subtypes of epidermolysis bullosa. The marked heterogeneity of the disease, which includes phenotypes with a broad spectrum of severity and many causal genes, hinders its classification and diagnosis. For this reason, dermatologists and geneticists regularly review and update the classification criteria. This review aimed to update the state of the art on inherited epidermolysis bullosa, with a special focus on the associated clinical and genetic aspects, presenting data from the most recent reclassification consensus, published in 2020."

The protocol below outlines a method for high efficiency transfer between bacterial strains of a plasmid harboring a transposon containing a kanamycin resistance marker. The plasmid-borne transposase is encoded by a variant tnp gene that inserts the transposon into the genome of the recipient strain with very low insertional bias. This method thus allows the creation of large mutant libraries in which transposons have been inserted into unique genomic positions in a recipient strain of either Escherichia coli or Shigella flexneri bacteria. By using bacterial conjugation, as opposed to other methods such as electroporation or chemical transformation, large libraries with hundreds of thousands of unique clones can be created. This yields high-density insertion libraries, with insertions occurring as frequently as every 4-6 base pairs in non-essential genes. This method is superior to other methods as it allows for an inexpensive, easy to use, and high efficiency method for the creation of a dense transposon insertion library. The transposon library can be used in downstream applications such as transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq), to infer genetic interaction networks, or more simply, in mutational (forward genetic) screens."

We quantitatively compared the coverage of 'experimentally verified' as well as 'total' (experimentally verified as well as predicted) PPIs for these 16 databases. Coverage was compared in two ways: (a) PPIs obtained in response to gene queries using the web interfaces were compared. As a query set, 108 genes expressed differently across tissues (specific to kidney, testis, and uterus, and ubiquitous - i.e., expressed in 43 human normal tissues) or associated with certain diseases (breast cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy) were chosen. The coverage was also compared for the well-studied genes versus the less-studied ones. The coverage of the databases for high-quality interactions was separately assessed using a set of literature curated experimentally-proven PPIs (gold standard PPI-set); (b) the back-end-data from 15 PPI databases was downloaded and compared. Combined results from STRING and UniHI covered around 84% of 'experimentally verified' PPIs. Approximately 94% of the 'total' PPIs available across the databases were retrieved by the combined use of hPRINT, STRING, and IID. Among the experimentally verified PPIs found exclusively in each database, STRING contributed around 71% of the hits. The coverage of certain databases was skewed for some gene-types. Analysis with the gold-standard PPI-set revealed that GPS-Prot, STRING, APID, and HIPPIE, each covered \u223c70% of the curated interactions.

MTL-CEBPA, a small activating RNA targeting for upregulation of C/EBP\u03b1, is currently being evaluated in a phase 1b trial for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. After dosing, subjects had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and we therefore hypothesized that MTL-CEBPA has anti-inflammatory potential.

CEBPA-51 led to increased expression of the C/EBP\u03b1 gene and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 monocytes previously stimulated by\u00a0E.\u00a0coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment with MTL-CEBPA in an LPS-challenged humanized mouse model upregulated C/EBP\u03b1 mRNA, increased neutrophils, and attenuated production of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3.

Hygienically collected milk samples from healthy women contain a relatively low bacterial load, which consist mostly of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, lactic acid bacteria, and other gram-positive bacteria (Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and Bifidobacterium). DNA from strict anaerobic bacteria is also detected in human milk samples. The origin of human milk bacteria still remains largely unknown. Although the infant's oral cavity and maternal skin may provide microbes to milk, selected bacteria of the maternal digestive microbiota may access the mammary glands through oral- and enteromammary pathways involving interactions with immune cells. In addition, when milk is collected using external devices, such as breast pumps, some microorganisms may arise from unhygienic handling as well as from the water used to clean and rinse the devices, for example. The human milk microbiota has a wide spectrum of potential uses. Most of them have been focused on the infant (including the preterm ones), but some bacterial strains present in human milk have also a big potential to be used to improve the mother's health, mainly through the prevention or treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation."

WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de\u00a0novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability."

Rather than functioning as oncogenic drivers, their induction in tumour cells predominately promotes survival, chemoresistance and motility. The unique mode of maximal activation of this RTK family requires an extracellular lipid\u2013protein complex. For example, the protein ligand, growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), binds to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) that is externalized on apoptotic cell membranes, which activates MERTK on macrophages. This triggers engulfment of apoptotic material and subsequent anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. In tumours, autocrine and paracrine ligands and apoptotic cells are abundant, which provide a survival signal to the tumour cell and favour an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive microenvironment. Thus, TAM kinase inhibition could stimulate antitumour immunity, reduce tumour cell survival, enhance chemosensitivity and diminish metastatic potential."

The study examined the level and function of MAIT cells in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Circulating MAIT cell levels were significantly reduced in IBD patients. This MAIT cell deficiency was correlated with IBD disease activity grades, hemoglobin, and CRP. IFN-\u03b3 production of circulating MAIT cells in response to both MHC class 1b-like related protein (MR1)-dependent and -independent stimulations was decreased in IBD patients, which was partially associated with reduced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1) transcription factor, a main regulator of IFN-\u03b3 production. Expression levels of CD69, programmed death-1 (PD-1), and annexin V in MAIT cells were elevated in IBD patients. CCL20, CXCL10, CXCL16, and CCL25 were expressed higher in inflamed intestinal tissues than in noninflamed tissues. This study demonstrates that circulating MAIT cells are activated and numerically and functionally deficient in IBD patients. Furthermore, activated MAIT cells have the potential to migrate to inflamed tissues. These findings suggest an important role of MAIT cells in mucosal immunity in IBD."

Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection."

After phagocytosis of heat-killed C. albicans, both markers were delivered to more than 95% of phagosomes. After ingestion of viable C. albicans by labeled cells, delivery of AO to phagosomes was highly suppressed (90%), and yet Thorotrast delivery was almost universal. After phagocytosis and 60 min of incubation, about 10 to 20% of the yeasts were killed, and a similar fraction of phagosomes was stained by the fluorescent marker. The evidence from Thorotrast transfer and assessment of yeast viability indicates that C. albicans largely resists intracellular killing by resident macrophages in the face of entirely uninhibited P-LF. We infer that AO must transfer to nearly all of the phagosomes but that it is evidently recognizable only in those in which the yeasts have been killed or possibly severely injured. This conclusion constitutes yet another limitation in the usefulness of AO for studying P-LF."

In cancer cells, STING signaling is frequently impaired by epigenetic silencing of STING; hence, conventional delivery of only its agonist cGAMP may be insufficient to trigger STING signaling. In this work, while expression of STING lacking the transmembrane (TM) domain is known to be unresponsive to STING agonists and is dominant negative when coexpressed with the full-length STING inside cells, we observed that the recombinant TM-deficient STING protein complexed with cGAMP could effectively trigger STING signaling when delivered in vitro and in vivo, including in STING-deficient cell lines. Thus, this bioinspired method using TM-deficient STING may present a universally applicable platform for cGAMP delivery."

The FAK\u2011inhibitor defactinib and the NF\u2011\u03baB inhibitor Bay11\u20117082 attenuated LEC retraction additively, which was similar to the suppression of FAK and PROX1 (the target of SOX18) by the transfection of respective siRNAs. FAK is an effector molecule at the distal end of a pro\u2011metastatic signalling cascade. Therefore, targeting the endothelial\u2011specific activity of FAK through the pathway demonstrated herein may provide a potential therapeutic method to combat cancer dissemination via vascular routes."

However, making this connection between genomic and proteomic information is critical for cancer studies to vaccine development. Furthermore, as we progress towards personalized medicine, it will be essential for proteomics analysis to identify individual mutations and variants in order to fully understand protein networks and to develop personalized therapies. While these advantages are well-established, only a few studies have demonstrated the successful integration of proteomic data with large genomic input. We present and examine the abilities of Bolt, a new cloud-based proteomics search engine to search for the presence of over 2.3 million known cancer mutations in a matter of minutes while still performing a standard proteomics search that includes 31 post translational modifications. We use previously published proteomics data sets and identify mutations that are verified using genomic studies as well as previous proteomics efforts. Our results also emphasize the need to search for mutations in a comprehensive manner while still searching for both common and rare PTMs. SIGNIFICANCE: We present and examine the abilities of Bolt, a new cloud-based proteomics search engine to search for the presence of over 2.3 million known cancer mutations in a matter of minutes while still performing a standard proteomics search that includes 31 post translational modifications.

Tenovin-1 is a sirtuin inhibitor, and here we found that inhibition of sirtuins, but not inhibition of the related histone deacetylases, is potently antiviral against diverse arboviruses. Sirtuin inhibitors block infection of arboviruses in multiple human cell types. We found that sirtuin inhibitors arrest infection downstream of entry but that they do so at an early step, preventing the accumulation of viral RNA and protein. However, sirtuin inhibitors had no impact on the replication of flaviviral replicons, suggesting a defect in the establishment of replication. Consistent with this, we found that sirtuin inhibitors impacted double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation during flaviviral infection. Since these viruses infect vector insects, we also tested whether sirtuin inhibitors impacted infection of adult flies and found that these inhibitors blocked infection; therefore, they target highly conserved facets of replication. Taken together, these results suggest that sirtuin inhibitors represent a new class of potent host-targeting antivirals."

Syndromes that were initially considered include DOORS syndrome, Coffin-Siris syndrome and Dubowitz syndrome. Clinical investigations coupled with karyotype analysis, array-comparative genomic hybridization, exome and Sanger sequencing were performed to characterize the condition in this child. Sanger sequencing was negative for the DOORS syndrome gene TBC1D24 but exome sequencing identified a homozygous deletion in UBE3B (NM_183415:c.3139_3141del, p.1047_1047del) located within the terminal portion of the HECT domain. This finding coupled with the presence of characteristic features such as brachycephaly, ptosis, blepharophimosis, hypertelorism, short palpebral fissures, cleft palate and developmental delay allowed us to make a diagnosis of KOS. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering KOS as a differential diagnosis for patients under evaluation for DOORS syndrome and expand the phenotype of KOS to include small or absent terminal phalanges, nails, and the presence of hallux varus and multicystic dysplastic kidneys."

We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI."

Lectin affinity analysis and 2D gel electrophoresis of uterine samples showed changes in protein glycosylation patterns and the presence of 31 differentially expressed proteins (8 upregulated and 23 downregulated). Mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses of the differential expressed proteins showed lactotransferrin (LTF) as one of the upregulated molecules by LNG. In this study, LTF exhibited significant dose-related effects on sperm functionality, particularly a decrease of calcium ionophore-induced acrosome reaction and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Overall, the results indicated that LNG promoted changes in the proteome of uterine secretions that might compromise human sperm capacitation.

The\u00a0porphyrias are a group of disorders in which enzymatic deficiencies in heme production lead to toxic accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are involved in the neurovisceral attacks. Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity. Givosiran makes use of a new hepatic-delivery system that conjugates three GalNac (N-acetylgalactosamine) molecules to the siRNA passenger strand. GalNac binds to the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor, favoring the internalization of these GalNac-conjugated siRNAs into the hepatic cells. In a phase I study, subcutaneous monthly administration of givosiran 2.5\u00a0mg/kg reduced >\u200990% of ALA and PBG content. This siRNA is being analyzed in ENVISION (NCT03338816), a phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development. The clinical performance of givosiran revealed that suppression of ALAS1 by GalNac-decorated siRNAs represents an additional approach for the treatment of patients with AIP that manifests recurrent acute neurovisceral attacks."

The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities."

To address this need, we assembled a genetic toolkit that allows for an exquisite level of control over the DA neural network in Drosophila. To further refine targeting of specific DA neurons, we also created reagents that allow for the conversion of any existing GAL4 line into Split GAL4 or GAL80 lines. We demonstrated how this toolkit can be used with recently developed computational methods to rapidly generate additional reagents for manipulating small subsets or individual DA neurons.

In paratenic hosts such as mice and humans, T. canis L3 larvae neither moult, grow, nor replicate and will wander through a number of internal organs in humans so as to cause Th2-dominant pathology in various internal organs as leading to neurotoxocariasis (NT), ocular toxocariasis (OT), or visceral larva migrans (VLM). Although the systemic immune response to T. canis has been widely reported, the immune response in the brain has received little attention. Differential cytokine expression and other brain injury-associated biomarkers or neurodegeneration-associated factors have been observed in infected versus uninfected outbred and inbred mice. Preliminary data have also suggested a possible link between significant memory impairment and cytokine production associated with T. canis infection in the hippocampus which has been long recognised as being responsible for learning and memory functions. Notably, it remains an enigma concerning cerebral invasion by T. canis larvae rarely induces a recognisable neurological syndrome or its involvement in neuropathological disorders in humans.

However, no single model can answer all questions and different animal species or different routes of infection can show somewhat different results.

For example, embryonic disruption of the rodent homolog of DYX1C1 disrupts neuronal migration and produces deficits in rapid auditory processing (RAP) and working memory--phenotypes that have been reported to be associated with developmental dyslexia. In the current study we used a modified prepulse inhibition paradigm to assess acoustic discrimination abilities of male Wistar rats following in utero RNA interference targeting Kiaa0319. We also assessed spatial learning and working memory using a Morris water maze (MWM) and a radial arm water maze. We found that embryonic interference with this gene resulted in disrupted migration of neocortical neurons leading to formation of heterotopia in white matter, and to formation of hippocampal dysplasia in a subset of animals. These animals displayed deficits in processing complex acoustic stimuli, and those with hippocampal malformations exhibited impaired spatial learning abilities. No significant impairment in working memory was detected in the Kiaa0319 RNAi treated animals. Taken together, these results suggest that Kiaa0319 plays a role in neuronal migration during embryonic development, and that early interference with this gene results in an array of behavioral deficits including impairments in rapid auditory processing and simple spatial learning."

The glutamate-induced phosphorylation of ERM is calcium-dependent, and inhibition of protein kinase C abolishes ERM phosphorylation as well as RhoA activation. The inhibitions of RhoA and RhoA kinase also diminishes the glutamate-induced ERM phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal cells. The knock-down of moesin or the inhibition of ERM phosphorylation results in the reduction of glutamate-induced filopodia protrusion and diminishes the increase in active synaptic boutons induced by glutamate treatment. These results indicate that glutamate-induced phosphorylation of ERM proteins in primary cultured differentiated hippocampal neurons is mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinase C, RhoA and RhoA kinase, and the phosphorylated ERM protein is necessary for the formation of filopodial protrusion and may be involved in pre-synaptic trafficking."

In this system we analyze growth and intrinsic turnover by means of FRAP measurements and thereby demonstrate how the depletion of monomers and actin binding partners modulate the dynamics in active actin networks. The described effects occur only in dense networks, as single filament dynamics are unable to produce depletion effects to this extent. Furthermore, we demonstrate a synergistic relationship between the nucleators formin and Arp2/3 when branched networks and formin-induced networks are colocalized. As a result, the formin-enhanced filament turnover depletes cofilin at the surface and thus protects the dense, Arp2/3 polymerized network from debranching.

The two proteins interact with one another via the intrinsic RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domains to achieve the negative regulation of p53. The downregulation of p53 is accomplished by Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation through the ubiquitin proteolytic system and by Mdm2 and MdmX mediated inhibition of p53 transactivation. To investigate the role of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX, an analysis of the distinct functionalities of individual RING domains of the Mdm proteins on p53 regulation was conducted in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell line. Mdm2 RING domain was observed mainly localized in the cell nucleus, contrasting the localization of MdmX RING domain in the cytoplasm. Mdm2 RING was found to possess an endogenous E3 ligase activity, whereas MdmX RING did not. Both Mdm2 and MdmX RING domains were able to dimerize with endogenous full-length Mdm2 and MdmX protein and affect their cellular function. The results showed that overexpression of the Mdm2 or MdmX RING domains interfered with the endogenous full-length Mdm2 and MdmX activity and resulted in p53 stabilization and p53 target gene activation. However, both Mdm RING domains showed oncogenic activity in a colony formation assay, suggesting that the Mdm RING domains possess p53-independent oncogenic properties. This study highlights the distinct structural and functional traits of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX and characterized their role in cellular responses through interfering with p53 dependent signaling pathway."
