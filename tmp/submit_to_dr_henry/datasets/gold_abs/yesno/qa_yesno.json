In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance. Diverse models of inheritance, co-existence of numerous genetic disorders and detection of numerous chromosomal aberrations together with involvement of various genes confirm the genetic heterogeneity of Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease might well serve as a model for many complex disorders in which the search for responsible genes has only just been initiated. It seems that the most important role in its genetic etiology plays the RET gene, which is involved in the etiology of at least four diseases. This review focuses on recent advances of the importance of RET gene in the etiology of Hirschsprung disease."

Affinity purified antibodies against this protein localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved evolutionarily."

While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs."

Receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play a central role in differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of PEMF on RANKL and OPG expression in ovariectomized rats. Thirty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated control (Sham), ovariectomy control (OVX), and ovariectomy with PEMF treatment (PEMF). After 12-week interventions, the results showed that PEMF increased serum 17\u03b2-estradiol level, reduced serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase level, increased bone mineral density, and inhibited deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength in OVX rats. Furthermore, PEMF could suppress RANKL expression and improve OPG expression in bone marrow cells of OVX rats. In conclusion, this study suggests that PEMF can prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss through regulating the expression of RANKL and OPG."

Previous ChIP-sequencing studies suggested that these marking patterns reflect the nucleosomal landscape. By analyzing ChIP-chip datasets across the human genome in three cell types, we have found that this marking system is far more complex than previously observed. We show here that a range of histone modifications and Pol II are preferentially associated with exons. However, there is noticeable cell-type specificity in the degree of exon marking by histone modifications and, surprisingly, this is also reflected in some histone modifications patterns showing biases towards introns. Exon-intron marking is laid down in the absence of transcription on silent genes, with some marking biases changing or becoming reversed for genes expressed at different levels. Furthermore, the relationship of this marking system with splicing is not simple, with only some histone modifications reflecting exon usage/inclusion, while others mirror patterns of exon exclusion. By examining nucleosomal distributions in all three cell types, we demonstrate that these histone modification patterns cannot solely be accounted for by differences in nucleosome levels between exons and introns. In addition, because of inherent differences between ChIP-chip array and ChIP-sequencing approaches, these platforms report different nucleosome distribution patterns across the human genome. Our findings confound existing views and point to active cellular mechanisms which dynamically regulate histone modification levels and account for exon-intron marking. We believe that these histone modification patterns provide links between chromatin accessibility, Pol II movement and co-transcriptional splicing."

These were correlated with the expression status of components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b3 subunits of PI3K, phosphorylated (p)-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1, as well as of p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3 and Notch-1, clinicopathological data and patient survival. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. Higher grade meningiomas displayed higher nuclear expression of p-p70S6K; higher nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of p-4E-BP1 and of Notch-1; lower cytoplasmic expression of p85\u03b1PI3K, p-p70S6K and p-ERK1/2; and lower PTEN Histo-scores (H-scores). PTEN H-score was inversely correlated with recurrence probability. In univariate survival analysis, nuclear expression of p-4E-BP1 and absence of p-ERK1/2 expression portended adverse prognosis, whereas in multivariate survival analysis, p-ERK1/2 expression emerged as an independent favourable prognostic factor. Treatment of the human meningioma cell line HBL-52 with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 resulted in reduction of p-AKT, p-p70S6K and p-ERK1/2 protein levels. The complex interactions established between components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, or with components of the MAPK, JAK/STAT and Notch-1 pathways, appear to be essential for facilitating and fuelling meningioma progression."

Thus, it is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Are they sufficiently different in other respects to allow the postulation of locus (rather than allele) heterogeneity? Phenotypic data in both conditions are biased because of ascertainment of propositi, and the apparent differences between them may be entirely artificial as they were between the G and BBB syndromes. On the other hand, the Sotos syndrome may be a cancer syndrome, the Weaver syndrome not (though a neuroblastoma was reported in the latter); in the former there is also remarkably advanced dental maturation rarely commented on in the latter. In Weaver syndrome there are more conspicuous contractures and a facial appearance that experts find convincingly different from that of Sotos individuals. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of locus heterogeneity is testable; at the moment we are inclined to favor the hypothesis of allele heterogeneity.

We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases). Light microscopic, ultrastructural, and immunophenotypic parameters were assessed and compared for both groups. The avidin-biotin complex method was used. All tumors were antigenically intact since all stained for vimentin or at least one marker. Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB. In ESB, an atypical light microscopic appearance correlated with the presence of neuroectodermal features in most cases, but neuroectodermal phenotype was more frequent (68%) than morphological evidence of neuroectodermal differentiation (36%). These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation."

HGF and its cognate receptor c-Met are expressed in cardiac cells during early cardiogenesis, but data concerning its role in cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are limited. In the present study we show that HGF significantly increases the number of beating embryoid bodies of differentiating ESCs without affecting beating frequency. Furthermore, HGF up-regulates the expression of the cardiac-specific transcription factors Nkx 2.5 and GATA-4 and of markers of differentiated cardiomyocytes, i.e. alpha-MHC, beta-MHC, ANF, MLC2v and Troponin T. The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. We conclude that HGF is an important growth factor involved in cardiac differentiation and/or proliferation of ESCs and may therefore be critical for the in vitro generation of pre- or fully differentiated cardiomyocytes as required for clinical use of embryonic stem cells in cardiac diseases."

In the treatment groups, 2 hydrogel electrodes were positioned over Erb's point and lateral to C6 and C7 vertebral spines. A TENS machine was applied for 10 min before the cuff was inflated and remained on for the duration of the pain procedure (12 min). Pain was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) to assess 'current pain intensity' and 'worst pain experienced', respectively. Analysis of VAS scores showed significant differences between groups (ANOVA, P = 0.02), with the TENS-2 group showing a greater hypoalgesic effect than the other groups. One-factor ANOVA showed no significant differences in MPQ scores between groups. The results of this study have provided evidence of the hypoalgesic effects of TENS upon experimental ischaemic pain which were found to be frequency specific with the lower frequency used here (4 Hz) demonstrating the only significant effect."

However, only a limited number of cell types or chromatin marks have previously been investigated for this purpose, leaving the question unanswered whether there exists an optimal set of histone modifications for enhancer prediction in different cell types. Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that RFECS not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction."

Thus, there has been a recent effort to identify new biomarkers that reflect kidney function, early injury, and/or repair that ultimately can relate to progression or regression of damage. Several biomarkers emerged recently that are able to detect kidney damage earlier than is currently possible with traditional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and proteinuria. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

These cis-eQTLs represent potential susceptibility loci underlying physiological and pathophysiological traits manifested in SHR. We have prioritized 60 cis-eQTLs and confirmed differential expression between the parental strains by quantitative PCR in 43 (72%) of the eQTL transcripts. Quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analysis in the RI strains showed highly significant correlation between cis-eQTL transcript abundance and clinically relevant traits such as systolic blood pressure and blood glucose, with the physical location of a subset of the cis-eQTLs colocalizing with \"physiological\" QTLs (pQTLs) for these same traits. These colocalizing correlated cis-eQTLs (c3-eQTLs) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the colocalizing pQTLs. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the c3-eQTL genes identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predicted to affect transcription factor binding affinity, splicing and protein function. These SNPs, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent strong candidate factors underlying not just eQTL expression phenotypes, but also the correlated metabolic and physiological traits. In conclusion, by integration of genomic sequence, eQTL and QTT datasets we have identified several genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological traits observed in the SHR strain. These findings provide a basis for the functional testing and ultimate elucidation of the molecular basis of these metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes."

To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive correlation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC sites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also show that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy between TF motif score and ChIP signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses in wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad21-cohesin haploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large protein-DNA complexes.

FUS is a predominantly nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that is involved in RNA processing. Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration."

By contrast, zebrafish regenerate heart muscle after trauma by inducing proliferation of spared cardiomyocytes, providing a model for identifying manipulations that block or enhance these events. Although direct genetic or chemical screens of heart regeneration in adult zebrafish present several challenges, zebrafish embryos are ideal for high-throughput screening. Here, to visualize cardiomyocyte proliferation events in live zebrafish embryos, we generated transgenic zebrafish lines that employ fluorescent ubiquitylation-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) technology. We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling pathways. Direct examination of heart regeneration after mechanical or genetic ablation injuries indicated that these pathways are activated in regenerating cardiomyocytes and that they can be pharmacologically manipulated to inhibit or enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation during adult heart regeneration. Our findings describe a new screening system that identifies molecules and pathways with the potential to modify heart regeneration."

Among all endogenic factors, biological sub-factors are the significant predictors of happiness. Existence of significant differences in temperament and happiness of infants is an indicator of biological influences. Therefore, this study aimed to consider biological factors that underlie happiness. At the first, all of the biological factors in relation with happiness were searched from following websites: PubMed, Wiley& Sons, Science direct (1990-2014). Then, the articles divided into five sub-groups (genetic, brain and neurotransmitters, endocrinology and hormones, physical health, morphology and physical attractiveness). Finally, a systematic review performed based on existing information. Results of studies on genetic factors indicated an average effectiveness of genetic about 35 -50 percent on happiness. In spite of difficulties in finding special genes, several genes distributed to emotion and mood. Neuroscience studies showed that some part of brain (e.g. amygdala, hipocamp and limbic system) and neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, norepinefrine and endorphin) play a role in control of happiness. A few studies pointed to the role of cortisol and adrenaline (adrenal gland) and oxitocin (pituitary gland) in controlling happiness. Physical health and typology also concluded in most related studies to have a significant role in happiness. Therefore, according to previous research, it can be said that biological and health factors are critical in underlying happiness and its role in happiness is undeniable. "

Ambiguous results were obtained in identifying the replication origins of M. jannaschii based on all theoretical and experimental approaches. In the genome of M. jannaschii, we found that an ORF (MJ0774), annotated as a hypothetical protein, is a homologue of the Cdc6 protein. The position of the gene is at a global minimum of the x component of the Z curve, i.e., RY disparity curve, which has been used to identify replication origins in other Archaea. In addition, an intergenic region (694,540-695,226 bp) that is between the cdc6 gene and an adjacent ORF shows almost all the characteristics of known replication origins, i.e., it is highly rich in AT composition (80%) and contains multiple copies of repeat elements and AT stretches. Therefore, these lines of evidence strongly suggest that the identified region is a replication origin, which is designated as oriC1. The analysis of the y component of the Z curve, i.e., MK disparity curve, suggests the presence of another replication origin corresponding to one of the peaks in the MK disparity curve at around 1,388 kb of the genome."

Additional cancer-related microarray-based tests are either in the process of FDA review or under active development, including Tissue of Tumor Origin and AmpliChip p53. All diagnostic microarray testing is ordered by physicians and tested by a Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendment-certified (CLIA) reference laboratory. Recently, companies offering consumer based microarray testing have emerged. Individuals can order tests online and service providers deliver the results directly to the clients via a password-protected secure website. Navigenics, 23andMe and deCODE Genetics represent pioneering companies in this field. Although the progress of these microarray-based tests is extremely encouraging with the potential to revolutionize the recognition and treatment of common diseases, these tests are still in their infancy and face technical, clinical and marketing challenges. In this article, we review microarray-based tests which are currently approved or under review by the FDA, as well as the consumer-based testing. We also provide a summary of the challenges and strategic solutions in the development and clinical use of the microarray-based tests.

One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. GAGA protein has been shown to localize to the Fab-7 boundary in vivo, and we show that it recognizes sequences from HS1 in vitro. Using two different transgene assays we demonstrate that GAGA-factor-binding sites are necessary but not sufficient for full Fab-7 enhancer-blocking activity. We show that distinct GAGA sites are required for different enhancer-blocking activities at different stages of development.

Amiodarone is a potent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking properties. It is very rich in iodine, with a 100-mg tablet containing an amount of iodine that is 250 times the recommended daily iodine requirement. Amiodarone produces characteristic alterations in thyroid function tests in euthyroid patients. Understanding these alterations is crucial in avoiding unnecessary investigations and treatment. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction occurs because of both its iodine content and the direct toxic effects of the compound on thyroid parenchyma. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is more common in iodine-deficient regions of the world, whereas amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is usually seen in iodine-sufficient areas. In contrast to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat. In this review, we discuss the alterations in thyroid function tests seen in euthyroid subjects, the epidemiology and mechanism of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction, treatment options available, and the consequences of amiodarone use in pregnancy and lactation; and finally, we propose a follow-up strategy in patients taking amiodarone."

Relative to wild-type (WT) animals, Oct3 knockout (KO) mice have displayed altered behavioral and neurochemical responses to psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine. In the present study, both in vitro and in vivo approaches were utilized to explore potential mechanisms underlying the disparate neuropharmacological effects observed following AMPH exposure in Oct3 KO mice. In vitro uptake studies conducted in OCT3 transfected cells indicated that dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH) is not a substrate of OCT3. However, OCT3 was determined to be a high-capacity and low-affinity transporter for the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT). Inhibition studies demonstrated that d-AMPH exerts relatively weak inhibitory effects on the OCT3-mediated uptake of DA, NE, 5-HT, and the model OCT3 substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide. The IC(50) values were determined to be 41.5 +/- 7.5 and 24.1 +/- 7.0 microM for inhibiting DA and 5-HT uptake, respectively, while 50% inhibition of NE and 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide uptake was not achieved by even the highest concentration of d-AMPH applied (100 microM). Furthermore, the disposition of d-AMPH in various tissues including the brain, liver, heart, kidney, muscle, intestine, spleen, testis, uterus, and plasma were determined in both male and female Oct3 KO and WT mice. No significant difference was observed between either genotypes or sex in all tested organs and tissues. Our findings suggest that OCT3 is not a prominent factor influencing the disposition of d-AMPH. Additionally, based upon the inhibitory potency observed in vitro, d-AMPH is unlikely to inhibit the uptake of monoamines mediated by OCT3 in the brain. Differentiated neuropharmacological effects of AMPHs noted between Oct3 KO and WT mice appear to be due to the absence of Oct3 mediated uptake of neurotransmitters in the KO mice."

Cowden syndrome is the only known familial syndrome with an increased risk of both follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and carcinoma (FTC). Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in PTEN, which maps to 10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers within 10q22-24 occurs in about 25%. Recently, another phosphatase gene, MINPP1, has been localized to 10q23.3. MINPP1 has the ability to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates, a function that overlaps that of PTEN. Because of this overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, we considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. We analyzed DNA from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from 23 patients with FA and 15 patients with FTC for LOH and mutations at the MINPP1 locus. LOH was identified in four malignant and three benign tumors. One of these FTCs with LOH was found to harbor a somatic c.122C > T or S41L mutation. We also found two germline sequence variants, c.809A > G (Q270R) and IVS3 + 34T > A. The c.809A > G variant was found in only one patient with FA but not in patients with FTC or normal controls. More interestingly, IVS3 + 34T > A was found in about 15% of FA cases and normal controls but not in patients with FTC. These results suggest a role for MINPP1 in the pathogenesis of at least a subset of malignant follicular thyroid tumors, and MINPP1 might act as a low penetrance predisposition allele for FTC."

The serum concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and oestradiol (E2) were measured during one menstrual cycle in the light training season (autumn) and in the hard training season (spring). The responses of TSH to intravenous TRH stimulation were also measured in the luteal phase of the cycle during the hard training season. Endurance running did not affect the basal or TRH-stimulated serum TSH concentrations, while those of T4 and fT4 in runners were lowered in both seasons and that of T3 in the light training season in relation to control subjects. The serum concentrations of TBG were also significantly lower in runners than their controls in the luteal phase in both seasons. The effect of jogging on thyroid hormones was less pronounced. Serum concentrations of TSH, T4, fT4, T3 and TBG were generally slightly higher in spring than in autumn. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. In spring the function of anterior pituitary-thyroid axis is more active than in autumn."

PET brain imaging of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A)-an enzyme metabolizing neurotransmitters-revealed that MAO A levels vary widely between healthy men and this variability was not explained by the common MAOA genotype (VNTR genotype), suggesting that environmental factors, through epigenetic modifications, may mediate it. Here, we analyzed MAOA methylation in white blood cells (by bisulphite conversion of genomic DNA and subsequent sequencing of cloned DNA products) and measured brain MAO A levels (using PET and [(11)C]clorgyline, a radiotracer with specificity for MAO A) in 34 healthy non-smoking male volunteers. We found significant interindividual differences in methylation status and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter. The VNTR genotype did not influence the methylation status of the gene or brain MAO A activity. In contrast, we found a robust association of the regional and CpG site-specific methylation of the core MAOA promoter with brain MAO A levels. These results suggest that the methylation status of the MAOA promoter (detected in white blood cells) can reliably predict the brain endophenotype. Therefore, the status of MAOA methylation observed in healthy males merits consideration as a variable contributing to interindividual differences in behavior."

We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. GARS is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases responsible for charging tRNA with cognate amino acids; GARS ligates glycine to tRNA(Gly). Here, we present functional analyses of disease-associated GARS mutations and show that there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in GARS expression levels; that the majority of identified GARS mutations modeled in yeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant GARS protein mislocalizes in neuronal cells. Indeed, four of the five mutations studied show loss-of-function features in at least one assay, suggesting that tRNA-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis. Finally, we detected endogenous GARS-associated granules in the neurite projections of cultured neurons and in the peripheral nerve axons of normal human tissue. These data are particularly important in light of the recent identification of CMT-associated mutations in another tRNA synthetase gene [YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene)]. Together, these findings suggest that tRNA-charging enzymes play a key role in maintaining peripheral axons."

Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes."

Dysregulation of microRNAs by several mechanisms has been described in various disease states including cardiac disease. Whereas previous studies of cardiac disease have focused on microRNAs that are primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes, the role of microRNAs expressed in other cell types of the heart is unclear. Here we show that microRNA-21 (miR-21, also known as Mirn21) regulates the ERK-MAP kinase signalling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, which has impacts on global cardiac structure and function. miR-21 levels are increased selectively in fibroblasts of the failing heart, augmenting ERK-MAP kinase activity through inhibition of sprouty homologue 1 (Spry1). This mechanism regulates fibroblast survival and growth factor secretion, apparently controlling the extent of interstitial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. In vivo silencing of miR-21 by a specific antagomir in a mouse pressure-overload-induced disease model reduces cardiac ERK-MAP kinase activity, inhibits interstitial fibrosis and attenuates cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting."

A problem of particular interest is the identification of regions of the genome where different cell types from the same organism exhibit different patterns of histone enrichment. This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data. In this paper we propose a two-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and to find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone modifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state. We find that most of the promoter regions in protein-coding genes have differential histone-modification sites. The software for this work can be downloaded from http://lcbb.epfl.ch/software.html."

Polymorphisms of Ly108 in mice strongly impact central tolerance in both B and T cell development, predominantly by modulating apoptosis, anergy, and cell-cycle progression. In addition, Ly108 and CD84, together with their downstream signaling adaptor SLAM-associated protein (SAP), have emerged as key players in B-T interactions during the formation of germinal centers. Interestingly, several independent lines of research have now associated variations in B-T interactions during germinal center formation with systemic autoimmunity, suggesting that susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve in part the impairment of this peripheral tolerance checkpoint.

Some form of antidote was given to 26 (14.4%) patients with a hemorrhage. Of the patients with at least one major hemorrhage, 19 (41.3%) received an antidote. Vitamin K was given to 23 (1.2%) patients, one (0.05%) patient received protamin sulfate and seven (0.4%) patients received fresh frozen plasma. The use of antidotes was comparable for initial and long-term treatment. Antidotes were statistically significantly more frequently given in Canada as compared to other participating countries. Vitamin K was more frequently given in case of a higher international normalized ratio value. Although antidotes against anticoagulant treatment are widely available, our analysis shows that in only a very small number of patients a direct, or slow-acting antidote to reverse the anticoagulant effect was used."

Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions.

In the isolated rat heart 20-25 microM T(1)AM decreased cardiac contractility, but oxygen consumption and glucose uptake were either unchanged or disproportionately high when compared to mechanical work. In adult rat cardiomyocytes acute exposure to 20 microM T(1)AM decreased the amplitude and duration of the calcium transient. In patch clamped cardiomyocytes sarcolemmal calcium current density was unchanged while current facilitation by membrane depolarization was abolished consistent with reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release. In addition, T(1)AM decreased transient outward current (I(to)) and I(K1) background current. SR studies involving 20 microM T(1)AM revealed a significant decrease in ryanodine binding due to reduced B(max), no significant change in the rate constant of calcium-induced calcium release, a significant increase in calcium leak measured under conditions promoting channel closure, and no effect on oxalate-supported calcium uptake. Based on these observations we conclude T(1)AM affects calcium and potassium homeostasis and suggest its negative inotropic action is due to a diminished pool of SR calcium as a result of increased diastolic leak through the ryanodine receptor, while increased action potential duration is accounted for by inhibition of I(to) and I(K1) currents."

The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion.

The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) adaptor beta-arrestin 2 is also a JNK3 scaffold. It binds the upstream kinases ASK1 and MKK4 and couples stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor AT1aR to activation of a cytoplasmic pool of JNK3. Here we report that MKP7 also binds beta-arrestin 2 via amino acids 394-443 of MKP7, the same region that interacts with JIP-1. This region of MKP7 interacts with beta-arrestin 2 at a central region near the JNK binding domain. MKP7 dephosphorylates JNK3 bound to beta-arrestin 2, either following activation by ASK1 overexpression or following AT1aR stimulation. Initial AT1aR stimulation causes a rapid (within 5 min) dissociation of MKP7 from beta-arrestin 2. MKP7 then reassociates with beta-arrestin 2 on endocytic vesicles 30-60 min after initial receptor stimulation. This dynamic interaction between phosphatase and scaffold permits signal transduction through a module that binds both positive and negative regulators."

This database currently contains 5,010 relevant unique urinary peptides that serve as a pool of potential classifiers for diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases. As an example, by using this source of information, we were able to define urinary peptide biomarkers for chronic kidney diseases, allowing diagnosis of these diseases with high accuracy. Application of the chronic kidney disease-specific biomarker set to an independent test cohort in the subsequent replication phase resulted in 85.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

Nuclear chromatin ultrastructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Cd treatment induced a DNA hypermethylation, as well as an up-regulation of CMT, indicating that de novo methylation did indeed occur. Moreover, a high dose of Cd led to a progressive heterochromatinization of interphase nuclei and apoptotic figures were also observed after long-term treatment. The data demonstrate that Cd perturbs the DNA methylation status through the involvement of a specific methyltransferase. Such changes are linked to nuclear chromatin reconfiguration likely to establish a new balance of expressed/repressed chromatin. Overall, the data show an epigenetic basis to the mechanism underlying Cd toxicity in plants."

This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50-75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits."

Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin.

In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. In embryos explanted on day 10 of gestation and exposed for 24 or 48 hr, the mesenchyme beneath the epithelium of the nasal and maxillary processes contained pyknotic nuclei as well as a dramatically reduced number of nuclei incorporating 3H-thymidine. The secondary palatal processes and the roof of the oral-nasal cavity had fewer mesenchymal cells than control embryos. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into TCA-insoluble macromolecules was 30% less in the retinoid-treated heads. In primary cell cultures from day-12 mouse secondary palatal mesenchyme, subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations."

In both cases power-law-like linearity in double logarithmic scale is found. An evolutionary model, initially put forward for the explanation of a similar pattern found in gene populations is implemented. It includes segmental duplication events and eliminations of most of the duplicated CGIs, while a moderate rate of non-duplicated CGI eliminations is also applied in some cases. Simulations reproduce all the main features of the observed inter-CGI chromosomal size distributions. Our results on power-law-like linearity found in orphan CGI populations suggest that the observed distributional pattern is independent of the analogous pattern that protein coding segments were reported to follow. The power-law-like patterns in the genomic distributions of CGIs described herein are found to be compatible with several other features of the composition, abundance or functional role of CGIs reported in the current literature across several genomes, on the basis of the proposed evolutionary model.

Pretreatment of mouse hepatocytes with a small-molecule inhibitor of AMPK, Compound C (6-[4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-3-pyridin-4-ylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine), abrogated the phosphorylation of ACC following treatment with VPA. The cytochrome P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole blocked the VPA-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK, suggesting a requirement for biotransformation of VPA. In line with this, treatment of hepatocytes with metabolites of VPA resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC as compared with VPA. Treatment of ob/ob mice with VPA for 14 days resulted in decreased liver masses, hepatic fat accumulation, and serum glucose. These results paralleled those observed in mice treated with metformin. In addition, a targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics assay revealed several small molecules that were differentially abundant in the serum of ob/ob mice treated with VPA as compared with vehicle-treated mice.

Bioinformatic analyses of core promoter sequences from 190 genes that are specifically expressed in testes identified a 10 bp A/T-rich motif that is identical to the translational control element (TCE). The TCE functions in the 5' untranslated region of Mst(3)CGP mRNAs to repress translation, and it also functions in a heterologous gene to regulate transcription. We found that among genes with focused initiation patterns, the TCE is significantly enriched in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in testes but not in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in other tissues. The TCE is variably located in core promoters and is conserved in melanogaster subgroup species, but conservation dramatically drops in more distant species. In transgenic flies, short (300-400 bp) genomic regions containing a TCE directed testis-specific transcription of a reporter gene. Mutation of the TCE significantly reduced but did not abolish reporter gene transcription indicating that the TCE is important but not essential for transcription activation. Finally, mutation of testis-specific TFIID (tTFIID) subunits significantly reduced the transcription of a subset of endogenous TCE-containing but not TCE-lacking genes, suggesting that tTFIID activity is limited to TCE-containing genes but that tTFIID is not an obligatory regulator of TCE-containing genes. Thus, the TCE is a core promoter element in a subset of genes that are specifically expressed in testes. Furthermore, the TCE regulates transcription in the context of short genomic regions, from variable locations in the core promoter, and both dependently and independently of tTFIID. These findings set the stage for determining the mechanism by which the TCE regulates testis-specific transcription and understanding the dual role of the TCE in translational and transcriptional regulation."

The mean serum T3 concentration was found to be significantly lower in patients with hepatic coma when compared with euthyroid subjects. In the cases of renal insufficiency the serum T3 concentrations were in the normal range. Due to hormone loss through dialysis however, the mean value of the T3 concentrations was slightly lower than the average concentration of normal subjects. The obtained results agree with those of our earlier studies which showed that there are significant differences between liver artery and vein T3 concentrations in serum, whereas no such differences could be ascertained between serum concentrations in renal artery and vein. On the basis of these findings it is assumed that conversion of T4 into T3 occurs predominantly in the liver."

This supportive microvascular mural cell, plays an important and novel role in cellular and extracellular matrix remodeling in the pancreas and skeletal muscle of young rodent models representing the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Transmission electron microscopy can be used to evaluate these tissues from young rodent models of insulin resistance and T2DM, including the transgenic Ren2 rat, db/db obese insulin resistant - T2DM mouse, and human islet amyloid polypeptide (HIP) rat model of T2DM. With this method, the earliest pancreatic remodeling change was widening of the islet exocrine interface and pericyte hypercellularity, followed by pericyte differentiation into islet and pancreatic stellate cells with early fibrosis involving the islet exocrine interface and interlobular interstitium. In skeletal muscle there was a unique endothelial capillary connectivity via elongated longitudinal pericyte processes in addition to pericyte to pericyte and pericyte to myocyte cell-cell connections allowing for paracrine communication. Initial pericyte activation due to moderate oxidative stress signaling may be followed by hyperplasia, migration, and differentiation into adult mesenchymal cells. Continued robust oxidative stress may induce pericyte apoptosis and impaired cellular longevity. Circulating antipericyte autoantibodies have recently been characterized, and may provide a screening method to detect those patients who are developing pericyte loss and are at greater risk for the development of complications of T2DM due to pericytopathy and rarefaction. Once detected, these patients may be offered more aggressive treatment strategies such as early pharmacotherapy in addition to life style changes targeted to maintaining pericyte integrity. In conclusion, we have provided a review of current knowledge regarding the pericyte and novel ultrastructural findings regarding its role in metabolic syndrome and T2DM."

This interface, consisting of the maternal decidua and the invading placental trophoblast, is exposed to profound changes in oxygen tension during pregnancy. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. However, silencing of FOXO1 did not increase the susceptibility of decidualized cells to oxidative cell death. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. Expression of a constitutively active FOXO3a mutant elicited apoptosis in decidualized cells. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous FOXO3a in undifferentiated cells abrogated apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death. The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy."

The total number of amino acids encoded (the proteome) is more than double that in yeast and rivals that of metazoans. The genome sequence shows all the proteins available to Dictyostelium as well as definitively showing which domains have been lost since Dictyostelium diverged from the line leading to metazoans. Genomics opens the door to determining the expression patterns of all the genes during growth and development using microarrays. This approach has already uncovered a wealth of new markers for the stages of development and the various cell types. Transcription factors and their cis-regulatory sites that account for the surprising complexity of Dictyostelium development can be analyzed much more easily now that we have the complete sequence."

Herein, we developed a facile approach in which the sphingolipids of cellular extracts were dramatically enriched by direct alkaline methanolysis of lipid extracts followed by extraction to remove the large majority of other endogenous lipid classes. Through direct infusion of the resultant enriched solution, we identified and quantitated a variety of very-low-abundance sphingolipid classes (e.g., sphingosine, psychosine, and lysosphingomyelin) and molecular species (e.g., sphingomyelin) using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (i.e., shotgun sphingolipidomics). Accordingly, through utilization of these facile enrichment techniques, direct penetrance into the sphingolipidomes has been greatly extended, facilitating new insights into their metabolism and signaling functions in biological systems."

Here we applied an untargeted metabolomics approach to a sterile and self-resolving animal model of acute inflammation, namely zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice, to examine the effect of inflammation and resolution on the metabolomic profiles. Significant and time-dependent changes in metabolite profiles after zymosan administration were observed in both peritoneal wash fluid (PWF) and plasma. These metabolomic changes correlated well with inflammatory chemokine or cytokine production. In PWF, most of metabolites that could detected increased in zymosan-treated mice, which is suggestive of inflammation, oxidative stress and increased energy demands. In plasma, most metabolites in the central metabolic pathway (glycolysis and TCA cycle) were significantly downregulated after zymosan administration. The concentration of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB) in plasma and PWF increased in zymosan-injected animals indicating upregulation of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Increased 3-HB level was observed in the cells that infiltrated into the peritoneal cavity and these infiltrated cells might contribute, at least in part, to the production of 3-HB in the peritoneal cavity."

Glypicans can be released from the cell surface by a lipase called Notum, and most of them are subjected to endoproteolytic cleavage by furin-like convertases. In vivo evidence published so far indicates that the main function of membrane-attached glypicans is to regulate the signaling of Wnts, Hedgehogs, fibroblast growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Depending on the context, glypicans may have a stimulatory or inhibitory activity on signaling. In the case of Wnt, it has been proposed that the stimulatory mechanism is based on the ability of glypicans to facilitate and/or stabilize the interaction of Wnts with their signaling receptors, the Frizzled proteins. On the other hand, GPC3 has recently been reported to inhibit Hedgehog protein signaling during development by competing with Patched, the Hedgehog receptor, for Hedgehog binding. Surprisingly, the regulatory activity of glypicans in the Wnt, Hedgehog and BMP signaling pathways is only partially dependent on the heparan sulfate chains."

Supplemental hormonal therapies carry the burden of a risk/benefit ratio that must be highly individualized. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are estrogen receptor (ER) agonist/antagonists designed to induce benefits comparable with estrogen while minimizing adverse effects. Here, we review the estrogen agonist/antagonist profile of ospemifene, a novel triphenylethylene derivative recently approved to treat dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause, both preclinically and clinically. Ospemifene binds ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 with approximately equal affinities. In preclinical models, ospemifene increased vaginal and uterine epithelial thickness and mucification to the same extent as estrogen. Ospemifene did not induce endometrial hyperplasia in animal models; there also was no stimulatory effect on endometrial cells. In rat and human mammary cells in vitro, ospemifene evokes a dose-dependent inhibition on estrogen-induced cell responses and cell proliferation, supporting an antiestrogenic effect in breast. In contrast, ospemifene has an estrogenic effect on bone, as seen by improved bone mineral density, strength, mass, and histomorphometry in preclinical models, consistent with improvements in markers of bone resorption and formation in postmenopausal women. Based on the preclinical evidence, ospemifene has beneficial estrogen-like effects on the vaginal epithelium, preliminary evidence to support a neutral endometrial profile, antiproliferative effects in breast, and estrogenic effects in bone. Taken together, especially regarding estrogen-like effects on the vaginal epithelium, ospemifene presents a profile of tissue-specific effects that appear novel among available SERMs and well-suited for the treatment of VVA.

Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1 year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence). Pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine have been established as effective for up to 6 months in treating RLS/WED (Level A). The following drugs have been established as probably effective (Level B) in treating RLS/WED for durations ranging from 1 to 5 years: gabapentin enacarbil, pramipexole, and ropinirole (1 year); levodopa (2 years); and rotigotine (5 years). Because of associated safety concerns, pergolide and cabergoline should not be used in the treatment of RLS/WED unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Other pharmacologic therapies have insufficient evidence to support their long-term use in treating RLS/WED. The IRLSSG Task Force also developed consensus-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of complications (such as augmentation, loss of efficacy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and impulse control disorders) that may develop with the long-term pharmacologic treatment of RLS/WED. The use of either a dopamine-receptor agonist or \u03b12\u03b4 calcium-channel ligand is recommended as the first-line treatment of RLS/WED for most patients, with the choice of agent dependent on the patient's severity of RLS/WED symptoms, cognitive status, history, and comorbid conditions."

Since over-expression of APP, or a subdomain of it, might lead to an immediately lethal effect, we used the Cre-LoxP System to regulate APP expression. Our genetically transformed cell lines, w5c1 and s12c8, showed detectable APP and Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) production. The Swedish double mutation in the APP coding sequence enhanced APP and A\u03b2 abundance. What is more, the activity of the three key secretases in A\u03b2 formation could be modulated, indicating that these transgenic cells have potential for drug screening to modify amyloid metabolism in cells. Our transformed cells could readily be propagated in culture and should provide an excellent experimental medium for elucidating aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, especially those concerning the amyloidogenic pathways involving mutations in the APP coding sequence. The cellular models may also serve as a tool for deriving potentially useful therapeutic agents. "

Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The fitness of hfq mutations in Escherichia coli affecting the RNA chaperone involved in small-RNA regulation is remarkably sensitive to growth rate. E. coli populations evolving in chemostats under nutrient limitation acquired beneficial mutations in hfq during slow growth (0.1\u2009h(-1)) but not in populations growing sixfold faster. Four identified hfq alleles from parallel populations were beneficial at 0.1\u2009h(-1) and deleterious at 0.6\u2009h(-1). The hfq mutations were beneficial, deleterious or neutral at an intermediate growth rate (0.5\u2009h(-1)) and one changed from beneficial to deleterious within a 36\u2009min difference in doubling time. The benefit of hfq mutations was due to the greater transport of limiting nutrient, which diminished at higher growth rates. The deleterious effects of hfq mutations at 0.6\u2009h(-1) were less clear, with decreased viability a contributing factor. The results demonstrate distinct pleiotropy characteristics in the alleles of the same gene, probably because the altered residues in Hfq affected the regulation of expression of different genes in distinct ways. In addition, these results point to a source of variation in experimental measurement of the selective advantage of a mutation; estimates of fitness need to consider variation in growth rate impacting on the magnitude of the benefit of mutations and on their fitness distributions."

Metnase promotes progression through decatenation and increases resistance to the Topo IIalpha inhibitors ICRF-193 and VP-16. Purified Metnase greatly enhanced Topo IIalpha decatenation of kinetoplast DNA to relaxed circular forms. Nuclear extracts containing Metnase decatenated kDNA more rapidly than those without Metnase, and neutralizing anti-sera against Metnase reversed that enhancement of decatenation. Metnase automethylates at K485, and the presence of a methyl donor blocked the enhancement of Topo IIalpha decatenation by Metnase, implying an internal regulatory inhibition. Thus, Metnase enhances Topo IIalpha decatenation, and this activity is repressed by automethylation. These results suggest that cancer cells could subvert Metnase to mediate clinically relevant resistance to Topo IIalpha inhibitors."

Phosphomimetic CTD mutants not only display lower elongation but also duplicate the UV effect on AS. Consistently, nonphosphorylatable mutants prevent the UV effect. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. Splicing-sensitive microarrays revealed a significant overlap of the subsets of genes that have changed AS with UV and those that have reduced expression, suggesting that transcriptional coupling to AS is a key feature of the DNA-damage response."

From a quantitative perspective, DHB is usually a poor matrix due to its poor shot-to-shot and poor spot-to-spot reproducibilities. We found that the quantitative precisions improved significantly when DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) was added to the matrix solution. For lopinavir and ritonavir, currently the most frequently prescribed HIV-1 protease inhibitors, the signal-to-noise ratios improved significantly when potassium iodide was added to the matrix solution. The mean quantitative precisions, expressed as % relative standard deviation, were 6.4% for saquinavir, 7.3% for lopinavir, 8.5% for ritonavir, 11.1% for indinavir, and 7.2% for nelfinavir. The mean quantitative accuracies, expressed as % deviation, were 4.5% for saquinavir, 6.0% for lopinavir, 5.9% for ritonavir, 6.6% for indinavir, and 8.0% for nelfinavir. The concentrations measured for the individual quality control samples were all within 85-117% of the theoretical concentrations. The lower limits of quantification in cell lysates were 4 fmol/microL for saquinavir, 16 fmol/microL for lopinavir, 31 fmol/microL for ritonavir, and 100 fmol/microL for indinavir and nelfinavir. The mean mass accuracies for the protease inhibitors were 0.28 ppm using external calibration. Our results show that MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometry can be successfully used for precise, accurate, and selective quantitative analyses of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in cell lysates. In addition, the lower limits of quantification obtained allow clinical applications of the technique."

We show that, unlike steady-state occupancy, DNA site exposure kinetics near a barrier is dominated by DNA sequence rather than by proximity to the barrier itself. The timescale for formation of positioning patterns near barriers is proportional to the timescale for active nucleosome eviction. We also show that there are strong gene-to-gene variations in nucleosome positioning near barriers, which are eliminated by averaging over many genes. Our results suggest that measurement of nucleosome kinetics can reveal information about sequence-dependent regulation that is not apparent in steady-state nucleosome occupancy. "

In a large-scale screening for miRNAs potentially involved in bleomycin-induced fibrosis, we found expression of miR-29 family members significantly reduced in fibrotic lungs. Analysis of normal lungs showed the presence of miR-29 in subsets of interstitial cells of the alveolar wall, pleura, and at the entrance of the alveolar duct, known sites of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-29 levels inversely correlated with the expression levels of profibrotic target genes and the severity of the fibrosis. To study the impact of miR-29 down-regulation in the lung interstitium, we characterized gene expression profiles of human fetal lung fibroblast IMR-90 cells in which endogenous miR-29 was knocked down. This confirmed the derepression of reported miR-29 targets, including several collagens, but also revealed up-regulation of a large number of previously unrecognized extracellular matrix-associated and remodeling genes. Moreover, we found that miR-29 is suppressed by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 in these cells, and that many fibrosis-associated genes up-regulated by TGF-\u03b21 are derepressed by miR-29 knockdown. Interestingly, a comparison of TGF-\u03b21 and miR-29 targets revealed that miR-29 controls an additional subset of fibrosis-related genes, including laminins and integrins, independent of TGF-\u03b21. Together, these strongly suggest a role of miR-29 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-29 may be a potential new therapeutic target for this disease."

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis indicated that TRN moves rapidly in and out of cytoplasmic granules. Depletion of TRN greatly enhanced P-body formation but did not affect the number or size of SGs, suggesting that TRN or its cargo(es) participates in cellular function of P-bodies.

Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1.

Sorafenib inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. These effects were neither correlated with modulation of MAPK and AKT pathways nor dependent on the ER\u03b1 status. Sorafenib promoted an early perturbation of mitochondrial function, inducing a deep depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, associated with drop of intracellular ATP levels and increase of ROS generation. As a response to this stress condition, the energy sensor AMPK was rapidly activated in all the cell lines analyzed. In MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells, AMPK enhanced glucose uptake by up-regulating the expression of GLUT-1 glucose transporter, as also demonstrated by AMPK\u03b11 RNA interference, and stimulated aerobic glycolysis thus increasing lactate production. Moreover, the GLUT-1 inhibitor fasentin blocked sorafenib-induced glucose uptake and potentiated its cytotoxic activity in SKBR3 cells. Persistent activation of AMPK by sorafenib finally led to the impairment of glucose metabolism both in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells as well as in the highly glycolytic MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in cell death. This previously unrecognized long-term effect of sorafenib was mediated by AMPK-dependent inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway. Suppression of mTORC1 activity was sufficient for sorafenib to hinder glucose utilization in breast cancer cells, as demonstrated by the observation that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin induced a comparable down-regulation of GLUT-1 expression and glucose uptake. The key role of AMPK-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 in sorafenib mechanisms of action was confirmed by AMPK\u03b11 silencing, which restored mTORC1 activity conferring a significant protection from cell death. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving sorafenib anti-tumoral activity in breast cancer, and supports the need for going on with clinical trials aimed at proving the efficacy of sorafenib for breast cancer treatment."

Recent studies have discovered thousands of endogenous circRNAs in mammalian cells. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. The majority of circRNAs are conserved across species, are stable and resistant to RNase R, and often exhibit tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases. Similar to miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs are becoming a new research hotspot in the field of RNA and could be widely involved in the processes of life. Herein, we review the formation and properties of circRNAs, their functions, and their potential significance in disease. "

That scaling is a very particular case of Menzerath-Altmann law that has been rejected by means of a correlation test between X and Y in genomes, being X the number of chromosomes of a species, Y its genome size in bases and Z the mean chromosome size. Here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if Z \u223c 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric one based upon the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z \u223c 1/X in nine out of 11 taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group. Rather than a fact, Z \u223c 1/X is a baseline that real genomes do not meet. The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as inevitable is seriously flawed."

Nonsense and most splicing mutations result in the synthesis of truncated peptides, and it has been assumed that truncated PSEN1 protein is functionless so that heterozygotes for these mutations are unaffected. Some FAD mutations affecting PSEN1 mRNA splicing cause loss of exon 8 or 9 sequences while maintaining the reading frame. We attempted to model these exon-loss mutations in zebrafish embryos by injecting morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (morpholinos) directed against splice acceptor sites in zebrafish psen1 transcripts. However, this produced cryptic changes in splicing potentially forming mRNAs encoding truncated presenilin proteins. Aberrant splicing in the region between exons 6 and 8 produces potent dominant negative effects on Psen1 protein activity, including Notch signalling, and causes a hydrocephalus phenotype. Reductions in Psen1 activity feedback positively to increase psen1 transcription through a mechanism apparently independent of gamma-secretase. We present evidence that the dominant negative effects are mediated through production of truncated Psen1 peptides that interfere with the normal activity of both Psen1 and Psen2. Mutations causing such truncations would be dominant lethal in embryo development. Somatic cellular changes in ageing cells that interfere with PSEN1 splicing, or otherwise cause protein truncation, might contribute to sporadic Alzheimer's disease, cancer and other diseases."

In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. However, its contribution to the restoration of transcription and to global repair of oxidative damage has not been examined. Here, we report the first direct study of transcriptional recovery following UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage in E. coli. We observed that mutations in mfd or uvrA reduced the rate that transcription recovered following UV-induced damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage. mfd mutants were also fully resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and removed oxidative lesions from the genome at rates comparable to wild-type cells. The results demonstrate that Mfd promotes the rapid recovery of gene expression following UV-induced damage in E. coli. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage."

Though regulation of other genes involved in copper homeostasis is well understood, the regulation of gene encoding low-affinity copper transporter Ctr2p, which mediates mobilization of vacuolar or lysosomal stored copper ions, is still unclear. In this study, we found that copper depletion can upregulate yeast CTR2 gene transcription while copper overload downregulate it. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. Though absent of consensus Mac1p binding sequences, CTR2 promoter region is demonstrated to be occupied by Mac1p, according to our results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Overexpression of Mac1p can upregulate CTR2 transcription and partially complement the growth defect of copper-deficient yeast strain. Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation."

In heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory patients alemtuzumab induced responses in more than two thirds of T-PLL and more than 50% of CTCL patients. Responding patients had improved survival compared to nonresponders. Alemtuzumab is particularly effective in clearing malignant lymphocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow and may therefore facilitate stem-cell transplantation (SCT) in selected patients. The toxicity profile for the antibody is acceptable; the major complications are infusional reactions, which generally subside after the first 1-2 weeks of therapy, and prolonged lymphopenia associated with reactivation of viruses. These can be minimized by careful monitoring and the use of prophylactic therapy. Future studies will be directed toward: alternative routes (subcutaneous) and schedules of administration; use as first-line therapy; combination strategies with conventional chemotherapy; and use of alemtuzumab to purge minimal residual bone-marrow disease prior to SCT."

Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting. By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified. At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis. The diagnosis of dystrophin defect-related dilated cardiomyopathy is important for patients and families, especially for carrier detection. These patients present X-linked inheritance, dominant cardiac involvement and raised levels of serum creatine phosphokinase. Defects of the glycoprotein complex associated to dystrophin (DAG) are rare skeletal muscle diseases with possible cardiac involvement. Mitochondrial diseases, both pure cardiomyopathies and multiorgan syndromes involving the heart, are associated to defects of mitochondrial DNA genes or of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins. Barth's syndrome develops in male children with granulocytopenia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and methylglutaconic aciduria. Cardiomyopathies with atrioventricular block are observed in hemochromatosis, Emery-Dreifuss syndrome, desmin storage disease, and in isolated familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Actin defects were recently identified in 2 unrelated patients with familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. The overall knowledge, although in progression, is still limited. Clinical family screening identifies familial forms, preclinical cases, and inheritance pattern. By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects."

The data show that cytokine and neuropeptide mRNA components are abnormal and differentially modulated in brain regions. IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were up-regulated in all brain regions following BDV inoculation. The same cerebellar samples from BDV-infected animals exhibited the highest levels of IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, TNF-alpha, IL-1RI, and IL-1R AcP II mRNA expression. The profiles of IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta1 mRNA induction in the cerebellar samples were highly intercorrelated, indicating an association among cytokine ligand mRNAs. Cytokine mRNA induction was differentially up-regulated among brain regions, except for TGF-beta1. Specificity of transcriptional changes in response to BDV infection is also suggested by the up-regulation of cytokine and neuropeptide Y mRNAs associated with down-regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin, and with no change of IL-1R AcPI, dynorphin and leptin receptor mRNAs in the same brain region samples. Other data also show a differential mRNA component modulation in distinct brain regions obtained from the same rats depending on the stage of BDV infection. The conclusion of these studies is that cytokines may play a role in the neuropathophysiology of neonatally BDV-infected rats."

Targeted disruption of an upstream regulatory element (URE) located several kb upstream in the PU.1 promoter decreases PU.1 expression thereby inducing AML in mice. In addition, suppression of PU.1 has been observed in specific subtypes of human AML. Here, we identified nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to activate PU.1 expression through a novel site within the URE. We found sequence variations of this particular NF-kappaB site in 4 of 120 AML patients. These variant NF-kappaB sequences failed to mediate activation of PU.1. Moreover, the synergistic activation of PU.1 together with CEBPB through these variant sequences was also lost. Finally, AML patients with such variant sequences had suppressed PU.1 mRNA expression. This study suggests that changes of a single base pair in a distal element critically affect the regulation of the tumor suppressor gene PU.1 thereby contributing to the development of AML."

This is indeed the case for all bacterial and eukaryotic genomes studied, although the genomic patterns may differ among genomes in terms of local deviations. The behaviour of organellar genomes regarding the second parity rule has not been studied in detail up to now. We tested all available organellar genomes and found that a large number of mitochondrial genomes significantly deviate from the 2nd parity rule in contrast to the eubacterial ones, although mitochondria are believed to have evolved from proteobacteria. Moreover, mitochondria may be divided into three distinct sub-groups according to their overall deviation from the aforementioned parity rule. On the other hand, chloroplast genomes share the pattern of eubacterial genomes and, interestingly, so do mitochondrial genomes originating from plants and some fungi. The deviation from the second parity is found to be weakly correlated with the overall excess of purines against pyrimidines. The behaviour of the large majority of the mitochondrial genomes may be attributed to their distinct mode of replication, which is fundamentally different from the one of the eubacteria. Differences between chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes might also be explained on the basis of different replication mechanisms and correlated to differences in the genome size and compaction. The results presented herein may provide some insight into different modes of evolution of genome structure between chloroplasts and mitochondria."

Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares many chromatin features with spermatogenesis, including a 10-fold compaction of the nucleus. To identify new proteins involved in spore nuclear organization, we purified chromatin from mature spores and discovered a significant enrichment of the linker histone (Hho1). The function of Hho1 has proven to be elusive during vegetative growth, but here we demonstrate its requirement for efficient sporulation and full compaction of the spore genome. Hho1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed increased genome-wide binding in mature spores and provides novel in vivo evidence of the linker histone binding to nucleosomal linker DNA. We also link Hho1 function to the transcription factor Ume6, the master repressor of early meiotic genes. Hho1 and Ume6 are depleted during meiosis, and analysis of published ChIP-chip data obtained during vegetative growth reveals a high binding correlation of both proteins at promoters of early meiotic genes. Moreover, Ume6 promotes binding of Hho1 to meiotic gene promoters. Thus, Hho1 may play a dual role during sporulation: Hho1 and Ume6 depletion facilitates the onset of meiosis via activation of Ume6-repressed early meiotic genes, whereas Hho1 enrichment in mature spores contributes to spore genome compaction."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic role of survivin and livin mRNA expression in the bronchial aspirates of patients with lung cancer. Seventy lung cancer patients and 26 benign lung disease patients participated in our study. The bronchial aspirates (bronchial wash or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids) obtained during bronchoscopy. Survivin and livin mRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze diagnostic performance of the two markers. Survivin and livin mRNA levels in patients with lung cancer were significantly higher than in those with benign lung disease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In lung cancer patients, specimens taken from cancerous bronchi had significantly higher levels of survivin and livin mRNA than specimens from the mirror side bronchi in the same patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). The best cutoff values of survivin and livin were selected according to ROC curves. The survivin mRNA expression in bronchial aspirates had sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 96% for diagnosis of lung cancer. Livin mRNA detection in bronchial aspirates showed 63% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Our findings suggest that survivin and livin mRNA detection in bronchial aspirates may be valuable diagnostic marker for the early diagnosis of lung cancer."

To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 (Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice) using a conditional approach. Deletion of exon 9 would cause a carboxyl-terminal truncation of CYLD and inactivation of its deubiquitinating activity. In accordance with previous studies, fibroblasts from Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) embryos had hyperactive nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun kinase pathways compared with control fibroblasts. Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) newborn mice were smaller than wild-type littermates with a short and kinky tail and no major developmental defects. However, Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice died shortly after birth from apparent respiratory dysfunction. Histological examination of E18.5 Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) lungs demonstrated an immature phenotype characterized by hyperplasic mesenchyme but apparently normal epithelial, smooth muscle. and endothelial structures.

The correlation between the genomic signature and DNA-DNA hybridisation values was high and taxa that showed less than 30% DNA-DNA binding will in general not have dinucleotide relative abundance dissimilarity (delta*) values below 40.

Histone H2B ubiquitination and deubiquitination have been implicated in transcriptional regulation, but the function of H2B deubiquitination is not well defined, particularly in higher eukaryotes. Here we report the purification of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 49 (USP49) as a histone H2B-specific deubiquitinase and demonstrate that H2B deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. USP49 forms a complex with RuvB-like1 (RVB1) and SUG1 and specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B in vitro and in vivo. USP49 knockdown results in small changes in gene expression but affects the abundance of >9000 isoforms. Exons down-regulated in USP49 knockdown cells show both elevated levels of alternative splicing and a general decrease in splicing efficiency. Importantly, USP49 is relatively enriched at this set of exons. USP49 knockdown increased H2B ubiquitination (uH2B) levels at these exons as well as upstream 3' and downstream 5' intronic splicing elements. Change in H2B ubiquitination level, as modulated by USP49, regulates U1A and U2B association with chromatin and binding to nascent pre-mRNA. Although H3 levels are relatively stable after USP49 depletion, H2B levels at these exons are dramatically increased, suggesting that uH2B may enhance nucleosome stability. Therefore, this study identifies USP49 as a histone H2B-specific deubiquitinase and uncovers a critical role for H2B deubiquitination in cotranscriptional pre-mRNA processing events. "

We found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal CaMKII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified recombinant DmUba2/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S) mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120 species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt) protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates. High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype with retinal degeneration. These results suggest that normal SUMO conjugation is essential in the differentiated nervous system and reveal a potential novel mechanism that regulates neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function."

We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. GARS is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases responsible for charging tRNA with cognate amino acids; GARS ligates glycine to tRNA(Gly). Here, we present functional analyses of disease-associated GARS mutations and show that there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in GARS expression levels; that the majority of identified GARS mutations modeled in yeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant GARS protein mislocalizes in neuronal cells. Indeed, four of the five mutations studied show loss-of-function features in at least one assay, suggesting that tRNA-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis. Finally, we detected endogenous GARS-associated granules in the neurite projections of cultured neurons and in the peripheral nerve axons of normal human tissue. These data are particularly important in light of the recent identification of CMT-associated mutations in another tRNA synthetase gene [YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene)]. Together, these findings suggest that tRNA-charging enzymes play a key role in maintaining peripheral axons."

Carbonylation profiles of RBC membrane proteins revealed that group O blood shows a reduced protein oxidation pattern compared to groups A, B and AB. Upon infection with Plasmodium falciparum Dd2, erythrocytes of all blood groups showed increased oxidation of membrane proteins. By examining 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) we observed that, upon malaria infection, the protein components of lipid rafts and cytoskeleton were the main targets of 4-HNE carbonylation in all blood groups. Ankyrins and protein bands 4.2 and 4.1 were differentially carbonylated in group O as compared to A and B groups. During trophozoite maturation in group O erythrocytes, a steady increase was observed in the number of 4-HNE-modified proteins, suggesting a parasite-driven 4-HNE-carbonylation process. Our findings indicate a possible correlation between the protection against severe malaria in blood group O individuals and a specific pattern of 4-HNE-carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins."

To test the consequences of subtle structural alterations remote from the RdRp active-site, the following single point mutations were engineered in the WNV NS5 RdRp coding region: T363N, A365N, and T537I; these mutations were selected in an effort to stabilize the secondary structural elements near the rNTP binding pocket of the RdRp. Mutant viruses were tested in vitro on Vero, C6/36, Culex tarsalis and DF-1 cell types and in vivo in one day old chickens and Culex pipiens mosquitoes.

The drug causes selective inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonine and norepinephrine with little effect on other neurotransmitter systems. Cases of seizures, tachycardia, and QRS prolongation have been observed following drug overdose in humans. The clinical manifestations of cardiac toxicity suggest that venlafaxine may exhibit cardiac electrophysiological effects on fast conducting cells. Consequently, studies were undertaken to characterize effects of venlafaxine on the fast inward sodium current (I(Na)) of isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Currents were recorded with the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique in the presence of Ca(2+) and K(+) channel blockers. Results obtained demonstrated that venlafaxine inhibits peak I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner with an estimated IC(50) of 8. 10(-6) M. Inhibition was exclusively of a tonic nature and rate-independent. Neither kinetics of inactivation (tau(inac)= 0.652 +/- 0.020 ms, under control conditions; tau(inac)= 0.636 +/- 0.050, in the presence of 10(-5) M venlafaxine; n = 5 cells isolated from five animals) nor kinetics of recovery from inactivation of the sodium channels (tau(re)= 58.7 +/- 1.6 ms, under control conditions; tau(re)= 54.4 +/- 1.8, in the presence of 10(-5) M venlafaxine; n = 10 cells isolated from six animals) were significantly altered by 10(-5) M venlafaxine. These observations led us to conclude that venlafaxine blocks I(Na) following its binding to the resting state of the channel. Thus, the characteristics of block of I(Na) by venlafaxine are different from those usually observed with most tricyclic antidepressants or conventional class I antiarrhythmic drugs."

The determination of anti-CCP2 was performed using enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kits and IgM-RF by latex agglutination test. Clinical and demographical data were obtained through review of charts. Anti-CCP positivity intensity was directly correlated with tobacco smoking, sex, and the development of rheumatoid nodules. Intense anti-CCP2 reaction was 19.8-fold higher in females vs. males, 2.7-fold higher in tobacco vs. non-tobacco users, 7.7-fold higher in female vs. male tobacco users, and 5.15-fold higher in patients with rheumatoid nodules. Tobacco smoking, gender, and rheumatoid nodules are significantly correlated with anti-CCP2 positivity in Brazilian RA patients."

We encountered a pregnant patient with hyperemesis and thyrotoxicosis, who manifested symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. Although her serum hCG concentration transiently increased in accordance with the thyrotoxicosis, it was within normal limits for the gestational week. Both the thyrotoxicosis and a catabolic state due to the hyperemesis were thought to have induced a vitamin B1 deficiency, causing the Wernicke encephalopathy.

The language of epigenetic program is based on specific covalent modifications of DNA and chromatin. Thus, in addition to the individual identity, encoded by sequence of the four bases of the DNA, there is a cell type identity characterized by its positioning in the epigenetic \"landscape\". Aberrant changes in epigenetic marks induced by environmental cues may contribute to the development of abnormal phenotypes associated with different human diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders and inflammation. Most of the epigenetic studies have focused on embryonic development and cancer biology, while little has been done to explore the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function."

To determine the RNA was confined inside exosomes, the pellet was treated with RNase before RNA isolation. The minimum urine volume, storage conditions for exosomes and exosomal miRNA was evaluated. The presence of miRNAs in patients with various kidney diseases was validated with real-time PCR. The result shows that miRNAs extracted from the exosomal fraction were resistant to RNase digestion and with high quality confirmed by agarose electrophoresis. 16 ml of urine was sufficient for miRNA isolation by absolute quantification with 4.15\u00d710(5) copies/ul for miR-200c. Exosomes was stable at 4\u2103 24h for shipping before stored at -80\u2103 and was stable in urine when stored at -80\u00b0C for 12 months. Exosomal miRNA was detectable despite 5 repeat freeze-thaw cycles. The detection of miRNA by quantitative PCR showed high reproducibility (>94% for intra-assay and >76% for inter-assay), high sensitivity (positive call 100% for CKD patients), broad dynamic range (8-log wide) and good linearity for quantification (R(2)>0.99). miR-29c and miR-200c showed different expression in different types of kidney disease. In summary, the presence of urinary exosomal miRNA was confirmed for patients with a diversity of chronic kidney disease.

This study tried to explore the hepatic Nrf2 pathway upon arsenic treatment comprehensively, since liver is one of the major target organs of arsenical toxicity. Our results showed that inorganic arsenic significantly induced Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression in Chang human hepatocytes. We also observed a dose-dependent increase of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) luciferase activity. Both the mRNA and protein levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were all upregulated dramatically. On the other hand, entry and accumulation of Nrf2 protein in the nucleus, while exportting the transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, were also confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Our results therefore confirmed the arsenic-induced Nrf2 pathway activation in hepatocytes and also suggested that the translocation of Bach1 was associated with the regulation of Nrf2 pathway by arsenic. Hepatic Nrf2 pathway plays indispensable roles for cellular defenses against arsenic hepatotoxicity, and the interplay of Bach1 and Nrf2 may be helpful to understand the self-defensive responses and the diverse biological effects of arsenicals."

Although the maximum standardized uptake values were slightly higher in patients with SPNs due to MAC (median = 8.5) compared with those with tuberculomas (median = 2.2), this difference was not significant (P = 0.053).

A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. The divergence of CNEs seems to have been initiated in basal ray-finned fishes before the WGD.

At an early stage of 4 h after ischemia, gene induction occurred to a similar extent in the ischemic infarct and remote non-ischemic cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Among the genes induced in non-ischemic cortex we found the NGF-inducible genes PC3, VGF and Arc, the transcriptional regulators I kappa B-alpha and Stat3, and the beta-chemokine MIP-1 alpha (CCL3). At 3 days, the spatial pattern of gene expression had changed dramatically with brain fatty acid-binding protein as the only gene significantly induced in non-ischemic ipsilateral cortex. In contrast, numerous genes were exclusively regulated at the lesion site, comprising genes involved in cell cycle regulation, proteolysis, apoptosis, lipid homeostasis and anti-inflammatory counter-regulation. Cortical spreading depression was identified as the main mechanism underlying gene induction in remote non-ischemic cortex. Our data demonstrate a dynamic spatiotemporal pattern of gene induction, which may contribute to delayed progression of damage or, alternatively, mediate neuroprotection, tissue remodeling and functional compensation."

This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocite lumen, regulating cardiac contractility. PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA. Here, we show that the single phosphoryl transfer at Ser16 induces a more pronounced conformational switch to the R state in phosphorylated PLN (pPLN). The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected (K(d) values for the transmembrane domains of pPLN and PLN are approximately 60 microM), supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser16 does not dissociate PLN from SERCA. However, the binding surface and dynamics in domain Ib (residues 22-31) change substantially upon phosphorylation. Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, we propose that these sites remotely control the conformation of domain Ib. These findings constitute a paradigm for how post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic portion of membrane proteins control intramembrane protein-protein interactions."

Here, we investigated the biological and therapeutic importance of the activated BRAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in HCL by exposing in vitro primary leukemic cells purified from 26 patients to clinically available BRAF (vemurafenib; dabrafenib) or MEK (trametinib) inhibitors. Results were validated in vivo in samples from vemurafenib-treated HCL patients within a phase 2 clinical trial. BRAF and MEK inhibitors caused, specifically in HCL (but not HCL-like) cells, marked MEK/ERK dephosphorylation, silencing of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway transcriptional output, loss of the HCL-specific gene expression signature, downregulation of the HCL markers CD25, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cyclin D1, smoothening of leukemic cells' hairy surface, and, eventually, apoptosis. Apoptosis was partially blunted by coculture with bone marrow stromal cells antagonizing MEK-ERK dephosphorylation. This protective effect could be counteracted by combined BRAF and MEK inhibition. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL. "

The aim of this study is to evaluate the status of TERT promoter and the respective prognostic significance in a cohort of 237 lower-grade gliomas comprising grades II and III astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Mutually exclusive mutations in TERT promoter, C228T and C250T, were identified in 16/105 (15%) diffuse astrocytomas, 16/63 (25%) anaplastic astrocytomas, 13/18 (72%) oligodendrogliomas, 3/3 (100%) anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 17/45 (38%) oligoastrocytomas, and 2/3 (67%) anaplastic oligoastrocytomas. Mutations co-occurred with 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) and are associated with oligodendroglial histology (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed that TERT promoter mutation (P=0.037), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (P<0.001), and 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas.

P., Hamid, J., Doering, C., Jarvis, S. E., Bosey, G. M., Bourinet, E., Snutch, T. P., and Zamponi, G. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5726-5730). Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels. We find that in addition to previously identified amino acid residues, residues in positions 1326 and 1332 are important determinants of omega-conotoxin GVIA blockade. Substitution of residue Glu(1332) to arginine slows the time course of development of block. Point mutations in position Gly(1326) to either arginine, glutamic acid, or proline dramatically decrease the time constant for development of the block. Additionally, in the G1326P mutant channel activity was almost completely recovered following washout. A qualitatively similar result was obtained with omega-conotoxin MVIIA, suggesting that common molecular determinants underlie block by these two toxins. Taken together the data suggest that residue Gly(1326) may form a barrier, which controls the access of peptide toxins to their blocking site within the outer vestibule of the channel pore and also stabilizes the toxin-channel interaction."

Simultaneously, Rab35 supresses the activity of the GTPase Arf6 to downregulate an Arf6-dependent recycling pathway for \u03b21-integrin and EGF receptors, resulting in inhibition of cell migration and attenuation of signaling downstream of these receptors. Importantly, the phenotypes of decreased cell adhesion and increased cell migration observed following Rab35 knock down are consistent with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a feature of invasive cancer cells, and we show that Rab35 expression is suppressed in a subset of cancers characterized by Arf6 hyperactivity.

Here, we report 3 families with BBS and HSCR with concomitant mutations in BBS genes and regulatory RET elements, whose functionality is tested in physiologically relevant assays. Our data suggest that BBS mutations can potentiate HSCR predisposing RET alleles, which by themselves are insufficient to cause disease. We also demonstrate that these genes interact genetically in vivo to modulate gut innervation, and that this interaction likely occurs through complementary, yet independent, pathways that converge on the same biological process."

Under pathological, demyelinating conditions within the central nervous system (CNS), axonal remyelination is only partially successful because oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) largely remain in an undifferentiated state resulting in a failure to generate myelinating OLGs. Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme, which amongst other functions, is involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TG2 contributes to differentiation of OPCs into OLGs and thereby stimulates remyelination. In vivo studies, using the cuprizone model for de- and remyelination in TG2(-/-) and wild-type mice, showed that during remyelination expression of proteolipid protein mRNA, as a marker for remyelination, in the corpus callosum lags behind in TG2(-/-) mice resulting in less myelin formation and, moreover, impaired recovery of motor behavior. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that rat OPCs express TG2 protein and activity which reduces when the cells have matured into OLGs. Furthermore, when TG2 activity is pharmacologically inhibited, the differentiation of OPCs into myelin-forming OLGs is dramatically reduced. We conclude that TG2 plays a prominent role in remyelination of the CNS, probably through stimulating OPC differentiation into myelin-forming OLGs. Therefore, manipulating TG2 activity may represent an interesting new target for remyelination in demyelinating diseases."

The relative ease with which genes can be knocked out, and exogenous sequences introduced, has allowed the mouse to become the prime model for deciphering the genetic code. Not surprisingly, the lack of authentic ESCs has hampered the livestock genetics field and has forced animal scientists into adapting alternative technologies for genetic engineering. The recent discovery of the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by upregulation of a handful of reprogramming genes has offered renewed enthusiasm to animal geneticists. However, much like ESCs, establishing authentic iPSCs from the domestic animals is still beset with problems, including (but not limited to) the persistent expression of reprogramming genes and the lack of proven potential for differentiation into target cell types both in vitro and in vivo. Site-specific nucleases comprised of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulated interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) emerged as powerful genetic tools for precisely editing the genome, usurping the need for ESC-based genetic modifications even in the mouse. In this article, in the aftermath of these powerful genome editing technologies, the role of pluripotent stem cells in livestock genetics is discussed. "

Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes were observed most frequently, with single short-burst episodes the second most frequent. The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.

In this study we sought to further investigate the role of the complex mixture of ECM on this response and assess the potential mechanism behind it. Using traction force microscopy, we measured cellular traction forces and stresses for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) grown on polyacrylamide gels at a range of stiffnesses (9, 25, or 48 kPa) containing either adult rat heart ECM, different singular ECM proteins including collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin, or ECM mimics comprised of varying amounts of collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin. We also measured the expression of integrins on these different substrates as well as probed for \u03b21 integrin binding. There was no significant change in traction force generation for cells grown on the adult ECM, as previously reported, whereas cells grown on singular ECM protein substrates had increased traction force generation with an increase in substrate stiffness. Cells grown on ECM mimics containing collagen I, fibronectin and laminin were found to be reminiscent of the traction forces generated by cells grown on native ECM. Integrin expression generally increased with increasing stiffness except for the \u03b21 integrin, potentially implicating it as playing a role in the response to adult cardiac ECM. We inhibited binding through the \u03b21 integrin on cells grown on the adult ECM and found that the inhibition of \u03b21 binding led to a return to the typical response of increasing traction force generation with increasing stiffness. Our data demonstrates that cells grown on the mature cardiac ECM are able to circumvent typical stiffness related cellular behaviors, likely through \u03b21 integrin binding to the complex composition."

Ca(2+) is a conventional diffusible second messenger released inside cells by the interaction of first messengers with plasma membrane receptors. However, it can also penetrate directly into cells to deliver information without the intermediation of first or second messengers. Even more distinctively, Ca(2+) can act as a first messenger, by interacting with a plasma membrane receptor to set in motion intracellular signaling pathways that involve Ca(2+) itself. Perhaps the most distinctive property of the Ca(2+) signal is its ambivalence: while essential to the correct functioning of cells, Ca(2+) becomes an agent that mediates cell distress, or even (toxic) cell death, if its concentration and movements inside cells are not carefully tuned. Ca(2+) is controlled by reversible complexation to specific proteins, which could be pure Ca(2+) buffers, or which, in addition to buffering Ca(2+), also decode its signal to pass it on to targets. The most important actors in the buffering of cell Ca(2+) are proteins that transport it across the plasma membrane and the membrane of the organelles: some have high Ca(2+) affinity and low transport capacity (e.g., Ca(2+) pumps), others have opposite properties (e.g., the Ca(2+) uptake system of mitochondria). Between the initial event of fertilization, and the terminal event of programmed cell death, the Ca(2+) signal regulates the most important activities of the cell, from the expression of genes, to heart and muscle contraction and other motility processes, to diverse metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cell fuels."

The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle, mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta, epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination). Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50 11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM acetylcholine by 10 nM d-tubocurarine was 29 +/- 5% (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 7), and the inhibition by 10 nM pancuronium was 39 +/- 6% (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 8; P > 0.05 vs. d-tubocurarine). However, in the adult form of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, 10 nM d-tubocurarine and 10 nM pancuronium were both more effective at blocking the response to 100 microM acetylcholine compared to the foetal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, with values of 55 +/- 5% (P < 0.01; n = 12) and 60 +/- 4% (P < 0.001; n = 10), respectively. Thus the developmental switch from the gamma to the epsilon subunit alters the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for both pancuronium and d-tubocurarine. Vecuronium was more potent than pancuronium. One nM vecuronium reduced the response to 100 microM acetylcholine by 71 +- 6% (n = 10) for foetal and 63 +/- 5% (n = 4) for adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor combination, 10 nM pancuronium was a more effective antagonist of the response to 100 microM acetylcholine (69 +/- 6%, n = 6) than 10 nM d-tubocurarine (30 +/- 5%; n = 6; P < 0.05 compared to pancuronium). This is in contrast to the adult muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, where pancuronium and d-tubocurarine were equieffective. The expression of the beta2 subunit with muscle alpha, epsilon and delta subunits formed a functional receptor which was blocked by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine in a similar manner to the alphabeta1epsilondelta subunit consistent with the hypothesis that the beta subunit is not a major determinant in the action of this drug at the adult muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."

Although TBCs are specific to the seminiferous epithelium, they morphologically resemble podosomes in osteoclasts. Previously, we have reported that a key group of proteins consisting of N-WASp, Arp2/3, cortactin and dynamin that occur at podosomes also is present at TBCs. Here we explore the prediction that zyxin, a focal adhesion protein known to be present at podosomes, also is present at apical TBCs. A rabbit polyclonal anti-zyxin antibody (B71) was used to label fixed fragments and frozen sections of testis. In both fragments and sections, B71 labeled tubular regions of TBCs at apical sites of attachment between Sertoli cells and spermatids, in addition to being localized at actin related intercellular adhesion junctions termed ectoplasmic specializations. Although the function of zyxin at TBCs has yet to be determined, the protein is known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of integrins at focal adhesions, and integrins are known to be present in TBCs."

DNMT3A mutations were associated with a normal karyotype and IDH1/2 mutations, but did not affect survival. In contrast to de novo acute myeloid leukemia, most mutations did not affect arginine on position 882, but were predominantly found in the methyltransferase domain. All DNMT3A mutations identified in secondary acute myeloid leukemia were already present in the antecedent disorders indicating an early event. Reduction to homozygosity by uniparental disomy was observed in 2 patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia during disease progression."

To characterize the phenotype of ESS of the uterus, we extracted RNA from ESS and the stroma of normal endometrium using a tissue microdissection system and compared the expression profiles in the two tissues. After suppression subtractive hybridization and differential screening, we detected the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT-1) gene as one of the major genes upregulated in ESS, and a full-length placental cDNA clone (CS0DI066YJ10) as one of the major genes downregulated. The results were confirmed by in situ hybridization in four resected specimens of ESS and 36 biopsy specimens of normal endometrial tissue. All ESS (4/4) and all cases of endometrial stromal cells in the proliferative phase (13/13) were positive for MALAT-1, but samples of normal stroma in the secretory phase and menopausal state included some that were negative or weakly positive for MALAT-1 (5/13 and 3/10, respectively). In contrast, all ESS and 12 of 13 cases of stromal cells in the proliferative phase were negative for the full-length placental cDNA clone but 10 of 13 cases of endometrial stromal cells in the secretory phase were positive for transcripts of the gene (P < 0.05). These results indicated that endometrial stromal cells have different phenotypic characteristics between proliferative and secretory phases and the tumor cells of ESS have the phenotypic character of endometrial stromal cells in the proliferative phase."

Although a decrease in the phosphorylation of both PLB residues (Ser16, PKA site, and Thr17, CaMKII site) was previously reported, experiments from our laboratory failed to detect this decrease. In an attempt to elucidate the cause for this discrepancy, experiments were performed in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts with two main goals: (1) To determine whether keeping pacing during ischemia, a protocol followed in other ischemia-reperfusion models, decreases the phosphorylation of PLB residues, below pre-ischemic values; (2) To investigate whether a maximal beta-adrenergic challenge allows to detect a decrease in the ability of PLB to be phosphorylated in ischemia-reperfused hearts. Hearts were submitted to a global ischemia/reperfusion protocol (20/30 min) with (P) or without (NP) pacing during ischemia, and phosphorylation of PLB residues was assessed by immunodetection. The recovery of contractility upon reperfusion was lower in P vs. NP hearts. Ser16 of PLB, was phosphorylated at the end of ischemia in NP hearts. This increase appeared earlier in P hearts and was significantly diminished by catecholamine depletion and beta-blockade. Thr17 site was phosphorylated at the beginning of ischemia and the onset of reperfusion. The ischemia-induced phosphorylation of Thr17 was higher and more sustained in P vs. NP hearts, and inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, whereas the reperfusion-induced increase in Thr17 phosphorylation was similar in P and NP hearts and was significantly diminished by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943. Phosphorylation of PLB residues did not decrease below basal levels at any time during ischemia and reperfusion. However, the phosphorylation, inotropic and lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation was significantly decreased both in P and NP hearts."

Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes.

The translocation of phosphatidylserine has been evidenced by using either derivatization of anionic phospholipids with trinitrobenzenesulfonate (TNBS) or cytofluorimetry after labeling of cells with antiphosphatidylserine antibodies. The perturbation of membrane phospholipids induced by anti-E2 mAbs was further evidenced by labeling the cells with merocyanine 540. The specificity of anti-E2-induced perturbations of membrane asymmetry was tested by using a number of mAbs able to activate T cells, including CD3 and CD2. The results strongly suggest that anti-E2-induced changes in PtdSer are related to cell aggregation since the same mAbs specifically induce the aggregation of both thymocytes and Jurkat cells and since the E2 molecule has been previously implicated in the adhesive properties of human T cells with erythrocytes."

In the 90s, lin-4 and let-7 were firstly identified as small regulatory RNAs able to control C. elegans larval development, by specifically targeting the 3'UTR of lin-14 and lin-28, respectively. These findings have introduced a novel and wide layer of complexity in the regulation of mRNA and protein expression. Lin-4 and let-7 are now considered the founding members of an abundant class of small fine-tuned RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), in viruses, green algae, plants, flies, worms, and in mammals. In humans, the estimated number of genes encoding for miRNAs is as high as 1000 and around 30% of the protein-coding genes are post-transcriptionally controlled by miRNAs. This article reviews the role of miRNAs in regulating several biological responses in muscle cells, ranging from proliferation, differentiation and adaptation to stress cues. Cardiac and skeletal muscles are powerful examples to summarize the activity of miRNAs in cell fate specification, lineage differentiation and metabolic pathways. Indeed, specific miRNAs control the number of proliferating muscle progenitors to guarantee the proper formation of the heart and muscle fibers and to assure the self-renewal of muscle progenitors during adult tissue regeneration. On the other side, several other miRNAs promote the differentiation of muscle progenitors into skeletal myofibers or into cardiomyocytes, where metabolic activity, survival and remodeling process in response to stress, injury and chronic diseases are also fine-tuned by miRNAs."

The newer, novel antipsychotics offer advantages over conventional antipsychotics, especially a relative lack of extrapyramidal symptoms, but some still have the disadvantage of causing weight gain. Clozapine and olanzapine in particular appear to cause substantial weight gain, much more so than do most conventional neuroleptics and novel agents such as risperidone.

Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable? We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences between mammalian Alu families."

Sir2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in budding yeast and worms. Here, we show that SIRT1, the human Sir2 homolog, is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras (Ha-rasV12). SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53, a component of PML nuclear bodies, and it can repress p53-mediated transactivation. Moreover, we show that SIRT1 and p53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation. When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence. Taken together, our data establish the SIRT1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence."

Here, using a new inducible deletion system, we show that deletion of Tsc1 in mouse primary mammary tumor cells, either before or after their transplantation, significantly increased their growth in vivo. The increase in tumor growth was completely rescued by rapamycin treatment, suggesting a major contribution from mTORC1 hyperactivation. Interestingly, glucose starvation-induced autophagy, but not amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, was increased significantly in Tsc1-null tumor cells. Further analysis of these cells also showed an increased Akt activation but no significant changes in Erk signaling. Together, these results provide insights into the mechanism by which hyperactivation of mTORC1 promotes breast cancer progression through increasing autophagy and Akt activation in vivo. "

Elevated HMT in PiD could lead to increased histamine degradation that in turn would be in agreement with impaired cognitive functions of PiD.

A panel of biomarkers to characterise tumours of different grades that could also distinguish between patients exhibiting the disease with first incidence or recurrence could be useful for bladder cancer diagnostics. In this study, potential metabolic biomarkers have been discovered through mass spectrometry based metabolomics of urine. Pre-treatment urine samples were collected from 48 patients diagnosed of urothelial bladder cancer. Patients were followed-up through the hospital pathological charts to identify whether and when the disease recurred or progressed. Subsequently, they were classified according to whether or not they suffered a tumour recurrence (recurrent or stable) as well as their risk group according to tumour grade and stage. Identified metabolites have been analysed in terms of disease characteristics (tumour stage and recurrence) and have provided an insight into bladder cancer progression. Using both liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, a total of 27 metabolite features were highlighted as significantly different between patient groups. Some, for example histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan have been previously linked with bladder cancer, however until now their connection with bladder cancer progression has not been previously reported. The candidate biomarkers revealed in this study could be useful in the clinic for diagnosis of bladder cancer and, through characterising the stage of the disease, could also be useful in prognostics.

Tumor angiogenesis is highly regulated by multiple intracellular signaling transduction cascades such as Hedgehog, STAT3, Akt and p70S6K pathways that are known to malfunction in many types of cancer including colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, suppression of tumor angiogenesis through targeting these signaling pathways has become a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy. Ursolic acid (UA) is a major active compound present in many medicinal herbs that have long been used in China for the clinical treatment of various types of cancer. Although previous studies have demonstrated an antitumor effect for UA, the precise mechanisms of its anti-angiogenic activity are not well understood. To further elucidate the mechanism(s) of the tumorcidal activity of UA, using a CRC mouse xenograft model, chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, the human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), in the present study we evaluated the efficacy of UA against tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that administration of UA significantly inhibited tumor volume but had no effect on body weight changes in CRC mice, suggesting that UA can suppress colon cancer growth in vivo without noticeable signs of toxicity. In addition, UA treatment reduced intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) in CRC mice, decreased the total number of blood vessels in the CAM model, and dose and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, demonstrating UA's antitumor angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, UA treatment inhibited the expression of critical angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A and bFGF. Furthermore, UA suppressed the activation of sonic hedgehog (SHH), STAT3, Akt and p70S6K pathways. Collectively, our findings suggest that inhibition of tumor angiogenesis via suppression of multiple signaling pathways might be one of the mechanisms whereby UA can be effective in cancer treatment."

In this Perspectives article, GBS and MFS are classified on the basis of current understanding of the common pathophysiological profiles of each disease phenotype. GBS is subclassified into classic and localized forms (for example, pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness and bifacial weakness with paraesthesias), and MFS is divided into incomplete (for example, acute ophthalmoparesis, acute ataxic neuropathy) and CNS subtypes (Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis).

The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process."

NLK acts as a negative regulator of FOXO transcriptional activity. For FOXO4 we show that NLK-mediated loss of FOXO4 activity co-occurs with inhibition of FOXO4 monoubiquitination. Previously, we have shown that oxidative stress-induced monoubiquitination of FOXO4 stimulates its transactivation, which leads to activation of an antioxidant defensive program. Conversely, NLK-dependent inhibition of FOXO4 activity can provide a means to downregulate this defensive program, when oxidative stress reaches a level beyond which repair is no longer feasible and cells need to undergo apoptosis."

This is reflected in their complex patterns of expression. In molecular terms these functions are largely unknown. Certain splice variants (CD44v) can promote the metastatic behaviour of cancer cells. In human colon and breast cancer the presence of epitopes encoded by exon v6 on primary resected tumour material indicates poor prognosis. Metastasis-promoting splice variants differ from those that seem not to have a role in the induction of metastasis by the formation of homomultimeric complexes in the plasma membrane of cells. This may increase their affinity to ligands such as hyaluronate. The affinity can be further regulated over a range from low to very high by cell-specific modification. The fact that CD44v epitopes are found on normal epithelial cells such as skin, cervical epithelium and bladder enforces cautious evaluation of the significance of CD44v expression in human cancer. Nevertheless, certain epitopes can serve as tools in early diagnosis of certain cancers and will facilitate the development of specific targeted therapy."

All had an unstable bladder at cystometry. A bladder regimen was emphasised during the study. Continence was improved according to micturition charting and a pad test in both groups. Terodiline at 25 mg/day, however, gave significantly better results than placebo. In patients with a subnormal bladder capacity (less than or equal to 150 ml), a significant increase in capacity was recorded on cystometry during medication with terodiline but not with placebo. The improved continence seen in the placebo group was probably due to the non-specific bladder training achieved by the child's increased awareness and adult involvement during treatment. The even better results attained in the terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence, particularly since no important adverse effects were noted during an 8-week period."

The most common form is rapidly progressive with glycogen storage, particularly in muscle, which leads to profound weakness, cardiac failure, and death by the age of 2 years. Although usually considered a muscle disease, glycogen storage also occurs in the CNS. We evaluated the progression of neuropathologic and behavioral abnormalities in a Pompe disease mouse model (6neo/6neo) that displays many features of the human disease. Homozygous mutant mice store excess glycogen within large neurons of hindbrain, spinal cord, and sensory ganglia by the age of 1 month; accumulations then spread progressively within many CNS cell types. \"Silver degeneration\" and Fluoro-Jade C stains revealed severe degeneration in axon terminals of primary sensory neurons at 3 to 9 months. These abnormalities were accompanied by progressive behavioral impairment on rotorod, wire hanging, and foot fault tests. The extensive neuropathologic alterations in this model suggest that therapy of skeletal and cardiac muscle disorders by systemic enzyme replacement therapy may not be sufficient to reverse functional deficits due to CNS glycogen storage, particularly early-onset, rapidly progressive disease. A better understanding of the basis for clinical manifestations is needed to correlate CNS pathology with Pompe disease manifestations."

By using in vitro approaches, hESC-CM are able to be activated with light. ChR2 is stably transduced into undifferentiated hESC via a lentiviral vector. Via directed differentiation, hESC(ChR2)-CM are produced and subjected to optical stimulation. hESC(ChR2)-CM respond to traditional electrical stimulation and produce similar contractility features as their wild-type counterparts but only hESC(ChR2)-CM can be activated by optical stimulation. Here it is shown that a light sensitive protein can enable in vitro optical control of hESC-CM and that this activation occurs optimally above specific light stimulation intensity and pulse width thresholds. For future therapy, in vivo optical stimulation along with optical inhibition could allow for acute synchronization of implanted hPSC-CM with patient cardiac rhythms. "

Our analysis of the structural dynamics of SLN in DPC micelles shows this polypeptide to be partitioned into four subdomains: a short unstructured N terminus (residues 1-6), a short dynamic helix (residues 7-14), a more rigid helix (residues 15-26), and an unstructured C terminus (residues 27-31). Upon addition of SERCA, the different domains behave according to their dynamics, molding onto the surface of the enzyme. Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms."

Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis by controlling the transcription of translation initiation factors as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. Moreover, the circadian oscillator directly regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Thus the circadian clock exerts a major role in coordinating transcription and translation steps underlying ribosome biogenesis."

Since binary transposons can be produced as common plasmids they provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative to viral delivery methods. Here, we compared the efficiency of two different transposon systems, Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB), for the generation of murine iPS. Murine fibroblasts derived from an inbred BL/6 mouse line carrying a pluripotency reporter, Oct4-EGFP, and fibroblasts derived from outbred NMRI mice were employed for reprogramming. Both transposon systems resulted in the successful isolation of murine iPS cell lines. The reduction of the core reprogramming factors to omit the proto-oncogene c-Myc was compatible with iPS cell line derivation, albeit with reduced reprogramming efficiencies. The transposon-derived iPS cells featured typical hallmarks of pluripotency, including teratoma growth in immunodeficient mice. Thus SB and PB transposons represent a promising non-viral approach for iPS cell derivation. "

The classical antithrombotic treatment of atrial fibrillation is based on vitamin K antagonists. Trials made in the 90's have clearly shown that vitamin K antagonists were able to decrease stroke risk by about 60%. New oral anticoagulants are now available on the market to treat patients with atrial fibrillation. These drugs are dabigatran which has demonstrated an interest in the RE-LY trial. Two doses may be prescribed, 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid. Anti Xa have also demonstrated an interest : rivaroxaban in the ROCKET AF trial and apixaban in the AVERROES (versus aspirin) and ARISTOTLE trials. In the future these drugs will have a major place in the armamentarium used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation.

The major posttranslational modification of \u03b1-syn is phosphorylation at S129, and previous studies estimate that approximately 90% of \u03b1-syn in proteinaceous, pathological inclusions is phosphorylated at this site. \u03b1-Syn can be phosphorylated by polo-like kinases (PLKs) 1-3 and casein kinases (CK) 1 and 2; however, the kinases associated with the hyperphosphorylation of aggregated \u03b1-syn are still under debate. Using a high-efficiency cellular model of \u03b1-syn aggregate formation, we found that selective inhibitors for CK2 and PLKs each partially inhibited S129 phosphorylation of soluble (nonaggregated) \u03b1-syn, but only PLK inhibitors modestly attenuated the phosphorylation of aggregated \u03b1-syn. In addition, none of the kinase inhibitors used had a substantial effect on the propensity of \u03b1-syn to aggregate. Overexpression of all PLKs promoted robust phosphorylation of soluble \u03b1-syn, but none altered the propensity of \u03b1-syn to aggregate. Overexpression of only PLK2 increased phosphorylation of aggregated \u03b1-syn at S129, which likely is due to increased phosphorylation of soluble \u03b1-syn, which then was incorporated into aggregates. Overexpression of PLK1 and treatment with BI2536 resulted in a significant reduction of phosphorylated, aggregated \u03b1-syn protein, beyond that of BI2536 treatment alone. These studies suggest that phosphorylation of \u03b1-syn is independent of \u03b1-syn aggregate formation, that PLK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of aggregated \u03b1-syn at S129 in this system, and that mechanisms resulting in hyperphosphorylation of aggregated \u03b1-syn appear to be independent of those responsible for the phosphorylation of soluble \u03b1-syn."

Thus the cEDS patients have pathological connective tissue morphology and low stiffness, but the rate of connective tissue protein turnover is unknown. We investigated whether cEDS affected the protein synthesis rate in skin and tendon, and whether this could be stimulated in tendon tissue with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Five patients with cEDS and 10 healthy, matched controls (CTRL) were included. One patellar tendon of each participant was injected with 0.1 ml IGF-I (Increlex, Ipsen, 10 mg/ml) and the contralateral tendon with 0.1 ml isotonic saline as control. The injections were performed at both 24 and 6 h prior to tissue sampling. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of proteins in skin and tendon was measured with the stable isotope technique using a flood-primed continuous infusion over 6 h. After the infusion one skin biopsy and two tendon biopsies (one from each patellar tendon) were obtained. We found similar baseline FSR values in skin and tendon in the cEDS patients and controls [skin: 0.005 \u00b1 0.002 (cEDS) and 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL); tendon: 0.008 \u00b1 0.001 (cEDS) and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL) %/h, mean \u00b1 SE]. IGF-I injections significantly increased FSR values in cEDS patients but not in controls (delta values: cEDS 0.007 \u00b1 0.002, CTRL 0.001 \u00b1 0.001%/h). In conclusion, baseline protein synthesis rates in connective tissue appeared normal in cEDS patients, and the patients responded with an increased tendon protein synthesis rate to IGF-I injections.

Using the segmentation algorithm based on the quadratic divergence, we re-determined all 79 boundaries of previously identified human isochores at single-nucleotide resolution, and then compared the boundary coordinates with other genome features. We found that 55.7% of isochore boundaries coincide with termini of repeat elements; 45.6% of isochore boundaries coincide with termini of highly conserved sequences based on alignment of 17 vertebrate genomes, i.e., the highly conserved genome sequence switches to a less or non-conserved one at the isochore boundary; some isochore boundaries coincide with abrupt change of CpG island distribution (note that one boundary can associate with more than one genome feature). In addition, sequences around isochore boundaries are highly conserved. It seems reasonable to deduce that the boundaries of all the isochores studied here would be replication timing sites in the human genome. These results suggest possible key roles of the isochore boundaries and may further our understanding of the human genome organization."

We identify G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a key novel stimulator of HDAC6. GRK2, which levels inversely correlate with the extent of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase activity. Remarkably, phosphorylation of GRK2 itself at S670 specifically potentiates its ability to regulate HDAC6. GRK2 and HDAC6 colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility. Consistently, cells expressing GRK2-K220R or GRK2-S670A mutants, unable to phosphorylate HDAC6, exhibit highly acetylated cortical MTs and display impaired migration and protrusive activity. Finally, we find that a balanced, GRK2/HDAC6-mediated regulation of tubulin acetylation differentially modulates the early and late stages of cellular spreading. This novel GRK2/HDAC6 functional interaction may have important implications in pathological contexts."

The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, therefore rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be started as soon as possible."

NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS. A critical analysis of the NXY-059 preclinical data, however, reveals several shortcomings that have not been addressed in the literature. This report contends that the preclinical evaluation of NXY-059 lacked strenuous testing and was not shown to reproducibly lead to robust protection in extended time windows in clinically relevant stroke models, at several different academic research laboratories. The clinical trials of NXY-059 were inadequately designed, in part, because of inappropriate treatment windows and inclusion of diverse stroke patients. Future neuroprotective agents need more rigorous testing in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia and appropriate evaluation in clinical studies that better match the preclinical data."

Here we report that Cfp1 plays unanticipated roles in organizing genome-wide H3K4me3 in embryonic stem cells. Cfp1 deficiency caused two contrasting phenotypes: drastic loss of H3K4me3 at expressed CGI-associated genes, with minimal consequences for transcription, and creation of \"ectopic\" H3K4me3 peaks at numerous regulatory regions. DNA binding by Cfp1 was dispensable for targeting H3K4me3 to active genes but was required to prevent ectopic H3K4me3 peaks. The presence of ectopic peaks at enhancers often coincided with increased expression of nearby genes. This suggests that CpG targeting prevents \"leakage\" of H3K4me3 to inappropriate chromatin compartments. Our results demonstrate that Cfp1 is a specificity factor that integrates multiple signals, including promoter CpG content and gene activity, to regulate genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3."

The frequent coexistence in these patients of microangiopathy and coronary artery disease was observed more than 30 years ago and later verified in large epidemiological studies. Thus, the subgroup (30-40%) of patients who develop clinical nephropathy, also are at extremely high risk of early cardiovascular death. A number of established cardiovascular risk factors are present not only in advanced clinical nephropathy but also in its earliest stages. These include elevated blood pressure, atherogenic changes in the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins, elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen and probably hyperreactivity of platelets. However, it seems unlikely that these risk factors fully explain the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with clinical nephropathy. Patients with slightly elevated urinary albumin excretion are at increased risk of developing not only clinical nephropathy and coronary heart disease but also proliferative retinopathy and cardiomyopathy. We have, therefore, hypothesised that elevated urinary albumin excretion is a marker of generalized disease in the vascular wall of small and large blood vessels. Findings of elevated transcapillary escape rate of albumin, elevated plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor and impaired fibrinolytic capacity in early diabetic nephropathy have supported this hypothesis. However, the initial pathophysiological mechanisms involved are still hypothetical and largely unknown. During recent years the incidence of clinical nephropathy has declined and the prognosis of insulin-dependent diabetic patients has improved. Whether intervention directed against the often clustered cardiovascular risk factors will further improve the prognosis in proteinuric patients is suggested but still unknown. However, the key question is still, why is the vascular wall, in small and large blood vessels, vulnerable in some but not all diabetic patients? In the future more studies of the initial pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this vulnerability are needed."

The fixation of the beneficial allele not only affects sequence diversity at single neutral loci but also the joint allele distribution of several partially linked neutral loci. This distribution can be studied using the ancestral recombination graph for samples of partially linked neutral loci during the selective sweep. To approximate this graph, we extend recent work by Etheridge et al. (Ann Appl Probab 16:685-729, 2006) and Schweinsberg and Durrett (Ann Appl Probab 15:1591-1651, 2005) using a marked Yule tree for the genealogy at a single neutral locus linked to a strongly beneficial one. We focus on joint genealogies at two partially linked neutral loci in the case of large selection coefficients alpha and recombination rates rho = theta(alpha/log alpha) between loci. Our approach leads to a full description of the genealogy with accuracy of theta((log alpha)(-2)) in probability.

The response to vitamin E supplementation in specific patient subpopulations with chronic inflammation and/or higher degrees of oxidative stress has not been studied as yet. Therefore, further large randomized interventional trials are warranted to clarify accurately the role of vitamin E in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic coronary disease in these patient groups."

The activity of this enzyme is increased in hypothyroidism and decreased in hyperthyroidism, and as such, it serves an important role to protect the brain from wide fluctuations in T3 during changes in thyroidal state. Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. To assess the 5'-D2 mRNA response to injury, we performed in situ hybridization following traumatic brain injury. In unlesioned animals, 5'-D2 mRNA was undetectable. At 3 days posttrauma, 5'-D2 mRNA was detected in ipsilateral cortex near the contusion. A significant further increase of 5'-D2 mRNA was noted 7 days posttrauma in both hippocampus and cortex. Similar response was also observed on the contralateral side. Colocalization of 5'-D2 mRNA with glial fibrillary acidic protein indicates that reactive astrocytes were the major cellular source for the trauma-induced 5'-D2 expression. These data demonstrate, for the first time, a trauma-induced, astrocytic up-regulation of 5'-D2 mRNA, suggesting a potential role for T3 action in adult brain's response to injury and recovery."

Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs."

Different polyubiquitin chains have different functions. Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair. For this reason, chain topology must be tightly controlled. Using the U-box E3 ligase CHIP [C-terminus of the Hsc (heat-shock cognate) 70-interacting protein] and the RING E3 ligase TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) with the E2s Ubc13 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13)-Uev1a (ubiquitin E2 variant 1a) and UbcH5a, in the present study we demonstrate that Ubc13-Uev1a supports the formation of free Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin chains not attached to CHIP or TRAF6, whereas UbcH5a catalyses the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked to CHIP and TRAF6 that lack specificity for any lysine residue of ubiquitin. Therefore the abilities of these E2s to ubiquitinate a substrate and to elongate polyubiquitin chains of a specific topology appear to be mutually exclusive. Thus two different classes of E2 may be required to attach a polyubiquitin chain of a particular topology to a substrate: the properties of one E2 are designed to mono-ubiquitinate a substrate with no or little inherent specificity for an acceptor lysine residue, whereas the properties of the second E2 are tailored to the elongation of a polyubiquitin chain using a defined lysine residue of ubiquitin."

Many confounding elements are influencing the evaluation of these investigations which must be taken into consideration. Authors argue for the use of age specific reference limits for TSH (especially in older age, where TSH level is often shifted to a higher level) to avoid significant misclassification of patients with abnormal TSH who may or may not have thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased ischemic heart disease risk, mainly in individuals under the age of 65 years. In the future, well designed prospective randomized studies with age stratified groups and vascular events as the primary endpoint are required and it is anticipated that these studies will give the proper answer whether early substitution therapy with thyroxin will be able to reverse the ischemic heart disease risk in affected patients."

Intermediate filaments of the non-sarcomeric cytoskeleton are not essential for development but important for maintenance of myofibrils. Myofibrils consist of contractile proteins involved in force generation and the muscle cytoskeleton framework. The latter is essential for proper assembly and maintenance as well as for interaction with other cardiomyocytes or the extracellular matrix, thus being involved in force transmission. The information for sarcomere assembly is encoded in the proteins and some domains essential for faithful incorporation have been identified by epitope tagging experiments. Many KO mutations result in embryonic lethal phenotypes and new techniques e.g. using cardiomyocytes derived from ES cell-lines will have to be developed that allow to study such mutations in cardiomyocytes rather than whole organisms. Alterations in the expression levels of several proteins of the muscle cytoskeleton or impairment of their function by point mutations can result in increased mechanical stress in the cardiomyocytes which finally leads to cellular responses such as the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MLP (muscle-LIM-protein) deficient mice develop DCM and changes in the mechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes result in alterations at the intercalated disks and enhanced accumulation of adherens junction proteins. Therefore, controlled interactions between proteins of the muscle cytoskeleton and contractile proteins are essential to ensure proper cardiac function and a more detailed insight in these processes might provide new tools to improve the contractile efficiency of the cardiomyocytes and thus working output in cardiomyopathies."

Core to NS2 make up the assembly module while NS3 to NS5B represent the replication module (replicase).

Initiation from oriK sites occurs in RNase HI-deficient mutants, and possibly in wild-type cells under certain unusual conditions. Despite previous work, the locations of oriK and their impact on genome stability remain unclear. We combined 2D gel electrophoresis and whole genome approaches to map genome-wide oriK locations. The DNA copy number profiles of various RNase HI-deficient strains contained multiple peaks, often in consistent locations, identifying candidate oriK sites. Removal of RNase HI protein also leads to global alterations of replication fork migration patterns, often opposite to normal replication directions, and presumably eukaryote-like replication fork merging. Our results have implications for genome stability, offering a new understanding of how RNase HI deficiency results in R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflict, as well as inappropriate replication stalling or blockage at Ter sites outside of the terminus trap region and at ribosomal operons."

Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. A significant positive correlation is also detected between the human germline mutation rate and expression level. These results indicate that transcription is overall mutagenic."

To meaningfully increase survival, a trimodality approach of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy is needed. Carmustine (1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) is a nitrosourea alkylating agent that exerts its antitumor effect by akylating DNA and RNA. Systemic administration of nitrosoureas as a single agent or as part of procarbazine/3-cyclohexyl-1-nitroso-urea/vincristine has demonstrated little efficacy in the treatment of high-grade glioma. The development of carmustine wafers (Gliadel((R)) Wafer) as a method for controlled released delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers enhances the therapeutic ratio by fully containing the drug within the confines of the brain tumor environment while minimizing systemic toxicities. Preclinical and clinical studies have proven the safety and efficacy of Gliadel in the management of glioblastoma. From these results, Gliadel is currently approved for use in patients with recurrent glioblastoma as an adjunct to surgery and in newly diagnosed patients with high-grade glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation. Other promising advances in the use of locally delivered chemotherapy for CNS malignancies, including Gliadel for brain metastases and combination therapies with systemic or biologic agents, are discussed."

Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). Fractionation and membrane co-immune precipitations further confirm that siRNA-loaded Ago2 physically associates with the cytosolic side of the rER membrane. Additionally, RLC-associated double-stranded siRNA, diagnostic of RISC loading, and RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage products exclusively co-sediment with rER. Finally, we identify TRBP and PACT as key factors anchoring RISC to ER membranes in an RNA-independent manner. Together, our findings demonstrate that the outer rER membrane is a central nucleation site of siRNA-mediated RNA silencing."

The use of this DNA for non-invasive detection of fetal aneuploidies using massively parallel sequencing (MPS)-by-synthesis has been proven previously. Sequence performance may, however, depend on the MPS platform and therefore we have explored the possibility for multiplex MPS-by-ligation, using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD(\u2122) 4 system. DNA isolated from plasma samples from 52 pregnant women, carrying normal or aneuploid fetuses, was sequenced in multiplex runs of 4, 8 or 16 samples simultaneously. The sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome and quantified according to their genomic location. In case of a fetal aneuploidy, the number of reads of the aberrant chromosome is expected to be higher or lower than in normal reference samples. To statistically determine this, Z-scores per chromosome were calculated as described previously, with thresholds for aneuploidies set at > +3.0 and < -3.0 for chromosomal over- or underrepresentation, respectively. All samples from fetal aneuploidies yielded Z-scores outside the thresholds for the aberrant chromosomes, with no false negative or positive results. Full-blown fetal aneuploidies can thus be reliably detected in maternal plasma using a multiplex MPS-by-ligation approach. Furthermore, the results obtained with a sample from a pregnancy with 45,X in the cytotrophoblastic cell layer and 46,XX in the mesenchymal core cells show that ccffDNA originates from the cytotrophoblastic cell layer. Discrepancies between the genetic constitution of this cell layer and the fetus itself are well known, and therefore, care should be taken when translating results to the fetus itself."

The signal transduction pathways underlying these effects are just beginning to be defined. We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1. The phosphorylation of Akt was T3 specific and dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85alpha subunit and the thyroid receptor beta1 were able to form a complex at the cytoplasmic level in both the cell lines, suggesting that a 'cytoplasmic TRbeta1' was implicated. Moreover, we evidenced that T3 treatment was able to induce kinase activity of the TRbeta1-associated PI3K. The silencing of TRbeta1 expression through RNAi confirmed this receptor to be crucial for the T3-induced activation of Akt. This action involved a T3-induced nuclear translocation of activated Akt, as demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence. In summary, T3 is able to specifically activate Akt in the islet beta cells rRINm5F and hCM through the interaction between TRbeta1 and PI3K p85alpha, demonstrating the involvement of TRbeta1 in this novel T3 non-genomic action in islet beta cells."

Furthermore, some substitution signatures are more frequent in certain DNA replication timing zones. Finally, integrating data on higher-order nuclear organization, we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves. These data suggest that DNA replication timing together with higher-order genomic organization contribute to the patterns of single-nucleotide substitution in normal and cancer genomes."

The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of 1) human labor, proinflammatory cytokines, and bacterial endotoxin LPS on NOD1 and NOD2 expression and 2) NOD1 and NOD2 activation on the expression of prolabor mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. NOD1 and NOD2 expression was significantly higher in fetal membranes and myometrium after spontaneous labor when compared to nonlaboring tissues. Bacterial endotoxin LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B significantly increased NOD2, but not NOD1, expression. Furthermore, LPS-induced NOD2 expression was decreased by the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. In both fetal membranes and myometrium, the NOD1 ligand bacterial iE-DAP and the NOD2 ligand bacterial MDP significantly increased the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8), cyclooxygenase (PTGS2) expression and subsequent release of prostaglandins PGE2 and PGF2alpha, and the expression and activity of MMP9. The effects of these NOD1 and NOD2 ligands were mediated via NFKB, as 1) both iE-DAP and MDP significantly increased NFKB activation and 2) the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 attenuated iE-DAP- and MDP-induced expression and secretion of prolabor mediators. In conclusion, NOD1 and NOD2 are increased in laboring fetal membranes and myometrium and with bacterial infection. Agonist activation of NOD1 and NOD2 by bacterial products leads to NFKB activation and transcription of NFKB induced prolabor genes. NOD1 and NOD2 may thus represent therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or management of preterm birth. "

Consistently, the Ca(2+) content, normally depleted from the SR in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), remained elevated in these cells. In contrast, the density and the ryanodine-binding kinetics of the ryanodine receptor (RyR)/Ca(2+) release channel were slightly reduced or not significantly altered in the HRC overexpressing cardiomyocytes.

At physiological pH, dissociation of the phenolic -OH group of these iodothyronines is an important determinant of their physical chemistry that impacts on their biological effects. When non-ionized these iodothyronines are strongly amphipathic. It is proposed that iodothyronines are normal constituents of biological membranes in vertebrates. In plasma of adult vertebrates, unbound T4 and T3 are regulated in the picomolar range whilst protein-bound T4 and T3 are maintained in the nanomolar range. The function of thyroid-hormone-binding plasma proteins is to ensure an even distrubtion throughout the body. Various iodothyronines are produced by three types of membrane-bound cellular deiodinase enzyme systems in vertebrates. The distribution of deiodinases varies between tissues and each has a distinct developmental profile. Thyroid hormones. (1) the nuclear receptor mode is especially important in the thyroid hormone axis that controls plasma and cellular levels of these hormones. (2) These hormones are strongly associated with membranes in tissues and normally rigidify these membranes.  (3) They also affect the acyl composition of membrane bilayers and it is suggested that this is due to the cells responding to thyroid-hormone-induced membrane rigidificataion. Both their immediate effects on the physical state of membranes and the consequent changes in membrane composition result in several other thyroid hormone effects. Effects on metabolism may be due primarily to membrane acyl changes. There are other actions of thyroid hormones involving membrane receptors and influences on cellular interactions with the extracellulara matrix. The effects of thyroid hormones are reviewed and appear to b combinations of these various modes of action.  During development, vertebrates show a surge in T4 and other thyroid hormones, as well as distinctive profiles in the appearance of the deiodinase enzymes and nuclear receptors. Evidence from the use of analogues supports multiple modes of action. Re-examination of data from th early 1960s supports a membrane action. Findings from receptor 'knockout'  mice supports an important role for receptors in the development of the thyroid axis. These iodothyronines may be better thought of as 'vitamone'-like molecules than traditional hormonal messengers."

Yet, little is known about their functional role under non-DNA damage-inducing conditions. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16% of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of \u223c2% of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events.

To date, the database catalogs 1,274 manually-curated pathogenic sequence variants and 170 allelic variants in intermediate filament genes from over 459 peer-reviewed research articles. Unrelated cases were collected from all of the six sequence homology groups and the sequence variations were described at cDNA and protein levels with links to the related diseases and reference articles. The mutations and polymorphisms are presented in parallel with data on protein structure, gene, and chromosomal location and basic information on associated diseases. Detailed statistics relating to the variants records in the database are displayed by homology group, mutation type, affected domain, associated diseases, and nucleic and amino acid substitutions. Multiple sequence alignment algorithms can be run from queries to determine DNA or protein sequence conservation. Literature sources can be interrogated within the database and external links are provided to public databases. The database is freely and publicly accessible online at www.interfil.org (last accessed 13 September 2007). Users can query the database by various keywords and the search results can be downloaded. It is anticipated that the Human Intermediate Filament Database (HIFD) will provide a useful resource to study human genome variations for basic scientists, clinicians, and students alike."

Selenium status also modifies the effect of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) SNP Ala16Val on prostate cancer risk. We investigated the relationship of these SNPs with prostate cancer risk. DNA from 2,975 cases and 1,896 age-matched controls from the population-based Prostate Cancer in Sweden study were genotyped using TaqMan assays. Cases were designated aggressive or nonaggressive prostate cancers at diagnosis by clinical criteria. Association with prostate cancer was investigated by logistic regression; gene-gene interaction using a general linear model. The mean plasma selenium concentration measured in 169 controls was relatively low (76.0 +/- 17.2 microg/L). SNP genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. SOD2-Ala16+ men were at a greater risk of prostate cancer [odds ratios (OR), 1.19; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.03-1.37] compared with SOD2-Val16 homozygotes. Men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 who were also SOD2-Ala16+ had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.76) and aggressive prostate cancer (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22-2.09) than those who were SOD2-Val16 homozygotes (interaction, prostate cancer P = 0.05; aggressive prostate cancer P = 0.01).

In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration."

Fork assembly outside the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) is mediated by recombination or via a helicase-dependent pathway. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. We review evidence suggesting that R-loops are frequent during normal cell growth and that R-loops are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed. Unlike recombination and helicase-dependent fork restoration, this mechanism would operate preferentially in transcribed areas of the genome, which are known to be particularly susceptible to DNA damage. Our model emphasizes the intimate relationship between transcription and repair, offers a unifying interpretation of phenotypes attributed to bacterial strains deficient in R-loop fork assembly, and calls for a renewed focus on R-loop formation and regulation."

Although STAT3 is best known as a pro-inflammatory and oncogenic transcription factor, mechanistic analyses revealed that autophagy is regulated by the cytoplasmic, not nuclear, pool of STAT3. Cytoplasmic STAT3 normally interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, subunit 1\u03b1, 35kDa (EIF2S1/eIF2\u03b1) kinase 2/protein kinase, RNA-activated (EIF2AK2/PKR), a sensor of double-stranded RNA. This interaction, which could be recapitulated using recombinant proteins in pull-down experiments, involves the catalytic domain of EIF2AK2 as well as the SH2 domain of STAT3, which can adopt a fold similar to that of EIF2S1. Thus, STAT3 may act as a competitive inhibitor of EIF2AK2. Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type STAT3 as well as of STAT3 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by JAK2 or are excluded from the nucleus inhibits autophagy. However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy. Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula, yet only the latter does so in cell-free systems in vitro. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1. These results reveal an unsuspected crosstalk between cellular metabolism (fatty acids), pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3), innate immunity (EIF2AK2), and translational control (EIF2S1) that regulates autophagy."

Regulated in vivo occupancy of such sites may yield structurally and functionally distinct CTCF/DNA complexes involved in various aspects of gene regulation, including epigenetic control of gene imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. The latter functions are mediated by meCpG-sensitive 11ZF binding. Because CTCF is normally present in all somatic cells, whereas BORIS is active only in CTCF- and 5-methylcytosine-deficient adult male germ cells, switching DNA occupancy from CTCF to BORIS was suggested to regulate site specificity and timing of epigenetic reprogramming. In addition to 11ZF-binding paternal imprinting control regions, cancer-testis gene promoters also undergo remethylation during CTCF/BORIS switching in germ cells. Only promoters of cancer testis genes are normally silenced in all somatic cells but activated during spermatogenesis when demethylated in BORIS-positive germ cells and are found aberrantly derepressed in various tumors. We show here that BORIS is also expressed in multiple cancers and is thus itself a cancer-testis gene and that conditional expression of BORIS in normal fibroblasts activates cancer-testis genes selectively. We tested if replacement of CTCF by BORIS on regulatory DNA occurs in vivo on activation of a prototype cancer-testis gene, MAGE-A1. Transition from a hypermethylated/silenced to a hypomethylated/activated status induced in normal cells by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) was mimicked by conditional input of BORIS and is associated with complete switching from CTCF to BORIS occupancy at a single 11ZF target. This site manifested a novel type of CTCF/BORIS 11ZF binding insensitive to CpG methylation. Whereas 5-azadC induction of BORIS takes only few hours, derepression of MAGE-A1 occurred 1 to 2 days later, suggesting that BORIS mediates cancer-testis gene activation by 5-azadC. Indeed, infection of normal fibroblasts with anti-BORIS short hairpin RNA retroviruses before treatment with 5-azadC blocked reactivation of MAGE-A1. We suggest that BORIS is likely tethering epigenetic machinery to a novel class of CTCF/BORIS 11ZF target sequences that mediate induction of cancer-testis genes."

Sidekick-1 and its ortholog sidekick-2 have also been shown to function as neuronal targeting molecules, guiding developing neurons to specific synapses. In the current work, we overexpress mouse sidekick-1 and -2 in HEK 293 T cells in order to characterize their binding specificities. Cells transiently transfected with either sidekick-1 or -2 cDNA formed separate aggregates when mixed together, demonstrating that sidekicks are homophilic adhesion molecules. The transfection of the short splice variant (lacking the first two Ig domains) or a construct encoding sidekick-1 with the second Ig domain deleted both resulted in nearly abolished adhesion. A beta-sheet strand peptide containing the sequence QLVILA corresponding to an amino acid sequence in the second Ig domain of sidekick-1 showed specific interaction with the recombinant first Ig domain-His protein of sidekick-1. Cells expressing a mutant sidekick-1 where the binding sequence QLVILA is deleted failed to mediate significant adhesion. Furthermore, cells transfected with a chimeric sidekick, where the first two Ig domains of sidekick-2 are replaced with the corresponding two Ig domains of sidekick-1, form aggregates with sidekick-1-transfected cells. The reverse chimera, where the first two Ig domains of sidekick-2 are substituted onto sidekick-1, was similarly able to form aggregates with sidekick-2-transfected cells. These results establish that the first and second Ig domains of sidekick-1 and -2 are necessary and sufficient to mediate and target homophilic adhesion, and the QLVILA sequence is critical to the interaction. Understanding these functional domains has widespread implications in normal development and HIVAN pathogenesis."

Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin. Our hypothesis was that these parameters might be altered by phosphorylation of threonine 353, which is located near the calcium and triadin/junctin binding sites. Although phosphorylation increased the calcium binding capacity of calsequestrin nearly 2-fold, it did not alter calsequestrin polymerisation, its binding to triadin or junctin or inhibition of ryanodine receptor activity at 1 mM luminal calcium. Phosphorylation was required for calsequestrin binding to junctin when calcium concentration was low (100 nM), and ryanodine receptors were activated by dephosphorylated calsequestrin when it bound to triadin alone. These novel data shows that phosphorylated calsequestrin is required for high capacity calcium buffering and suggest that ryanodine receptor inhibition by calsequestrin is mediated by junctin."

The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, therefore rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be started as soon as possible."

Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) dysfunction caused by hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 and/or partial depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 has been indicated in AF. RyR2 stabilization may prevent SR dysfunction and thereby protect the heart from damage. Hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism and heart failure, three common pathological conditions associated with AF, result in increased SR Ca(2+) leak via RyR2. RyR2 stabilization may prevent SR Ca(2+) leak and thereby prevent AF. Triggered activity appears to underlie atrial ectopic foci, which cause AF. Diastolic Ca(2+) leak from SR via RyR2 may initiate triggered activity. Therefore, modulating RyR2 opening probability would be predicted to protect against triggered activity. Atrial oxidative stress plays a contributing role in the pathogenesis of AF. RyR2 is a target of reactive oxygen species, and chronic RyR2 oxidation increases RyR2 opening probability in a more sustained, less reversible manner. Strategies that attenuate oxidative stress and protect against AF may also contribute to RyR2 stabilization. Finally, KN-3 and JTV519, two compounds that stabilize RyR2 in the closed state, prevent the induction of triggered activity and suppress the inducibility of sustained AF. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that experimental approaches designed to improve RyR2 stabilization will drive a novel conceptual revolution in AF drug development and lead to new clinical investigations."

In response to DNA damage, nuclear FA proteins associate into high molecular weight complexes through a cascade of post-translational modifications and physical interactions, followed by the repair of damaged DNA. Hematopoietic cells are particularly sensitive to the loss of these interactions, and bone marrow failure occurs almost universally in FA patients. FA as a disease is further characterized by cancer susceptibility, which highlights the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression, and will be the focus of this review. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common cancer type, often subsequent to bone marrow failure. However, FA patients are also at an extreme risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck and gynecological tract, with an even greater incidence in those individuals who have received a bone marrow transplant and recovered from hematopoietic disease. FA tumor suppression in hematopoietic versus epithelial compartments could be mechanistically similar or distinct. Definition of compartment specific FA activities is now critical to assess the effects of today's bone marrow failure treatments on tomorrow's solid tumor development. It is our hope that current therapies can then be optimized to decrease the risk of malignant transformation in both hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of the Fanconi anemia pathway as it contributes to stress responses, DNA repair and squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility."

The combination of these approaches revealed the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in the closely related megakaryocyte lineage. Accordingly, Meis1 was significantly upregulated in LSD1 inhibited erythroid cells, but not in megakaryocytes. This lineage specific upregulation in Meis1 expression was accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone3 lysine4 levels in the Meis1 promoter in LSD1 inhibited, erythroid cells. Meis1 was also substantially upregulated in gfi1b-/- fetal liver cells along with its transcriptional partners Pbx1 and several Hox messages. Elevated Meis1 message levels persisted in gfi1b mutant fetal liver cells differentiated along the erythroid lineage, relative to wild type. However, cells differentiated along the megakaryocytic lineage, exhibited no difference in Meis1 levels between controls and mutants. Transfection experiments further demonstrated specific repression of meis1 promoter driven reporters by wild type Gfi1b but neither by a SNAG domain mutant nor by a DNA binding deficient one, thus confirming direct functional regulation of this promoter by the Gfi1b transcriptional complex. Overall, our results demonstrate direct yet differential regulation of meis1 transcription by Gfi1b in distinct hematopoietic lineages thus revealing it to be a common, albeit lineage specific, target of both Gfi1b and its paralog Gfi1."

A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6-thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, whereas another for the DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A) poison etoposide identified TOP2A, as expected, and also cyclin-dependent kinase 6, CDK6. A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes. Last, we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs, enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs. Collectively, these results establish Cas9/sgRNA screens as a powerful tool for systematic genetic analysis in mammalian cells. "

This study aimed to assess the association of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble Klotho with all-cause mortality. We measured soluble Klotho and FGF23 levels at enrolment and two weeks later in 239 prevalent hemodialysis patients. The primary hypothesis was that low Klotho and high FGF23 are associated with increased mortality. The association between Klotho and atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline was explored as secondary outcome. AF was defined as presence of paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF. During a median follow-up of 924 days, 59 (25%) patients died from any cause. Lower Klotho levels were not associated with mortality in a multivariable adjusted analysis when examined either on a continuous scale (HR 1.25 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.84-1.86) or in tertiles, with tertile 1 as the reference category (HR for tertile two 0.65, 95% CI 0.26-1.64; HR for tertile three 2.18, 95% CI 0.91-2.23). Higher Klotho levels were associated with the absence of AF in a muItivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 0.66 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.41-1.00). Higher FGF23 levels were associated with mortality risk in a multivariable adjusted analysis when examined either on a continuous scale (HR 1.45 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.05-1.99) or in tertiles, with the tertile 1 as the reference category (HR for tertile two 1.63, 95% CI 0.64-4.14; HR for tertile three 3.91, 95% CI 1.28-12.20).

In addition to having ancestral roles in digestion and fat solubilization, bile acids have recently been described as signaling molecules involved in many physiological functions, such as glucose and energy metabolisms. These signaling pathways involve the activation of the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR\u03b1) or of the G\u00a0protein-coupled receptor TGR5. In this review, we will focus on the emerging role of FXR\u03b1, suggesting important functions for the receptor in steroid metabolism. It has been described that FXR\u03b1 is expressed in the adrenal glands and testes, where it seems to control steroid production. FXR\u03b1 also participates in steroid catabolism in the liver and interferes with the steroid signaling pathways in target tissues via crosstalk with steroid receptors. In this review, we discuss the potential impacts of bile acid (BA), through its interactions with steroid metabolism, on glucose metabolism, sexual function, and prostate and breast cancers. Although several of the published reports rely on in vitro studies, they highlight the need to understand the interactions that may affect health. This effect is important because BA levels are increased in several pathophysiological conditions related to liver injuries. Additionally, BA receptors are targeted clinically using therapeutics to treat liver diseases, diabetes, and cancers. "

We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. To examine the function of metalloproteinase activity in pituitary cells we used the synthetic MMP inhibitor batimastat. These studies demonstrate that MMPs secreted by pituitary cells can release growth factors anchored to the extracellular matrix that, in turn, control pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion.

Accumulating evidence links vitamin D deficiency with abnormal glucose metabolism, and epidemiological studies have shown that women who develop GDM are more likely to be vitamin D deficient. This review discusses the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of GDM and vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women, outlines the possible mechanism of action of vitamin D in glucose homeostasis, and summarizes emerging evidence that associates vitamin D deficiency with the risk of developing GDM. This critical review of the literature indicates there is a need for intervention trials to test the possible beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with low vitamin D status to reduce the risk of developing GDM."

We analyzed ChIP-Seq peaks of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 silencing proteins and discovered 238 unexpected euchromatic loci that exhibited enrichment of all three. Surprisingly, published ChIP-Seq datasets for the Ste12 transcription factor and the centromeric Cse4 protein indicated that these proteins were also enriched in the same euchromatic regions with the high Sir protein levels. The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. The apparent enrichment of various proteins at hyper-ChIPable loci was not a consequence of artifacts associated with deep sequencing methods, as confirmed by ChIP-quantitative PCR. The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations. ChIP-Seq on chromatin immunoprecipitated with a nuclear-localized GFP reproduced the above enrichment in an expression-dependent manner: induction of the GAL genes resulted in an increased ChIP signal of the GFP protein at these loci, with presumably no biological relevance. Whereas ChIP is a broadly valuable technique, some published conclusions based upon ChIP procedures may merit reevaluation in light of these findings. "

E-cadherin associates with beta-catenin at the membrane-distal region of its cytosolic domain and with p120 at the membrane-proximal region of its cytoplasmic domain. It has been shown that a pool of cell surface E-cadherin is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the surface. Further, p120 knockdown by small interference RNA resulted in dose-dependent elimination of cell surface E-cadherin. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. A dileucine motif in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain is required for E-cadherin endocytosis, because substitution of these residues to alanine resulted in impaired internalization of the protein. The alanine substitutions in the p120-uncoupled construct reduced endocytosis of the protein, indicating that this motif was dominant to p120 binding in the control of E-cadherin endocytosis. Therefore, these results are consistent with the idea that p120 regulates E-cadherin endocytosis by masking the dileucine motif and preventing interactions with adaptor proteins required for internalization."

The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II. As a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA. Physiological barriers to pol II elongation, such as repressive chromatin structure, can thereby similarly impact splicing decisions. Surprisingly, pre-mRNA splicing can reciprocally influence pol II elongation and chromatin structure.

RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response observed in osteosarcoma cells with MDM2 gene amplification. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase activity did not change the kinetics of p53-induced cell death. Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression. Notably, RG7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in LNCaP xenograft tumors. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53."

T3 is known to regulate beta-adrenergic receptor density in the heart but the effects of sympathomimetic drugs on thyroid hormone receptors (T3R) is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate how amiodarone and isoproterenol affect T3R-mRNA in cultured cardiomyocytes. Confluent, isoproterenol pretreated, AT-1 cardiomyocytes were treated with isoproterenol free medium, amiodarone, T3 and amiodarone together with T3 for 48 hours. Solution hybridization for the determination of mRNA for T3R alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2 were performed. In itself isoproterenol upregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, respectively, downregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, added together, upregulated T3R alpha 2 and T3R beta 1 (p < 0.05) as compared to amiodarone or T3 alone. There was an antagonistic effect between amiodarone and T3 for the regulation T3R beta 1. This is the first evidence showing that amiodarone regulates T3R-mRNA concentrations during cathecholamine stress. Isoproterenol regulation of T3R-mRNA levels provides further evidence for the close interaction between the thyroid hormone and the beta-adrenergic systems."

Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that changes in TH may constitute an important component in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In fact, TH seems to be a \"switch\" for the fetal cardiac phenotype. Changes in the TH-thyroid hormone receptor axis are also evident in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired cardiac function and increased mortality. More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics. TH analogs have already been developed and may allow exploitation of the TH-thyroid hormone receptor in clinical practice. At present, the therapeutic potential and efficacy of TH in the treatment of cardiac diseases await evaluation in large clinical trials."

The molecular mechanisms underlying MMR deficiency may be different in IBD CRCs, and in sporadic and hereditary MSI tumors. Here, we hypothesize that overexpression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related microRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD CRCs. We studied miR-155 and miR-21 expression using real-time quantitative PCR in MSI (n = 10) and microsatellite stable (n = 10) IBD CRCs, and in MSI (n = 32) and microsatellite stable (n = 30) non-IBD CRCs. We also screened colonic samples from IBD patients without cancer (n = 18) and used healthy colonic mucosa as controls (n = 20). MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly overexpressed not only in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared with non-IBD controls (P < 0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ratios of expressions in tumors versus matched distant mucosa revealed a nearly significant association between miR-155 overexpression and MSI in IBDs (P = 0.057). These results show a strong deregulation of both MMR-targeting microRNAs in IBD subjects with or without cancer. MiR-155 overexpression being particularly associated to MSI IBD CRCs and extending to distant non-neoplastic mucosa, strongly suggests that a pre-neoplastic miR-155 field defect may promote MSI-driven transformation of the colonic mucosa. The detection and monitoring of miR-155 field defect may, therefore, have implications for the prevention and treatment of MSI IBD CRCs."

Therefore, lowering \u03b1-synuclein levels represents a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD and related synucleinopathies. Here, we report that Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), an enzyme up-regulated in synucleinopathy-diseased brains, interacts with, phosphorylates and enhances \u03b1-synuclein autophagic degradation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. PLK2-mediated degradation of \u03b1-synuclein requires both phosphorylation at S129 and PLK2/\u03b1-synuclein complex formation. In a rat genetic model of PD, PLK2 overexpression reduces intraneuronal human \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, suppresses dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and reverses hemiparkinsonian motor impairments induced by \u03b1-synuclein overexpression. This PLK2-mediated neuroprotective effect is also dependent on PLK2 activity and \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLK2 is a previously undescribed regulator of \u03b1-synuclein turnover and that modulating its kinase activity could be a viable target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.

TSC1 markers showed different maternal and paternal haplotypes in affected children, excluding a mutation in TSC1 as the cause of the disease. For the TSC2 markers all the affected children had the same maternal and paternal haplotypes, as did three of their unaffected siblings. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother. This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism."

Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. We developed a novel assay based on recombination between two Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) sequences in transiently transfected plasmid DNA. The plasmid construct contains an intact, emission-shifted, \"blue\" variant of GFP (BFP), with a 300 nucleotide stretch of homology to a nonfunctional copy of GFP. In the absence of homologous recombination only BFP is present, but homologous recombination can create a functional GFP. The homologous regions in the plasmid were constructed in both the direct and the inverted orientation of transcription to detect possible differences in the recombination mechanisms involved. A panel of human tumor cell lines was chosen on the basis of genetic background and chromosome integrity and tested for homologous recombination using this assay. The panel included cell lines with varying levels of karyotypic abnormalities, isogenic cell lines with normal and mutant p53, isogenic cell lines with or without DNA mismatch repair, BRCA1 and -2 mutant cell lines, and the lymphoma cell line DT40. With this assay, the observed differences between cell lines with the lowest and highest levels of recombination were about 100-fold. Increased levels of recombination were associated with mutant p53, whereas a low level of recombination was found in the BRCA1 mutant cell line. In the cell line HT1080TG, a mutagenized derivative of HT1080 with two mutant alleles of p53, high levels of recombination were found with the direct orientation but not with the inverted orientation plasmid. No difference in recombination was detected between two isogenic cell lines that only differed in DNA mismatch repair capability. We conclude that this assay can detect differences in homologous recombination capacity in cultured cell lines and that these differences follow the patterns that would be expected from the different genotypes of these cell lines. Future application in normal cells may be useful to identify genetic determinants controlling genomic integrity or to detect differences in DNA repair capacity in individuals."

To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. We found that 11% of the conserved noncoding DNA consists of predicted MARs. Conversely, more than half of the predicted MARs co-occur with one or more independently identified conserved sequence blocks. An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5' ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control."

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements \u226580 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.

Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. Among 49 patients with secondary infertility, the spontaneous abortion rate was reduced from 49% to 20% after conservative surgery (P less than or equal to 0.01). Three contemporary classification systems were utilized to categorize patients according to the sites and amount of endometriosis at the time of conservative surgery. Those systems suggested by Buttram (Fertil Steril 30:240, 1978) and by Kistner and coauthors (Fertil Steril 28:108, 1977) revealed differences among fecundability rates among the different categories (P less than or equal to 0.01); however, the system suggested by The American Fertility Society (AFS) (Fertil Steril 32:633, 1979) revealed significant differences only if categories were combined (mild plus moderate versus severe plus extensive, P less than or equal to 0.05). Nevertheless, the AFS system revealed that pregnancy success was significantly reduced if an ovarian endometrioma was greater than 3 cm or had ruptured (P less than or equal to 0.01)."

The patient manifested fetal akinesia, neonatal severe hypotonia with muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, swallowing disturbance, and ophthalomoplegia.

Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response observed in osteosarcoma cells with MDM2 gene amplification. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase activity did not change the kinetics of p53-induced cell death. Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression. Notably, RG7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in LNCaP xenograft tumors. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53."

However, neither the precise positions of CpG islands relative to TSS of genes nor the correlation between the presence of the CpG islands and the expression specificity of these genes is well-understood. Using thousands of sequences with known TSS in human and mouse, we found that there is a clear peak in the distribution of CpG islands around TSS in the genes of these two species. Thus, we classified human (mouse) genes into 6600 (2948) CpG+ genes and 2619 (1830) CpG- ones, based on the presence of a CpG island within the -100: +100 region. We estimated the degree of each gene being a housekeeper by the number of cDNA libraries where its ESTs were detected. Then, the tendency that a gene lacking CpG islands around its TSS is expressed with a higher degree of tissue specificity turned out to be evolutionarily conserved. We also confirmed this tendency by analyzing the gene ontology annotation of classified genes. Since no such clear correlation was found in the control data (mRNAs, pre-mRNAs, and chromosome banding pattern), we concluded that the effect of a CpG island near the TSS should be more important than the global GC content of the region where the gene resides."

She could not eat well while groaning. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration. During expiration, however, the vocal cords adducted, resulting in the involuntary production of voice. Electromyography showed an increase in the activity of the thyroarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles. This muscle activity was further enhanced during inspiration. The involuntary phonation disappeared when the patient's dose of L-dopa was decreased, although she had a decrease in her systemic mobility as well. When the dose of L-dopa was increased to the therapeutic level, involuntary phonation recurred, and her voluntary systemic activity improved. In the present case, it was considered that excessive dopaminergic denervation occurred in the nerve innervating the laryngeal adductors. Involuntary voice appeared to be produced by hypertonus of the laryngeal adductors because of a lowering in the threshold level for L-dopa, even though the drug was administered at the usual dose."

Their conception was improved by the use of new techniques: self-assembled nanofibres, electrospinning, solution-phase separation, micropatterned hydrogels, bioprinting, and rapid prototyping. Cellular biology processes allow us to choose between embryonic stem cells or adult stem cells for regenerative medicine. Finally, communication between cells and their environment is essential; they use various signals to do so. The study of signals and their transmission led to the discovery and the use of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). The development of cellular therapy led to the emergence of a specific field: gene therapy. It relies on viral vectors, which include: retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated vectors (AAV). Non-viral vectors include plasmids and lipoplex. Some BMP genes have successfully been transfected.

In this article, we show not only that CNS sequences can be detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, but also that a subset of 37 CNSs can be found in all flowering plants (diverging \u223c170 million years ago). These CNSs are functionally similar to vertebrate CNEs, being highly associated with transcription factor and development genes and enriched in transcription factor binding sites. Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates.

Herein, we isolated Flk-1(+) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adult adipose tissue and induced them to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells in culture. Within mdx mice, an animal model of DMD, adipose tissue-derived Flk-1(+) MSCs (AD-MSCs) homed to and differentiated into cells that repaired injured muscle tissue. This repair correlated with reconstitution of dystrophin expression on the damaged fibers. Flk-1(+) AD-MSCs also differentiated into muscle satellite cells. This differentiation may have accounted for long-term reconstitution. These cells also differentiated into endothelial cells, thereby possibly improving fiber regeneration as a result of the induced angiogenesis.

The anti-isoniazid convulsant action of FGIN-1-27 and alpidem, but not that of THDOC, is blocked by PK 11195. In contrast, flumazenil blocked completely the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam and zolpidem and partially blocked that of alpidem, but it did not affect the anticonvulsant action of THDOC and FGIN-1-27. Alpidem, like clonazepam, zolpidem and diazepam, but not THDOC or FGIN-1-27, delay the onset of bicuculline-induced convulsions. In two animal models of anxiety, the neophobic behavior in the elevated plus maze test and the conflict-punishment behavior in the Vogel conflict test, THDOC and FGIN-1-27 elicited anxiolytic-like effects in a manner that is flumazenil insensitive, whereas alpidem elicited a similar anxiolytic effect, but is partially blocked by flumazenil. Whereas PK 11195 blocked the effect of FGIN-1-27 and partially blocked alpidem, it did not affect THDOC in both animal models of anxiety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Japanese patients with MDD who had completed an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients received 25 or 50 mg/day desvenlafaxine or placebo were enrolled. In this study, patients received desvenlafaxine 25 mg/day from days 1 to 14, with subsequent upward titration, to a maximum of 100 mg/day, determined by clinical response. Of 304 patients, 75 (24.7%) discontinued during the on-therapy period; patient request was the most common reason (11.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 240 patients (78.9%) during the on-therapy period; the most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (37.2%), somnolence (11.5%), headache (10.5%), and nausea (10.2%). For the ITT-LOCF population, the mean change from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D\u2081\u2087) total score was -4.76 (95% confidence interval: -5.47 to -4.05); continued numerical improvements in the HAM-D\u2081\u2087 total scores and other depression outcome measures were observed irrespective of treatment in the previous study. Long-term use of desvenlafaxine was safe and well tolerated, with a clinical benefit/risk profile similar to that in other populations."

In the presence of functioning erythropoiesis, iron supplementation alone may be adequate to replenish iron stores and restore blood loss. Where hormone replacement with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent is required, iron adequacy will optimize treatment. Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment. The literature indicates that high doses of iron are required, with levels of 1500 mg in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and up to 3600 mg in inflammatory bowel disease. New formulations of intravenous iron have recently been introduced that allow clinicians to administer high doses of iron in a single administration. Ferumoxytol is available in the US, has a maximum dose of 510 mg iron in a single administration, but is limited to use in chronic kidney disease. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indications. The latest introduction is iron isomaltoside 1000. Again, a test dose is not required, and it can be delivered rapidly as an infusion (in an hour), allowing even higher doses of iron to be administered in a single infusion, ie, 20 mg/kg body weight with no ceiling. This will allow clinicians to achieve high-dose repletion more frequently as a single administration. Treatment options for iron repletion have taken a major leap forward in the past two years, especially to meet the demand for high doses given as a single administration."

After follow-up in independent samples, seven loci attained genome-wide significance (GWS), but multi-locus tests suggested some SNPs that did not do so represented true associations. We tested 78 of the 81 SNPs in 2640 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia attending a clozapine clinic (CLOZUK), 2504 cases with a research diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 2878 controls. In CLOZUK, we obtained significant replication to the PGC-associated allele for no fewer than 37 (47%) of the SNPs, including many prior GWS major histocompatibility complex (MHC) SNPs as well as 3/6 non-MHC SNPs for which we had data that were reported as GWS by the PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In bipolar disorder, we also obtained significant evidence for association for 21% of the alleles that had been associated with schizophrenia in the PGC. Our study independently confirms association to three loci previously reported to be GWS in schizophrenia, and identifies the first GWS evidence in schizophrenia for a further three loci. Given the number of independent replications and the power of our sample, we estimate 98% (confidence interval (CI) 78-100%) of the original set of 78 SNPs represent true associations. We also provide strong evidence for overlap in genetic risk between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."

However, we found that the predominantly nuclear A3B only weakly restricted infection by HIV-1, HIV-1\u0394vif, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), while significantly inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition. The chimeric construct A3G/B, in which the first 60 amino acids of A3B were replaced with those of A3G, restricted HIV-1, HIV-1\u0394vif, and HTLV-1 infection, as well as LINE-1 retrotransposition. In contrast to the exclusively cytoplasmic A3G, which is inactive against LINE-1 retrotransposition, the A3G/B protein, while localized mainly to the cytoplasm, was also present in the nucleus. Further mutational analysis revealed that residues 18, 19, 22, and 24 in A3B were the major determinants for nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization and antiretroviral activity. HIV-1\u0394vif packages A3G, A3B, and A3G/B into particles with close-to-equal efficiencies. Mutation E68Q or E255Q in the active centers of A3G/B resulted in loss of the inhibitory activity against HIV-1\u0394vif, while not affecting activity against LINE-1 retrotransposition. The low inhibition of HIV-1\u0394vif by A3B correlated with a low rate of G-to-A hypermutation. In contrast, viruses that had been exposed to A3G/B showed a high number of G-to-A transitions. The mutation pattern was similar to that previously reported for A3B, with a preference for the GA context. In summary, these observations suggest that changing 4 residues in the amino terminus of A3B not only retargets the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but also enhances its ability to restrict HIV while retaining inhibition of retrotransposition."

We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes. The RARG locus, frequently interacting with the POU5F1 locus, has abundant RAD21 binding sites co-localized with other protein binding sites. Thus the interactomes of these two pluripotency genes could be an important part of the regulatory network in hESCs."

Here, we identify EZH2 as a target of the MYC oncogene in prostate cancer and show that MYC coordinately regulates EZH2 through transcriptional and post-transcriptional means.  Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN.  We report that upregulation of Myc in the mouse prostate results in overexpression of EZH2 mRNA and protein which coincides with reductions in miR-26a and miR-26b, known regulators of EZH2 in some non-prostate cell types, albeit not in others.  Further, in human prostate cancer cells, Myc negatively regulates miR-26a and miR-26b via direct binding to their parental Pol II gene promoters, and forced overexpression of miR-26a and miR-26b in prostate cancer cells results in decreased EZH2 levels and suppressed proliferation. In human clinical samples, miR-26a and miR-26b are downregulated in most primary prostate cancers.  As a separate mechanism of EZH2 mRNA upregulation, we find that Myc binds directly to and activates the transcription of the EZH2 promoter. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. Further, the results implicate EZH2-driven mechanisms by which Myc may stimulate prostate tumor initiation and disease progression."

In the present study, we have investigated cross-talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways using preadipocytes with and without knockdown of the Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 and with and without knock-out of insulin and IGF-1 receptors. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3\u03b2, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. These Wnt effects are insulin/IGF-1 receptor-dependent and are lost in insulin/IGF-1 receptor double knock-out cells. Conversely, in LRP5 knockdown preadipocytes, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS1, Akt, GSK3\u03b2, and ERK1/2 is highly reduced. This effect is specific to insulin, as compared with IGF-1, stimulation and appears to be due to an inducible interaction between LRP5 and the insulin receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These data demonstrate that Wnt and insulin signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk at multiple levels. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3\u03b2, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Insulin signaling also involves the Wnt co-receptor LRP5, which has a positive effect on insulin signaling. Thus, altered Wnt and LRP5 activity can serve as modifiers of insulin action and insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of diabetes and metabolic syndrome."

Employing an artificially constructed DNA in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was placed under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, we analyzed the induction process in HeLa cells and found that inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppressed UV-induced HIV-1 gene expression but not tat-mediated expression. We also found that suppression occurs at the posttranscriptional level. These results indicate that HIV-1 gene expression is activated by at least two different mechanisms, one of which involves poly-ADP ribosylation. A possible new role of poly-ADP ribosylation in the regulation of specific gene expression is also discussed."

Historically, the treatment for advanced DTC is challenging after patients become refractory to radioactive iodine. The response to doxorubicin, the only chemotherapy agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is disappointing either as monotherapy or combination therapy. Because of the lack of effective systemic treatment coupled with increased understanding of molecular and cellular pathogenesis, multiple kinase inhibitors (MKIs) as an alternative therapy for the treatment of advanced DTC has generated much interest, enthusiasm, and, most excitingly, promising results. After the encouraging results of these agents in earlier trials, the Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib for the treatment of locally recurrent, progressive, or metastatic DTC refractory to radioactive iodine treatment based on the results of a multicenter DECISION trial. Sorafenib therefore became the first MKI approved for this indication in more than 20 years. However, even more impressive responses and progression-free survival benefits were seen in the phase III SELECT trial with lenvatinib, giving even higher hopes for the future management of what was considered just a decade ago an orphan disease. Given the role of MKIs, a new era in the treatment of advanced DTC has begun. We review the key therapeutic targets, oncogenic pathways, and promising clinical results of these agents in refractory disease, as well as their roles after failure of first line kinase inhibitors.

In the present study, we explored the effect of curcumin, a phytochemical, on HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1 and HDAC6 in two different leukemia cell lines (K-562 and HL-60). The association between HDAC6, HSPs, and intrinsic oxidative stress was also investigated. Overexpression of HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1, and HDAC6 in leukemia cells were down-regulated by curcumin, and the effects on HSPs 27and 70 were less than that on HSP 90. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, leading to apoptosis. Different cell cycle regulatory proteins (p53, p21, cyclin B1, CDK1, Cdc25C) and some apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, Bad, Apaf1, AIF and Cyt c) were altered by curcumin. Increased ROS levels in leukemia cells were quenched by curcumin. A probable association between high ROS level and the overexpression of the tumor markers was established in this study.

Patients with FA exhibit a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical features. The most significant and consistent phenotypic characteristics are stem cell loss, causing progressive bone marrow failure and sterility, diverse developmental abnormalities and a profound predisposition to neoplasia. To date, 15 genes have been identified, biallelic disruption of any one of which results in this clinically defined syndrome. It is now apparent that all 15 gene products act in a common process to maintain genome stability. At the molecular level, a fundamental defect in DNA repair underlies this complex phenotype. Cells derived from FA patients spontaneously accumulate broken chromosomes and exhibit a marked sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Despite complementation analysis defining many components of the FA DNA repair pathway, no direct link to DNA metabolism was established until recently. First, it is now evident that the FA pathway is required to make incisions at the site of damaged DNA. Second, a specific component of the FA pathway has been identified that regulates nucleases previously implicated in DNA interstrand crosslink repair. Taken together, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the FA pathway is a bona fide DNA repair pathway that directly mediates DNA repair transactions, thereby elucidating the specific molecular defect in human Fanconi anaemia."

Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation."

In the present study we investigated the role of TNNI3K in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. Pluripotent P19CL6 cells with or without transfection by pcDNA6-TNNI3K plasmid were used to induce differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes. TNNI3K promoted the differentiation process, judging from the increasing beating mass and increased number of alpha-actinin-positive cells. TNNI3K improved cardiac function by enhancing beating frequency and increasing the contractile force and epinephrine response of spontaneous action potentials without an increase of the single-cell size. TNNI3K suppressed phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I, annexin-V(+) cells, Bax protein, and p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Intramyocardial administration of TNNI3K-overexpressing P19CL6 cells in mice with myocardial infarction improved cardiac performance and attenuated ventricular remodeling compared with injection of wild-type P19CL6 cells. In conclusion, our study clearly indicates that TNNI3K promotes cardiomyogenesis, enhances cardiac performance, and protects the myocardium from ischemic injury by suppressing p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, modulation of TNNI3K activity would be a useful therapeutic approach for ischemic cardiac disease."

Recently emerging optogenetic technique has been proposed as an alternative approach to control such seizures but whether it may be effective in situations where inhibitory processes in the brain are compromised has not been addressed. Here we used pharmacological and optogenetic techniques to block inhibitory neurotransmission and induce epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that NpHR-based optogenetic hyperpolarization and thereby inactivation of a principal neuronal population in the hippocampus is effectively attenuating seizure activity caused by disconnected network inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that epileptiform activity in the hippocampus caused by impaired inhibition may be controlled by optogenetic silencing of principal neurons and potentially can be developed as an alternative treatment for epilepsy.

In vertebrates, the genes that orchestrate embryonic patterning are in part regulated by highly conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), yet these elements have not been identified in urochordate genomes. Consequently the evolution of the cis-regulatory code for urochordate development remains largely uncharacterised. Here, we use genome-wide comparisons between C. intestinalis and C. savignyi to identify putative urochordate cis-regulatory sequences. Ciona conserved non-coding elements (ciCNEs) are associated with largely the same key regulatory genes as vertebrate CNEs. Furthermore, some of the tested ciCNEs are able to activate reporter gene expression in both zebrafish and Ciona embryos, in a pattern that at least partially overlaps that of the gene they associate with, despite the absence of sequence identity. We also show that the ability of a ciCNE to up-regulate gene expression in vertebrate embryos can in some cases be localised to short sub-sequences, suggesting that functional cross-talk may be defined by small regions of ancestral regulatory logic, although functional sub-sequences may also be dispersed across the whole element. We conclude that the structure and organisation of cis-regulatory modules is very different between vertebrates and urochordates, reflecting their separate evolutionary histories. However, functional cross-talk still exists because the same repertoire of transcription factors has likely guided their parallel evolution, exploiting similar sets of binding sites but in different combinations.

Cardiac-specific overexpression of MED13 or pharmacologic inhibition of miR-208a in mice confers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Conversely, genetic deletion of MED13 specifically in cardiomyocytes enhances obesity in response to high-fat diet and exacerbates metabolic syndrome. The metabolic actions of MED13 result from increased energy expenditure and regulation of numerous genes involved in energy balance in the heart. These findings reveal a role of the heart in systemic metabolic control and point to MED13 and miR-208a as potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders."

However, while investigating the ephrinA1/EphA2 system in the pathobiology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we uncovered that ephrinA1 is released from GBM and breast adenocarcinoma cells as a soluble, monomeric protein and is a functional form of the ligand in this state. Conditioned media containing a soluble monomer of ephrinA1 caused EphA2 internalization and downregulation, dramatic alteration of cell morphology and suppression of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Moreover, soluble monomeric ephrinA1 was functional in a physiological context, eliciting collapse of embryonic neuronal growth cones. We also found that ephrinA1 is cleaved from the plasma membrane of GBM cells, an event which involves the action of a metalloprotease. Thus, the ephrinA1 ligand can, indeed, function as a soluble monomer and may act in a paracrine manner on the EphA2 receptor without the need for juxtacrine interactions. These findings have important implications for further deciphering the function of these proteins in pathology and physiology, as well as for the design of ephrinA1-based EphA2-targeted antitumor therapeutics."

However, the location of replication origins (oriCs) in many sequenced archaeal genomes remains unknown. We present a web-based tool Ori-Finder 2 to predict oriCs in the archaeal genomes automatically, based on the integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the Z-curve method, the distribution of origin recognition boxes identified by FIMO tool, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriCs. The web server is also able to analyze the unannotated genome sequences by integrating with gene prediction pipelines and BLAST software for gene identification and function annotation. The result of the predicted oriCs is displayed as an HTML table, which offers an intuitive way to browse the result in graphical and tabular form. The software presented here is accurate for the genomes with single oriC, but it does not necessarily find all the origins of replication for the genomes with multiple oriCs. Ori-Finder 2 aims to become a useful platform for the identification and analysis of oriCs in the archaeal genomes, which would provide insight into the replication mechanisms in archaea.

We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms triggered by the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation using primary osteoblasts (POB) prepared from aly/aly mice. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization induced by the presence of \u03b2-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid were enhanced in POB from aly/aly compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, osteoblastic differentiation induced by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), as shown by ALP activity, mRNA expression of osteocalcin, Id1, Osterix and Runx2, and Sma- and Mad-related protein (Smad)1/5/8 phosphorylation, was also enhanced in POB from aly/aly mice. The ectopic bone formation in vivo that was induced by BMP2 was enhanced in aly/aly mice compared with controls. Transfection of a mutant form of p100, p100\u0394GRR, which cannot be processed to p52, stimulated ALP activity and Smad phosphorylation. In contrast to p100\u0394GRR, overexpression of p52 inhibited these events. Both BMP2-induced ALP activity and Smad phosphorylation were reduced in POB from p100-deficient mice, which carry a homozygous deletion of the COOH-terminal ankyrin repeats of p100 but still express functional p52 protein. p52 and p100\u0394GRR interacted with a BMP receptor, ALK2, in overexpressed COS7 cells and changed the ALK2 protein levels in opposite directions: p52 reduced ALK2 and p100 increased it. Thus, the alternative the NF-\u03baB pathway via the processing of p52 from p100 negatively regulates osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation by modifying BMP activity."

We show that indels are the most frequent elementary events and that they occur in most cases at either the N- or C-terminus of the proteins. As revealed by the genomic neighbourhood/context of the corresponding genes, we show that a substantial number of these terminal indels are the consequence of gene fusions/fissions. We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins."

We now show that Fbxw7 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes by mediating the degradation of c-Myc and Notch proteins. Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes showed an increased proliferative capacity that was dependent on the accumulation of c-Myc but not on that of Notch. Fbxw7 deficiency also resulted in the premature differentiation of keratinocytes in a manner dependent on both c-Myc and Notch. Although Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes proliferated excessively in vitro, loss of Fbxw7 did not predispose keratinocytes to the formation of squamous cell carcinoma in vivo induced by the expression of oncogenic Ras, possibly because the stem cell population of keratinocytes becomes exhausted as a result of enhanced Notch activity. Indeed, suppression of Notch signaling by additional ablation of RBP-J in Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes conferred a more aggressive tumorigenic capacity. Collectively, these results indicate that Fbxw7 controls the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, and that it exerts both inhibitory and stimulatory actions in skin carcinogenesis by counteracting the proliferation-promoting effect of c-Myc and the tumor-suppressive effect of Notch, respectively."

In the present study, a fluid-structure interaction analysis was conducted by using the finite element (FE) analysis technique based on the CAD-based computer model of the female pelvis to investigate the urine leakage in females during jumping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fluid-structure interaction FE analysis approach in understanding the mechanisms of SUI in females. Through a series of computer simulations, the effects of varying impact forces determined by jumping height and bladder volume were investigated. The dynamic computer simulation results revealed that jumping heights have a significant influence on the volume of urine leakage caused by the landing impact of jumping. Bladder volume did not have a significant influence on leakage when the jumping heights were smaller than 1 ft, which indicates that normal walking (corresponds to a jumping height smaller than 0.1 ft) is not the primary cause of urine leakage for healthy females. The computer simulation results also showed that the deformation difference between the anterior and posterior portion of the female pelvis causes opening of the urethra and resultant urine leakage. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of using a computer modeling approach to study female SUI during physical and daily activities."

We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the \"re-wiring\" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution.

Nevertheless, the role of CYLD in the function of specific types of immune cells remains elusive. In this report we have used conditional gene targeting in mice to address the role of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD in the myelomonocytic lineage. Truncation of the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD specifically in myelomonocytic cells impaired the development of lethal LPS-induced endotoxic shock and the accumulation of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Our data establish CYLD as a regulator of monocyte-macrophage activation in response to inflammatory stimuli and identify it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in relevant inflammatory disorders in humans."

Junctin and triadin exhibit 60% to 70% amino acid homology in their transmembrane domains, including repeated KEKE motifs important for macromolecular protein-protein interactions within their SR luminal tails. Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. More specifically, both in vitro adenoviral gene transfer and in vivo gene-targeting techniques to manipulate JCN expression levels have shown that JCN is an essential factor in maintaining normal cardiac Ca handling and cardiac function. This article reviews the new findings on the regulatory roles of JCN in cardiac SR Ca cycling and contractility, with special emphasis on the effects of JCN ablation on delayed after depolarization-induced arrhythmias and premature mortality in mouse models."

In contrast to traditional DNA-based tests that largely focus on single genes associated with rare conditions, microarray-based tests are ideal for the study of diseases with underlying complex genetic causes. Several microarray based tests have been translated into clinical practice such as MammaPrint and AmpliChip CYP450. Additional cancer-related microarray-based tests are either in the process of FDA review or under active development, including Tissue of Tumor Origin and AmpliChip p53. All diagnostic microarray testing is ordered by physicians and tested by a Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendment-certified (CLIA) reference laboratory. Recently, companies offering consumer based microarray testing have emerged. Individuals can order tests online and service providers deliver the results directly to the clients via a password-protected secure website. Navigenics, 23andMe and deCODE Genetics represent pioneering companies in this field. Although the progress of these microarray-based tests is extremely encouraging with the potential to revolutionize the recognition and treatment of common diseases, these tests are still in their infancy and face technical, clinical and marketing challenges. In this article, we review microarray-based tests which are currently approved or under review by the FDA, as well as the consumer-based testing. We also provide a summary of the challenges and strategic solutions in the development and clinical use of the microarray-based tests. Finally, we present a brief outlook for the future of microarray-based clinical applications."

Whereas HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells display sustained cell cycle arrest, BV173 leukemia cells undergo rapid apoptosis and other cell lines show an intermediate response. We found that the expression of the p53 target genes p21, 14-3-3sigma and the microRNA miR-34a correlates tightly with the cell fate choice adopted. All three genes were strongly induced in arresting cells, but silenced in cells undergoing Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. In contrast, key apoptotic p53 target genes were equally expressed in arresting and apoptotic cells. Interestingly, we establish that miR-34a cooperates with p21 and 14-3-3sigma to override the apoptotic signals generated by p53 activation. Strikingly, p53 binding to chromatin and p53-mediated recruitment of certain coactivators to all three target loci does not vary among cell types. Instead, the cell type-specific silencing of these genes is due to enhanced p21 mRNA degradation, 14-3-3sigma promoter DNA methylation and reduced processing of the miR-34a primary transcript. Thus, p53-independent events regulating expression of protein-coding genes and microRNAs within the network can define the cellular outcome of p53 activation."

We have identified several sites of significant enrichment for both complexes distributed throughout the previously identified initiation zone. Analysis of the frequency of initiations across stretched DNA fibers from the DHFR locus confirmed a broad zone of de-localized initiation activity surrounding the sites of ORC and MCM enrichment. Mapping positions of mononucleosomal DNA empirically and computing nucleosome-positioning information in silico revealed that ORC and MCM map to regions of low measured and predicted nucleosome occupancy. Our results demonstrate that specific sites of ORC and MCM enrichment can be detected within a mammalian initiation zone, and suggest that initiation zones may be regions of generally low nucleosome occupancy where flexible nucleosome positioning permits flexible pre-RC assembly sites."

ANP decreases endothelial permeability in coronary endothelial cell monolayers. We tested the hypothesis that part of this effect might be mediated by the ANP-C receptor. We used an endothelial cell monolayer from rat coronary endothelium and measured albumin flux. We applied either ANP or a ring-deleted ANP (C-ANP), which only stimulates the ANP-C receptor. ANP and C-ANP both decreased permeability from 100 pM to 100 nM by 60 and 30%, respectively. ANP increased endothelial cGMP contents 5.5-fold, whereas C-ANP had no effect. ANP reduced endothelial cAMP contents by 75%, which was only partly blocked by pertussis toxin. C-ANP also reduced cAMP; however, this effect was completely blocked by pertussis toxin. Protein kinase G inhibition blocked the ANP-mediated decrease in permeability by 50%. In contrast, pretreatment with pertussis toxin, in the face of protein kinase G inhibition, blocked the effect completely. C-ANP decreased permeability by half the amount of ANP. This C-ANP effect was completely blocked by pertussis toxin but not by protein kinase G inhibition. Isoproterenol (10 microM) increased permeability by almost 50%, which was completely blocked by ANP but only partially blocked by C-ANP. The C-ANP effect was blocked completely by pertussis toxin. Isoproterenol increased cAMP threefold, which was abolished by ANP. C-ANP reduced the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP by 50%. Isoproterenol had no effect on cGMP. We conclude that agonist binding to the ANP-C receptor inhibits cAMP production via a Gi protein-coupled signaling system. This inhibition may contribute to the decreased endothelial permeability evoked by ANP in this system."

Using longitudinal samples taken from a closed population of Acrocephalus sechellensis (Seychelles warblers) studied for over 20 years, we describe the first study into life-long adult telomere dynamics (1-17 years) and their relationship to mortality under natural conditions (n = 204 individuals). We show that telomeres shorten with increasing age and body mass, and that shorter telomeres and greater rates of telomere shortening predicted future mortality. Our results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions."

Transfection of exogenous caspase-6 into the clone reversed this phenotype. Lamins A and C, which are caspase-6-only substrates, were cleaved by the wild-type and heterozygous apoptotic extracts but not by the extracts lacking caspase-6. Furthermore, the caspase-6 inhibitor z-VEID-fmk mimicked the effects of caspase-6 deficiency and prevented the cleavage of lamin A.

The structurally unrelated T7 RNAP terminates at a similar type of signal (T\u03a6), suggesting a common mechanism for termination. In the absence of a hairpin (passive conditions), T7 RNAP slips efficiently in both homopolymeric A and U tracts, and we have found that replacement of the U tract in T\u03a6 with a slippage-prone A tract still allows efficient termination. Under passive conditions, incorporation of a single G residue following a poly(U) tract (which is the situation during termination at T\u03a6) results in a \"locked\" complex that is unable to extend the transcript. Our results support a model in which transmission of the shearing force generated by steric clash of the hairpin with the exit pore is promoted by the presence of a slippery tracts downstream, resulting in alterations in the active site and the formation of a locked complex that represents an early step in the termination pathway.

It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes. At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability."

                    "context": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are growing contributors to global disease burdens, with epidemics of CVD advancing across many regions of the world which are experiencing a rapid health transition. Diet and nutrition have been extensively investigated as risk factors for major cardiovascular diseases like coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke and are also linked to other cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. The interpretation of evidence needs to involve a critical appraisal of methodological issues related to measurement of exposures, nature of outcome variables, types of research design and careful separation of cause, consequence and confounding as the basis for observed associations. Adequate evidence is available, from studies conducted within and across populations, to link several nutrients, minerals, food groups and dietary patterns with an increased or decreased risk of CVD. Dietary fats associated with an increased risk of CHD include trans-fats and saturated fats, while polyunsaturated fats are known to be protective. Dietary sodium is associated with elevation of blood pressure, while dietary potassium lowers the risk of hypertension and stroke. Regular frequent intake of fruits and vegetables is protective against hypertension, CHD and stroke. Composite diets (such as DASH diets, Mediterranean diet, 'prudent' diet) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypertension and CHD. Sufficient knowledge exists to recommend nutritional interventions, at both population and individual levels, to reduce cardiovascular risk. That knowledge should now be translated into policies which promote healthy diets and discourage unhealthy diets. This requires coordinated action at the level of governments, international organizations, civil society and responsible sections of the food industry."

Epidemiological data allow assessment of familial environmental risk factors related to western lifestyle, diet, bacteria, and domestic hygiene. All findings point to refrigeration as a potential risk factor for Crohn's disease. Furthermore, cold-chain development paralleled the outbreak of Crohn's disease during the 20th century. The cold chain hypothesis suggests that psychrotrophic bacteria such as Yersinia spp and Listeria spp contribute to the disease. These bacteria have been identified in Crohn's disease lesions and we discuss their pathogenic properties with respect to our knowledge of the disease. From a molecular perspective, we postulate that the disease is a result of a defect in host recognition by pathogenic bacterial components that usually escape the immune response (eg, Yop molecules), which results in an excessive host response to these bacteria."

Although hundreds of UCEs have been found in animal genomes, little is known about the incidence of ultraconservation in plant genomes. Using an alignment-free information-retrieval approach, we have comprehensively identified all long identical multispecies elements (LIMEs), which include both syntenic and nonsyntenic regions, of at least 100 identical base pairs shared by at least two genomes. Among six animal genomes, we found the previously known syntenic UCEs as well as previously undescribed nonsyntenic elements. In contrast, among six plant genomes, we only found nonsyntenic LIMEs. LIMEs can also be classified as either simple (repetitive) or complex (nonrepetitive), they may occur in multiple copies in a genome, and they are often spread across multiple chromosomes. Although complex LIMEs were found in both animal and plant genomes, they differed significantly in their composition and copy number. Further analyses of plant LIMEs revealed their functional diversity, encompassing elements found near rRNA and enzyme-coding genes, as well as those found in transposons and noncoding DNA. We conclude that despite the common presence of LIMEs in both animal and plant lineages, the evolutionary processes involved in the creation and maintenance of these elements differ in the two groups and are likely attributable to several mechanisms, including transfer of genetic material from organellar to nuclear genomes, de novo sequence manufacturing, and purifying selection."

By measuring the amount of tetracycline which became incorporated at different times after an incisor was shortened, it was possible to investigate an early stage of the response of the incisor to cutting. A significant increase in the capacity of the tooth to incorporate tetracycline was detectable 4 h after shortening the tooth, and this was maximal after another 4 h."

LQTS is marked by QT prolongation, syncope and sudden death due to torsades de pointes. Risk stratification is based on age, gender, history of symptoms, QT interval, and genetic subtype of LQTS. In addition to avoidance QT-prolonging drugs and high intensity sports, standard treatment for LQTS involves anti-adrenergic therapy, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use in high risk subgroups. Brugada Syndrome is associated with right ventricular conduction delay and ST elevation in the right precordial leads, syncope, and sudden death from ventricular fibrillation. The electrocardiographic abnormality can be accentuated by sodium channel blocker, vagal stimulation or fever. Patients with aborted cardiac arrest and those with syncope and a spontaneous or sodium channel blocker-inducible type I Brugada ECG pattern are at high risk and should receive an ICD. The role of electrophysiologic testing is controversial. Although there is no reliable drug therapy for Brugada Syndrome, quinidine, which suppresses I(to) current, can reduce the incidence of arrhythmias. Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. Exercise or isoproterenol infusion may cause increased ventricular ectopy or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Treatment modalities include anti-adrenergic therapy and ICD implantation. Congenital SQTS is a relatively recently described disorder characterized by a very short QT interval and by susceptibility to atrial and ventricular fibrillation. ICD implantation is the primary therapy; quinidine may be a useful adjunctive therapy."

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP-1), another member of the LDLR family and a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional cell surface receptor, modulates M1\u2192M2 conversion in murine macrophages. We investigate bone marrow or peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild-type C57/Bl6 mice or mice with conditional inactivation of the LRP-1 gene in the myeloid lineage for the expression of polarization markers. Our results suggest that the deficiency of LRP-1 down-regulates M2 marker expression in macrophages, while enhancing the macrophage response to M1 stimuli. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that LRP-1 affects macrophage polarization and promotes the development of an anti-inflammatory M2 functional phenotype. "

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting. Accordingly, we investigated the anticancer activity of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, in athymic mice injected with highly tumorigenic LNM35 human lung cells as xenografts. Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088). There were no undesirable effects of captopril treatment on animal behavior and body weight. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer."

Our analyses suggest that (i) genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands; (ii) genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands; (iii) there is a balancing force that tends to keep genes from all moving to the leading and more efficient strand and (iv) the percentage of leading-strand genes in an bacterium can be accurately explained based on the numbers of genes in the functional categories outlined in (i) and (ii), genome size and gene density, indicating that these numbers implicitly contain the information about the percentage of genes on the leading versus lagging strand in a genome."

This polypeptide composition and the unusual structure of Lsm11, which plays a role in histone RNA processing, represent new themes in the biology of Sm/Lsm proteins. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively.

We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol. Tissue samples of treated and untreated mSOD mice were analysed for AChE and ChAT enzyme activities as markers of neuromuscular function. Sections of hindlimb muscles (TA, EDL and soleus) were also stained for succinate dehydrogenase and silver cholinesterase activities as well as for immunohistochemistry. Hsp70 levels were also measured from muscle samples using ELISA. Results showed that denervation and nerve sprouting were present at symptom onset in fast muscles, although slow muscles remained fully innervated. Cholinergic enzyme activities were reduced prior to denervation and declined further with disease progression. Reduction of endplate size, a slow to fast shift in muscle phenotype was also observed. Treatment with arimoclomol delayed the appearance of these changes, increased innervation, cholinergic enzyme activities and endplate size and reversed muscle fibre transformation. These beneficial effects of arimoclomol in muscles were accompanied by an increase in Hsp70 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that pharmacological targeting of muscles at early stages of disease may be a successful strategy to ameliorate disease progression in ALS."

We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages. "

After acute coronary artery ligation, a single-lead electrocardiogram was continuously recorded for 24 h and episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation as well as mortality rates were analysed. Monophasic action potential recordings were obtained from the left ventricular epicardium at baseline and 24 h post-myocardial infarction. Thyroid hormones and catecholamines were measured using radioimmunoassay. Thyroid function was similar in the 3 groups. Compared to controls, amiodarone and dronedarone equally decreased the number of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes by approximately 75%. Both agents prevented the increase in monophasic action potential duration and in beat-to-beat variation. Norepinephrine levels were lower only after amiodarone treatment. Despite the observed antiarrhythmic effect, total mortality did not differ between groups (38.8% in controls, 30.0% in the amiodarone group and 58.8% in the dronedarone group), because of excess bradyarrhythmic mortality in both drug groups that reached significance in the dronedarone group. Dronedarone and amiodarone display similar antiarrhythmic efficacy post-myocardial infarction, partly by preventing repolarization inhomogeneity. However, dronedarone increases bradyarrhythmic mortality possibly secondary to its negative inotropic effects."

Functional regions show lower SNP density than other regions in lincRNAs. We revealed that lincRNAs with higher expression levels and broader expression spectrum have significantly lower SNP density. Moreover, we identified lincRNAs that are under recent positive selection and revealed that these lincRNAs show distinct SNP density, expression level, and tissue specificity. Importantly, we identified a genetic variant (rs7990916:T>C) under recent positive selection at a brain-specific lincRNA that significantly affects the structure of normal brain. Analysis of brain magnetic resonance images showed that individuals with CC genotype have significant bigger regional gray matter volume than individuals with TT genotype.

The main aim of our study was to test whether an early and sustained normalization of L-T3 serum levels after MI exerts myocardial protective effects through a mitochondrial preservation. Seventy-two hours after MI induced by anterior interventricular artery ligation, rats were infused with synthetic L-T3 (1.2 \u03bcg/kg/day) or saline over 4 weeks. Compared to saline, L-T3 infusion restored FT3 serum levels at euthyroid state (3.0 \u00b1 0.2 versus 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 pg/ml), improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (39.5 \u00b1 2.5 versus 65.5 \u00b1 6.9%), preserved LV end-systolic wall thickening in the peri-infarct zone (6.34 \u00b1 3.1 versus 33.7 \u00b1 6.21%) and reduced LV infarct-scar size by approximately 50% (all P < 0.05). Moreover, L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. Finally, L-T3 significantly increased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1\u03b1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, in the LV peri-infarct zone. To further explore mechanisms of L-T3 protective effects, we exposed isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes to H(2)O(2) and found that L-T3 rescued mitochondrial biogenesis and function and protected against cell death via a mitoKATP dependent pathway. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection."

Residing in the SR lumen, HRC binds Ca(2+) with high capacity but low affinity. In vitro phosphorylation of HRC affects ryanodine affinity of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), suggesting a functional role of HRC on SR Ca(2+)-release. Indeed, acute HRC overexpression in isolated rodent cardiomyocytes decreases Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release, increases SR Ca(2+)-load, and impairs contractility. The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. However, HRC also affects the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, as shown by HRC overexpression in transgenic mouse hearts, which resulted in reduced SR Ca(2+)-uptake rates, cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. In fact, in vitro generated evidence suggests that HRC directly interacts with SR Ca(2+)-ATPase2, supporting a dual role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis: regulation of both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-release. Furthermore, HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology."

We report a cost-effective extraction methodology permitting quantitative proteomic analyses of small amounts of FFPE tissue for biomarker investigation. This surfactant/heat-based approach results in effective and reproducible protein extraction in FFPE tissue blocks. In combination with a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics methodology, the protocol enables the robust representative and quantitative analyses of the archival proteome. Preliminary validation studies in renal cancer tissues have identified typically 250-300 proteins per 500 ng of tissue with 1D LC-MS/MS with comparable extraction in FFPE and fresh frozen tissue blocks and preservation of tumor/normal differential expression patterns (205 proteins, r = 0.682; p < 10(-15)). The initial methodology presented here provides a quantitative approach for assessing the potential suitability of the vast FFPE tissue archives as an alternate resource for biomarker discovery and will allow exploration of methods to increase depth of coverage and investigate the impact of preanalytical factors."

Subsequent evaluations confirmed total colonic aganglionosis. Because we were unable to safely extubate the infant, a diagnosis of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) was considered and confirmed by molecular analysis of the PHOX2B gene, revealing a heterozygous polyalanine repeat-expansion mutation containing 27 repeats (normal gene contains 20 repeats).

HuR inhibits the association of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor 65 kDa (U2AF65) with the upstream 3' splice site, without decreasing recognition of the downstream 5' splice site by U1 snRNP but by antagonizing the role of TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen 1)/TIAR (TIA-1 related protein) on exon definition. Remarkably, U1 snRNP-mediated recognition of the 5' splice site is partially required for efficient U2AF65 inhibition. Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains. Taken together, these results support a functional link between HuR as repressor of alternative Fas splicing and the molecular mechanisms modulating programmed cell death."

These would centre the A-band in the sarcomere and provide structural continuity in relaxed myofibrils. The A-band region of titin seems to be bound to the thick filament, where it has been proposed to act as a 'molecular ruler' regulating filament length and assembly. Here, we show that partial titin complementary DNAs encode a regular pattern of two types of 100-residue motif, each of which probably folds into a separate domain type.

Since it has been proposed that the Ser/Thr residues on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), we examined the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on PLN function in rat adult cardiomyocytes. Studies using enzymatic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation of wild type and a series of mutants of PLN showed that PLN was O-GlcNAcylated and Ser(16) of PLN might be the site for O-GlcNAcylation. In cardiomyocytes treated with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), the O-GlcNAcylation was significantly increased compared to non-treated cells. Simultaneously, Ser(16)-phosphorylation of PLN was reduced. In Chinese hamster ovary cells where PLN cDNA and O-GlcNAc transferase siRNA were co-transfected, the Ser(16)-phosphorylation of PLN was significantly increased compared to controls. The same results were observed in heart homogenates from diabetic rats. In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes. Unlike non-treated cells, the activity of SERCA2a and the profiles of calcium transients in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes were not significantly changed even after treatment with catecholamine. These data suggest that PLN is O-GlcNAcylated to induce the inhibition of its phosphorylation, which correlates to the deterioration of cardiac function. This might define a novel mechanism by which PLN regulation of SERCA2a is altered under conditions where O-GlcNAcylation is increased, such as those occurring in diabetes."

Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (CEBP\u03b1). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis.

Progress toward clinical use of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors has, however, been hampered due to mechanism-based adverse events, primarily related to impairment of Notch signaling. The \u03b3-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 represents an exception as it is largely tolerable in vivo despite displaying only a small selectivity between A\u03b2 production and Notch signaling in vitro. In exploring the molecular basis for the observed tolerability, we show that MRK-560 displays a strong preference for the presenilin 1 (PS1) over PS2 subclass of \u03b3-secretases and is tolerable in wild-type mice but causes dose-dependent Notch-related side effect in PS2-deficient mice at drug exposure levels resulting in a substantial decrease in brain A\u03b2 levels. This demonstrates that PS2 plays an important role in mediating essential Notch signaling in several peripheral organs during pharmacological inhibition of PS1 and provide preclinical in vivo proof of concept for PS2-sparing inhibition as a novel, tolerable and efficacious \u03b3-secretase targeting strategy for AD."

Receptor knockout (KO) mice offer an opportunity to identify receptors that contribute to a drug-induced effect. Here we examined the effects of modafinil on exploration in C57BL/6J mice, in dopamine drd1, drd2, drd3, and drd4 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and KO mice, and in 129/SJ mice pretreated with the drd1 antagonist SCH23390 using a cross-species test paradigm based on the behavioral pattern monitor. Modafinil increased activity, specific exploration (rearing), and the smoothness of locomotor paths (reduced spatial d) in C57BL/6J and 129/SJ mice (increased holepoking was also observed in these mice). These behavioral profiles are similar to that produced by the dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909. Modafinil was ineffective at increasing activity in male drd1 KOs, rearing in female drd1 KOs, or reducing spatial d in all drd1 KOs, but produced similar effects in drd1 WT and HT mice as in C57BL/6J mice. Neither dopamine drd2 nor drd3 mutants attenuated modafinil-induced effects. Drd4 mutants exhibited a genotype dose-dependent attenuation of modafinil-induced increases in specific exploration. Furthermore, the drd1 KO effects were largely supported by the SCH23390 study. Thus, the dopamine drd1 receptor appears to exert a primary role in modafinil-induced effects on spontaneous exploration, whereas the dopamine drd4 receptor appears to be important for specific exploration. The modafinil-induced alterations in exploratory behavior may reflect increased synaptic dopamine and secondary actions mediated by dopamine drd1 and drd4 receptors."

The extent of both DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation in the tumor cell is likely to reflect distinctive biological and clinical features, although no studies have addressed its concurrent analysis until now. DNA methylation profiles in sporadic colorectal carcinomas, synchronous adenoma-carcinoma pairs and their matching normal mucosa were analyzed by using the amplification of inter-methylated sites (AIMS) method. A total of 208 AIMS generated sequences were tagged and evaluated for differential methylation. Global indices of hypermethylation and hypomethylation were calculated. All tumors displayed altered patterns of DNA methylation in reference to normal tissue. On average, 24% of the tagged sequences were differentially methylated in the tumor in regard to the normal pair with an overall prevalence of hypomethylations to hypermethylations. Carcinomas exhibited higher levels of hypermethylation than did adenomas but similar levels of hypomethylation. Indices of hypomethylation and hypermethylation showed independent correlations with patient's sex, tumor staging and specific gene hypermethylation. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two main patterns of DNA methylation that were associated to particular mutational spectra in the K-ras and the p53 genes and alternative correlates of hypomethylation and hypermethylation with survival. We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression. Subgroups of colorectal tumors show specific genetic and epigenetic signatures and display distinctive correlates with overall survival."

We performed a multicenter retrospective family study in women with homozygous factor V Leiden, double heterozygous factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene mutation, and women with normal coagulation. Only relatives of index patients with thrombosis formed the study cohort. Fifteen homozygous and 39 double heterozygous women were compared to 182 women with normal coagulation.

However, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of miR-146a to various aspects of the malignant phenotype of human NSCLCs. In functional experiments, miR-146a suppressed cell growth, induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited EGFR downstream signaling in five NSCLC cell lines (H358, H1650, H1975, HCC827 and H292). miR-146a also inhibited the migratory capacity of these NSCLC cells. On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab). These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR. Our results suggest that these effects of miR-146a are due to its targeting of EGFR and NF-\u03baB signaling. We also found, in clinical formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) lung cancer samples, that low expression of miR-146a was correlated with advanced clinical TNM stages and distant metastasis in NSCLC (P<0.05). The patients with high miR-146a expression in their tumors showed longer progression-free survival (25.6 weeks in miR-146a high patients vs. 4.8 weeks in miR-146a low patients, P<0.05). miR-146a is therefore a strong candidate prognostic biomarker in NSCLC. Thus inducing miR-146a might be a therapeutic strategy for NSCLC."

Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cell lysates was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from ATP. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cell grown in the presence of T3 for 48 hours was significantly higher than that of control (0.98 +/- 0.05 mumol Pi h-1 mg protein-1 vs 0.82 +/- 0.10 mumol Pi h-1 mg protein-1, p < 0.05). The Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity could be stimulated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner; maximum stimulatory effect of T3 was seen at a concentration of 10(-7) mol/L. When an inducer [cytosine-beta-D-arabino-furanoside (ARA-C)] was added to the culture medium, the K562 cells showed signs of differentiation and synthesised haemoglobin. At the same time, the Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity remained high. We conclude that T3 stimulates Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cells and in the presence of T3 during differentiation, the enzyme activity remains high."

Regulatory health authorities require that therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses be administered, by the intended route of administration, to two nonclinical species prior to human testing (ICH Expert Working Group. The international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH); Multidisciplinary guidelines; Nonclinical safety studies (M3). http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Multidisciplinary/M3_R2/Step4/M3_R2__Guideline.pdf , 2009). The purpose of these studies is to identify potential target organ toxicity and to determine if the effects are reversible. Liver is a potential site for toxicity caused by orally administered NMEs due to high exposure during first pass after oral administration. A range of clinical chemistry analytes are routinely measured in both nonclinical and clinical studies to evaluate and monitor for hepatotoxicity. While bilirubin itself circulates within a wide range of concentrations in many animal species and humans, without causing adverse effects and possibly providing benefits (Sedlak and Snyder. Pediatrics 113(6):1776-1782, 2004), bilirubin is one of the few readily monitored circulating biomarkers that can provide insight into liver function. Therefore, any changes in plasma or urine bilirubin levels must be carefully evaluated. Changes in bilirubin may occur as a result of adaptive nontoxic changes or severe toxicity. Examples of adaptive nontoxic changes in liver function, which may elevate direct (conjugated) and/or indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin above baseline levels, include reversible inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin metabolism and OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, or MRP2-mediated transport (Keogh. Adv Pharmacol 63:1-42, 2012). Alternatively, hepatocellular necrosis, hypoalbuminuria, or cholestasis may also lead to elevation of bilirubin; in some cases, these effects may be irreversible (FDA/CDER. Guidance for industry drug-induced liver injury: premarketing clinical evaluation. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/\u2026/Guidances/UCM174090.pdf , 2012).This chapter aims to demonstrate application of enzyme kinetic principles in understanding the risk of bilirubin elevation through inhibition of multiple processes-involving both enzymes and transporters. In the sections that follow, we first provide a brief summary of bilirubin formation and disposition. Two case examples are then provided to illustrate the enzyme kinetic studies needed for risk assessment and for identifying the mechanisms of bilirubin elevation. Caveats of methods and data interpretation are discussed in these case studies. The data presented in this chapter is unpublished at the time of compilation of this book. It has been incorporated in this chapter to provide a sense of complexities in enzyme kinetics to the reader."

One of the earliest responses to thyroid hormone administration is a decline in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac output and cardiac contractility. In many ways, this response is similar to the cardiovascular response to exercise and is associated with increased left ventricular work. The majority of cardiac adaptations to changes in thyroid function are physiologic; however, certain patients do demonstrate clinical evidence of cardiac disease. Atrial arrhythmias, limitations in exercise tolerance, and congestive heart failure are reported to occur as a result of hyperthyroidism and are more common in older patients. Thyroid hormone also plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Diastolic hypertension is a common accompaniment of hypothyroidism. By understanding the mechanisms by which thyroid hormone affects both the peripheral circulation as well as the myocardium, it is possible to predict the clinical response to the treatment of various thyroid disease states."

The mouse cDNA (Fanca) encodes a 161-kDa protein that shares 65% amino acid sequence identity with human FANCA. Fanca is located at the distal region of mouse chromosome 8 and has a ubiquitous pattern of expression in embryonic and adult tissues. Expression of the mouse cDNA in human FA-A cells restores the cellular drug sensitivity to normal levels. Thus, the expression pattern, protein structure, chromosomal location, and function of FANCA are conserved in the mouse. We also isolated a novel zinc finger protein, Zfp276, which has five C(2)H(2) domains. Interestingly, Zfp276 is situated in the Fanca locus, and the 3'UTR of its cDNA overlaps with the last four exons of Fanca in a tail-to-tail manner. Zfp276 is expressed in the same tissues as Fanca, but does not complement the mitomycin C (MMC)-sensitive phenotype of FA-A cells. The overlapping genomic organization between Zfp276 and Fanca may have relevance to the disease phenotype of FA."

Some individuals with POTS experience anxiety, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Previously, we identified a mutation, A457P, in the norepinephrine (NE; also known as noradrenaline) transporter (NET; encoded by SLC6A2) in POTS patients. NET is expressed at presynaptic sites in NE neurons and plays a crucial role in regulating NE signaling and homeostasis through NE reuptake into noradrenergic nerve terminals. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that A457P reduces both NET surface trafficking and NE transport and exerts a dominant-negative impact on wild-type NET proteins. Here we report the generation and characterization of NET A457P mice, demonstrating the ability of A457P to drive the POTS phenotype and behaviors that are consistent with reported comorbidities. Mice carrying one A457P allele (NET(+/P)) exhibited reduced brain and sympathetic NE transport levels compared with wild-type (NET(+/+)) mice, whereas transport activity in mice carrying two A457P alleles (NET(P/P)) was nearly abolished. NET(+/P) and NET(P/P) mice exhibited elevations in plasma and urine NE levels, reduced 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and reduced DHPG:NE ratios, consistent with a decrease in sympathetic nerve terminal NE reuptake. Radiotelemetry in unanesthetized mice revealed tachycardia in NET(+/P) mice without a change in blood pressure or baroreceptor sensitivity, consistent with studies of human NET A457P carriers. NET(+/P) mice also demonstrated behavioral changes consistent with CNS NET dysfunction. Our findings support that NET dysfunction is sufficient to produce a POTS phenotype and introduces the first genetic model suitable for more detailed mechanistic studies of the disorder and its comorbidities.

The initial studies were later completed with the analysis of the platelet releasate and microparticle proteome. The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role. Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease.

Four thousand and fifteen cancer patients (2250 lung, 811 squamous upper aero-digestive and 954 kidney) and 3052 controls in central Europe were genotyped for the mis-sense variant rs17879961 (replacement of T by C), which changes an amino acid (I157T) in an active site of the gene product. The heterozygous (T/C) genotype was associated with a highly significantly lower incidence of lung cancer than the common T/T genotype [relative risk (RR), T/C versus T/T, 0.44, with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.63, P < 0.00001] and with a significantly lower incidence of upper aero-digestive cancer (RR 0.44, CI 0.26-0.73, P = 0.001; P = 0.000001 for lung or upper aero-digestive cancer). Protection was significantly greater for squamous than adenomatous lung cancer (P = 0.001). There was an increase of borderline significance in kidney cancer (RR 1.44, CI 0.99-2.00, P = 0.06). This unexpected halving of tobacco-related cancer (since replicated independently) implies much greater absolute risk reduction in smokers than in non-smokers. The mechanism is unknown: perhaps squamous stem cell apoptosis following smoke exposure causes net harm (e.g. by forcing nearby stem cells to divide before they have repaired their own DNA damage from tobacco smoke). If so, reducing the rate of apoptosis by reducing CHEK2 activity could be protective-although not smoking would be far more so."

Cells with NF2 mutations exhibit elevated levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and aberrant cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. The NF2 gene product, merlin, associates with adherens junction protein complexes, suggesting that part of its function as a tumor suppressor involves regulating cell junctions. Here, we find that a novel PDZ protein, called erbin, binds directly to the merlin-binding partner, EBP0, and regulates adherens junction dissociation through a MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Reducing erbin expression using a targeted siRNA in primary cultures of Schwann cells results in altered cell-cell interactions, disruption of E-cadherin adherens junctions, increased cell proliferation, and elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK, all phenotypes observed in cells that lack merlin. Reduction of erbin expression also results in the dissociation of merlin from adherens junction proteins and an increase in the levels of phosphorylated merlin. These phenotypes can be rescued if cells with reduced levels of erbin are treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK kinase. Collectively, these data indicate that erbin regulates MAP kinase activation in Schwann cells and suggest that erbin links merlin to both adherens junction protein complexes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway."

Therefore, we designed this study to identify differences (and/or similarities) in the microbiota of children with autism (without gastrointestinal dysfunction: n = 23; with gastrointestinal dysfunction: n = 28) and their neurotypical siblings (n = 53) who share a similar environment using bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing. Regardless of the diagnosis and sociodemographic characteristics, overall, Firmicutes (70%), Bacteroidetes (20%) and Proteobacteria (4%) were the most dominant phyla in samples. Results did not indicate clinically meaningful differences between groups. The data do not support the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal microbiota of children with ASD plays a role in the symptomatology of ASD. Other explanations for the gastrointestinal dysfunction in this population should be considered including elevated anxiety and self-restricted diets."

Until recently, transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) was considered the major source for cAMP in the cell, and the role of cAMP signaling was therefore attributed exclusively to the activity of this family of enzymes. However, increasing evidence demonstrates the role of an alternative, intracellular source of cAMP produced by type 10 soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). In contrast to tmAC, sAC produces cAMP in various intracellular microdomains close to specific cAMP targets, e.g., in nucleus and mitochondria. Ongoing research demonstrates involvement of sAC in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The present review is focused on the role of cAMP signaling, particularly that of sAC, in cell death and growth. Although the contributions of sAC to the regulation of these cellular functions have only recently been discovered, current data suggest that sAC plays key roles in mitochondrial bioenergetics and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, as well as cell proliferation and development. Furthermore, recent reports suggest the importance of sAC in several pathologies associated with apoptosis as well as in oncogenesis.

Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study; their thyroid hormone profiles were determined at 13 sampling points during surgery and for 6 days afterwards. Serum total tri-iodothyronine (T3) and free T3 (FT3) concentrations decreased significantly after surgery (P<0.001) and they remained significantly low until the end of the study. Free thyroxine (FT4) and T4 declined significantly immediately after surgery (P<0.05 for FT4, P<0.001 for T4) but they returned to baseline values (24 h and 96 h post-surgery respectively). Serum reverse T3 increased remarkably 36 h after surgery (P<0.001) and remained significantly higher than the baseline value throughout the study. A relevant finding was that the days of post-operative hospitalization (10+/-3 days, means+/-S.D.) was inversely correlated with the slope of the recovery of T3 concentration (P<0.001) or with the area under the plasma curves of T3 (P=0.024, time range 72-144 h) and the FT3/FT4 ratio (P=0.037, time range 72-144 h) during the post-operative period. Our data suggest a prolonged reduction of T4 to T3 conversion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and indicate that the recovery period is the most critical in the evaluation of a possibly successful approach for T3 substitutive therapy."

Within an animal group CNEs are the most conserved sequences but between groups they are normally diverged beyond recognition. Alternative CNEs are, however, associated with an overlapping set of genes that control development in all animals. Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose >550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the \"re-wiring\" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups."

Since salivary gland secretion is dependent on a variety of proteins, we analyzed the changes in protein expression in transplanted glands of epiphora patients with 2-D gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and evaluated their possible roles in epiphora. There were 23 proteins that showed altered expression in the glands of epiphora patients, 15 being up-expressed and 8 being down-expressed. The expression of secretory proteins was decreased in these glands, including alpha-amylase, cystatin S, SA, and SN. In contrast, cytoskeletal proteins were all up-regulated, including actin and vimentin. Immunofluorescence revealed that the intensity ratio of F-actin in apical and lateral cytoplasm to total F-actin in acini was decreased in the glands of epiphora patients. Carbachol stimulation induced a similar redistribution of F-actin in the control glands. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was increased in both carbachol-stimulated and epiphora glands. Preincubation of submandibular glands with ERK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 inhibited carbachol-induced F-actin redistribution. These results indicated that differentially expressed proteins participated in the hypersecretion of transplanted submandibular glands and the redistribution of F-actin might be involved in this hypersecretion in an ERK1/2-dependent manner."

Since this discovery, two representatives of TAMs, namely 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and thyronamine (T(0)AM), have been detected in vivo. Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass. Although their physiological function remains elusive, 3-T(1)AM and T(0)AM have already revealed promising therapeutic potential because they represent the only endogenous compounds inducing hypothermia as a prophylactic or acute treatment of stroke and might thus be expected to cause fewer side effects than synthetic compounds. This review article summarizes the still somewhat scattered data on TAMs obtained both recently and more than 20 yr ago to yield a complete and updated picture of the current state of TAM research."

Whereas mono-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is targeted to the vacuole, poly-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is directed instead to the proteasome. Here we investigate the structural requirements for mono- and poly-ubiquitination of Gpa1. We find that variants of Gpa1 engineered to be unstable are more likely to be poly-ubiquitinated and less likely to be mono-ubiquitinated. In addition, mutants that cannot be myristoylated are no longer mono-ubiquitinated but are still polyubiquitinated. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is necessary for Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vivo and that the purified enzyme is sufficient to catalyze Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that mono- and poly-ubiquitination have distinct enzyme and substrate recognition requirements; whereas poly-ubiquitination targets misfolded protein for degradation, a distinct ubiquitination apparatus targets the fully mature, fully myristoylated G protein for mono-ubiquitination and delivery to the vacuole."

Pseudofam uses a large-scale parallelized homology search algorithm (implemented as an extension of the PseudoPipe pipeline) to identify pseudogenes. Each identified pseudogene is assigned to its parent protein family and subsequently aligned to each other by transferring the parent domain alignments from the Pfam family. Pseudogenes are also given additional annotation based on an ontology, reflecting their mode of creation and subsequent history. In particular, our annotation highlights the association of pseudogene families with genomic features, such as segmental duplications. In addition, pseudogene families are associated with key statistics, which identify outlier families with an unusual degree of pseudogenization. The statistics also show how the number of genes and pseudogenes in families correlates across different species.

Oxygen uptake decreased significantly after hormone replacement (24.1+/-6.3 vs 17.1+/-4.2 ml x kg x min(-1); p=0.03).Minute ventilation also showed an enhanced performance in treated patients (28.0+/-8.1 vs 23.5+/-5.6 l x min(-1); p=0.03), as did the heart rate (128+/-17 vs 121+/-17 bpm; p=0.03). There were no changes in the untreated group. The results demonstrate that submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance improved after six months of TSH normalization and this improvement can help enhance the ability to carry out daily life activities in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism."

This T(3) toxicity was caused by an increased apoptotic cell death rate, which was accompanied by a decreased proliferation rate. Inhibitory effects of T(3) on glucose-induced insulin secretion were already seen after 24 h of incubation, indicating that the deleterious effects of T(3) were time-dependent, changing from specific cellular dysfunctions to a severe and extended disturbance of the cellular survival program. Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. These micromolar T(3) concentrations were significantly higher than the concentration range of T(3) receptor binding, indicating that other non-receptor-mediated mechanisms beyond the receptor level must be responsible for the observed toxic effects of T(3) in vitro."

With mean HbF levels of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the distribution of HbF/F-cell can greatly vary, even if the mean is constant.

Lynch syndrome is most frequently caused by mutations in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Familial adenomatous polyposis is manifested as colonic polyposis caused by mutations in the APC gene and is also inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Finally, MYH-associated polyposis is caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner but may or may not be associated with polyps. There are variants of both familial adenomatous polyposis (Gardner syndrome--with extracolonic features--and Turcot syndrome, which features medulloblastoma) and Lynch syndrome (Muir-Torre syndrome features sebaceous skin carcinomas, and Turcot syndrome features glioblastomas). Although a clinical diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis can be made using colonoscopy, genetic testing is needed to inform at-risk relatives. Because of the overlapping phenotypes between attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, MYH-associated polyposis, and Lynch syndrome, genetic testing is needed to distinguish among these conditions. This distinction is important, especially for women with Lynch syndrome, who are at increased risk for gynecological cancers. Clinical testing for these genes has progressed rapidly in the past few years with advances in technologies and the lower cost of reagents, especially for sequencing. To assist clinical laboratories in developing and validating testing for this group of inherited colorectal cancers, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics has developed the following technical standards and guidelines. An algorithm for testing is also proposed."

CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. Here, in human, rat and mouse, we identify a novel mechanism linking CaMKII and hyperglycaemic signalling in diabetes mellitus, which is a key risk factor for heart and neurodegenerative diseases. Acute hyperglycaemia causes covalent modification of CaMKII by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII at Ser\u2009279 activates CaMKII autonomously, creating molecular memory even after Ca(2+) concentration declines. O-GlcNAc-modified CaMKII is increased in the heart and brain of diabetic humans and rats. In cardiomyocytes, increased glucose concentration significantly enhances CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events that can contribute to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias. These effects were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAc signalling or genetic ablation of CaMKII\u03b4. In intact perfused hearts, arrhythmias were aggravated by increased glucose concentration through O-GlcNAc- and CaMKII-dependent pathways. In diabetic animals, acute blockade of O-GlcNAc inhibited arrhythmogenesis. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII is a novel signalling event in pathways that may contribute critically to cardiac and neuronal pathophysiology in diabetes and other diseases. "

Functionally, miR-296 controls a global cell motility gene signature in epithelial cells by transcriptionally repressing the cell polarity-cell plasticity module, Scribble (Scrib). In turn, loss of miR-296 causes aberrantly increased and mislocalized Scrib in human tumors, resulting in exaggerated random cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness. Re-expression of miR-296 in MDA-MB231 cells inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Finally, miR-296 or Scrib levels predict tumor relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

Neuronal death in the striatum-the most obvious manifestation of the disease-is likely to result from widespread dysregulation of gene expression in various brain regions. To date, several potential mechanisms for this have been discovered, including one involving REST (RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor), a master regulator of neuronal genes. Recently, independent studies have demonstrated that post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs is also disrupted in HD. Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. These changes occur downstream of REST, and are likely to result in major disruption of mRNA regulation and neuronal function. In this study we will discuss these findings and their implications for our understanding of HD. Using updated bioinformatic analysis, we predict 21 new candidate microRNAs in HD. We propose future strategies for unifying large-scale transcriptional and microRNA datasets with the aim of explaining HD aetiology. By way of example, we show how available genomic datasets can be integrated to provide independent, analytical validation for dysregulation of REST and microRNA mir-124 in HD. As a consequence, gene ontology analysis indicates that HD is characterised by a broad-based depression of neural genes in the caudate and motor cortex. Thus, we propose that a combination of REST, microRNAs and possibly other non-coding RNAs profoundly affect the neuronal transcriptome in HD."

In this study, we found that proteasome inhibitors exert cytotoxic effects on T-ALL cells with constitutive activation of Notch1 to a similar extent as myeloma cells. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib repressed the transcription of Notch1 and downstream effectors including Hes1, GATA3, RUNX3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) (p65 and p50), coincided with downregulation of the major transactivator Sp1 and its dissociation from Notch1 promoter. Overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) significantly ameliorated bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity against T-ALL cells. Drug combination studies revealed that bortezomib showed synergistic or additive effects with key drugs for the treatment of T-ALL such as dexamethasone (DEX), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, which were readily abolished by NICD overexpression. The synergy of bortezomib and DEX was confirmed in vivo using a murine xenograft model. Our findings provide a molecular basis and rationale for the inclusion of proteasome inhibitors in treatment strategies for T-ALL. "

The aim of this study was to determine if NEDD9 was involved in the progression and metastasis of cervical cancer. The experimental results showed NEDD9 protein was overexpressed in cervical cancer compared with normal cervical epithelium tissues. Overexpression of NEDD9 was correlated with histological grading, lymph node metastasis, and FIGO stage of cervical cancer. Silencing NEDD9 resulted in tyrosine dephosphorylation of FAK and SRC oncoproteins, and decreased cell migration and invasion in the cervical carcinoma SiHa and HeLa cells. Overexpression of NEDD9 led to tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and SRC oncoproteins, and increased cell migration and invasion. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of NEDD9 was significantly decreased via suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK or SRC, suggesting a positive feedback loop of tyrosine phosphorylation between NEDD9 and FAK or SRC. In addition, our data showed that silencing NEDD9 decreased Vimentin expression and increased E-cadherin expression in cervical cancer cells, and vice versa. E-cadherin was subject to regulation of NEDD9, FAK and SRC, but altered neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor total NEDD9. Our findings suggest that NEDD9 is overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues and cells, and overexpressed NEDD9 promotes migration and invasion in cervical carcinoma cells, probably via a positive feedback loop of tyrosine phosphorylation between NEDD9 and FAK or SRC.

Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin protected cortical neurons from ischemic injury.

Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, prevented cytochrome c release, and inhibited caspase-3 activation.

One group of C57BL/6J mice received LPS via intratracheal injection (n = 6), and another received sterile water (n = 7). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at 72 h after treatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted and used for qPCR and 16S rRNA gene-tag (V3-V4) sequencing (Illumina). The bacterial load in BAL from ALI mice was increased fivefold (P = 0.03). The community complexity remained unchanged (Simpson index, P = 0.7); the Shannon diversity index indicated the increase of community evenness in response to ALI (P = 0.07). Principal coordinate analysis and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test (P = 0.005) revealed a significant difference between microbiota of control and ALI groups. Bacteria from families Xanthomonadaceae and Brucellaceae increased their abundance in the ALI group as determined by Metastats test (P < 0.02). In concordance with the 16s-tag data, Stenotrohomonas maltophilia (Xanthomonadaceae) and Ochrobactrum anthropi (Brucellaceae) were isolated from lungs of mice from both groups. Metabolic profiling of BAL detected the presence of bacterial substrates suitable for both isolates. Additionally, microbiota from LPS-treated mice intensified IL-6-induced lung inflammation in naive mice. We conclude that the morbid transformation of ALI microbiota was attributed to the set of inborn opportunistic pathogens thriving in the environment of inflamed lung, rather than the external infectious agents.

A number of morphologic changes were seen, including (1) poor development of mastoid air cells, (2) foreshortening of the carotid canals, (3) narrowing of the skull base, (4) \"towering\" petrous ridges, and (5) relative \"rotation\" of the cochlea and other temporal bone structures. The most significant change was the rotational effect, which was more pronounced medially, resulting in an abnormal orientation of inner ear structures relative to middle ear structures and of middle ear structures relative to the external auditory canal. There was a notable lack of evidence for otitis media or its sequelae in any of the achondroplastic subjects. Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults. We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested. Intrinsic vestibulocochlear changes below the limits of resolution of high-resolution CT scanning may be responsible."

Injury after implantation was assessed by serum ALT, histological necrosis, TUNEL, Caspase 3 activity, 30-day survival, and cytochrome c and 4-hydroxynonenal immunostaining. Multiphoton microscopy after LT monitored mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. After LT, ALT increased three times more in WT compared to KO (p < 0.05). Necrosis and TUNEL were more than two times greater in WT than KO (p < 0.05). Immunostaining showed a >80% decrease of mitochondrial cytochrome c release in KO compared to WT (p < 0.01). Lipid peroxidation was similarly decreased. Every KO graft but one survived longer than all WT grafts (p < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier). After LT, depolarization of mitochondria occurred in 73% of WT hepatocytes, which decreased to 28% in KO (p < 0.05). In conclusion, donor JNK2 promotes injury after mouse LT via the MPT.

By blocking mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives HIF-1\u03b1 protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1\u03b1 synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1\u03b1 degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives HIF-1\u03b1 synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3. Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels and VEGF-A expression. Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 regulate HIF-1\u03b1 translation, VEGF-A is primarily under the control of 4E-BP1/eIF4E. S6K1 inhibition reduces HIF-1\u03b1 but not VEGF-A expression, suggesting that mTORC1 mediates VEGF-A expression via both HIF-1\u03b1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our work has important implications for the treatment of vascularised tumours, where mTORC1 acts as a central mediator of STAT3, HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF-A and angiogenesis via multiple signalling mechanisms."

Here we report the identification of mixed lineage kinase domain-like, MLKL, as a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrosis. Through screening a kinase/phosphatase shRNA library in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, we found that knockdown of MLKL blocked TNF-induced necrosis. Our data suggest that MLKL functions downstream of RIP1 and RIP3 and is recruited to the necrosome through its interaction with RIP3. Finally, we found that MLKL is required for the generation of ROS and the late-phase activation of JNK during TNF-induced necrosis. However, because these two events are not involved in TNF-induced necrosis in HT-29 cells, the target of MLKL during TNF-induced necrosis remains elusive. Taken together, our study suggests that MLKL is a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrotic cell death."

The RNA product resulting from extension of B2 RNA by the Pol II RdRP can be removed from Pol II by a factor present in nuclear extracts. Treatment of cells with \u03b1-amanitin or actinomycin D revealed that extension of B2 RNA by Pol II destabilizes the RNA.

In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. Interestingly, there is a significant overlap between RA susceptibility genes and those of other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes, which suggests common pathogenic mechanisms. Genetic analyses may not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA, but may also open new avenues for therapeutic approaches, because overactive immune-signaling pathways might specifically be addressed by biologic therapies. However, the predictive value of many of the recent findings of large-scale genetic analyses in identifying new genetic polymorphisms remains low. We describe the current knowledge about the role of non-MHC genes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."

There are currently no effective approaches to protect people from benzene-induced hematotoxicity and AA. In addition, current treatments for AA have limitations with short- and long-term risks. Protective agents and new therapeutic approaches, therefore, are needed to prevent and treat the disease. Amifostine is a well-known cytoprotective agent and has been widely used in clinical for protecting normal tissues from the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The authors utilized an established mouse model to determine the protective effect of amifostine on benzene-induced bone marrow hematotoxicity. Whole-blood cell count, morphological and histopathological alterations in the bone marrow and spleen, as well as the production of inducible toxic oxidative species were examined and compared among the mouse groups. Amifostine treatment in benzene-exposed mice significantly improved blood cell counts, and morphological and histopathological signs of hematotoxicity in the bone marrow as well as in the spleen. Moreover, amifostine prevented benzene-induced bone marrow and spleen cell apoptosis and rescinded the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by benzene exposure. Finally, amifostine significantly inhibited the levels of reactive oxidative species and lipid peroxidation induced by benzene exposure. These data suggest that amifostine appears to have substantial protective effect on benzene-induced bone marrow hematotoxicity."

At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity, learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity. Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function."

These phosphoproteins are evolutionarily conserved across many organisms and are important in a variety of synaptic functions, including synaptogenesis and the regulation of neurotransmitter release. A number of genome-wide scans, meta-analyses, and genetic susceptibility studies have implicated the synapsin II gene (3p25) in the etiology of schizophrenia (SZ) and other psychiatric disorders. Further studies have found a reduction of synapsin II mRNA and protein in the prefrontal cortex in post-mortem samples from schizophrenic patients. Disruptions in the expression of this gene may cause synaptic dysfunction, which can result in neurotransmitter imbalances, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of SZ. SZ is a costly, debilitating psychiatric illness affecting approximately 1.1% of the world's population, amounting to 51 million people today. The disorder is characterized by positive (hallucinations, paranoia), negative (social withdrawal, lack of motivation), and cognitive (memory impairments, attention deficits) symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the structure, function, and involvement of the synapsin family, specifically synapsin II, in the pathophysiology of SZ and possible target for therapeutic intervention/implications.

In the present study, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 18 genes involved in BER using a tagging SNP approach in a large series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. 144 SNPs were analyzed in a two stage study involving 23,463 carriers from the CIMBA consortium (the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2). Eleven SNPs showed evidence of association with breast and/or ovarian cancer at p<0.05 in the combined analysis. Four of the five genes for which strongest evidence of association was observed were DNA glycosylases. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 \u00d7 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-3)).

Both the diagnostic criteria of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum and the problems involved in the differential diagnosis derived from the lack of definition of the radiological spectrum were reviewed. The microbiota comes to the fore as a possible factor determining the disease, together with extrinsic factors such as tobacco, salt ingestion or vitamin D deficiency. Advances made in immunomodulation are driving the progress being made in the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the first treatment with positive results in the primarily progressive forms and tocilizumab, a drug product for rheumatoid arthritis, stands out as a potential candidate for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica. Certain antibiotics and vitamins could also play a role in the treatment of MS. In this edition of the Congress special attention was paid to personalised therapy. To date, 11 drugs have been approved for use in Europe. There is a need for therapeutic algorithms that help us to choose the best treatment for each patient. Likewise, we need to be able to identify, in the early stages of the disease, the risk of developing disability, so as to be able to design therapeutic strategies. To do so, molecular biomarkers and other predictive tools are required. The problems that still exist in software technology in magnetic resonance hinder its application in daily clinical practice. "

Autophagy signaling pathway was regulated by vitamin D3 to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Rotavirus (RV) was a major cause of the severe diarrheal disease in young children and young animals. Although evidence suggested that vitamin D3 attenuates the negative effects of RV infection via the retinoic acid-inducible gene I signaling pathway, little is known of its antiviral effect whether through the regulation of autophagy. The present study was performed to investigate whether vitamin D3 alleviates RV infection in pig and porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) models via regulating the autophagy signaling pathway. RV administration increased the Beclin 1 mRNA abundance in porcine jejunum and ileum. 5000 IU/kg dietary vitamin D3 supplementation greatly up-regulated LC3-II/LC3-I ratios and PR-39 mRNA expression under the condition of RV challenged. The viability of IPEC-J2 was significantly inhibited by RV infection. Incubation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 significantly decreased the concentrations of RV antigen and non-structural protein 4 (NSP4), and up-regulated the mRNA expression of Beclin 1 and PR-39 in the RV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. And then, based on the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 treatment and RV infection, LC3-II mRNA expression in cells was inhibited by an autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1, a class of inhibitors of membrane ATPases, inhibits maturation of autophagic vacuoles) treatment numerically enhanced the LC3-II mRNA abundance, but had no effect on NSP4 concentration. Furthermore, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 decreased the p62 mRNA expression and increased porcine cathelicidins (PMAP23, PG1-5 and PR-39) mRNA expression in the RV-infected cells. Taken together, these results indicated that vitamin D3 attenuates RV infection through regulating autophagic maturation and porcine cathelicidin genes expression."

One of these reactions, endonucleolytic 3' cleavage at the polyadenylation site, prepares the pre-mRNA for addition of the poly(A) tail and defines the 3' untranslated region (UTR), which typically contains important gene expression regulatory sequences. While the protein factors responsible for the endonucleolytic cleavage have been largely identified, the means by which their action is limited to the 3' end of the transcription unit and coordinated with other co-transcriptional events remains unclear. In this review, we summarize and review recent findings revealing that the mammalian 3' cleavage factors undergo extensive post-translational modification. These modifications include: arginine methylation, lysine sumoylation, lysine acetylation, and the phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Every cleavage factor, though not every subunit, is affected. Human Fip1 and the 59 kDa subunit of cleavage factor I emerge as the most frequently modified core cleavage factor subunits. We outline and compare the various proteomic methods that have uncovered these modifications, and review emerging hypotheses concerning their function. The roles of these covalent but reversible modifications in other systems suggest that 3' end formation in mammals relies upon post-translational modification for proper function and regulation."

The morphogen Nodal was proposed to form a long-range signaling gradient via a reaction-diffusion system, on the basis of differential diffusion rates of Nodal and its antagonist Lefty. Here we use a specific zebrafish Nodal biosensor combined with immunofluorescence for phosphorylated Smad2 to demonstrate that endogenous Nodal is unlikely to diffuse over a long range. Instead, short-range Nodal signaling activation in a temporal window is sufficient to determine the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain. The size of this temporal window is set by the differentially timed production of Nodal and Lefty, which arises mainly from repression of Lefty translation by the microRNA miR-430. Thus, temporal information is transformed into spatial information to define the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain and, consequently, to specify mesendoderm. "

A tendency toward increased NKX2.2 expression was consistent with its detection in two-thirds of CHI-D \u03b4-cell nuclei, similar to the fetal pancreas, and implied immature \u03b4-cell function. CHI-D \u03b4-cells also comprised 10% of cells displaying nucleomegaly. In CHI-D, increased proliferation was most elevated in duct (5- to 11-fold) and acinar (7- to 47-fold) lineages. Increased \u03b2-cell proliferation observed in some cases was offset by an increase in apoptosis; this is in keeping with no difference in INSULIN expression or surface area stained for insulin between CHI-D and control pancreas. However, nuclear localization of CDK6 and P27 was markedly enhanced in CHI-D \u03b2-cells compared with cytoplasmic localization in control cells. These combined data support normal \u03b2-cell mass in CHI-D, but with G1/S molecules positioned in favor of cell cycle progression.

METHODS A 20-year retrospective review identified patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and secondary craniosynostosis at 3 major craniofacial centers. Parameters examined included sex, age at diagnosis of head shape anomaly, affected sutures, etiology of rickets, presenting symptoms, number and type of surgical interventions, and associated diagnoses. A review of the literature was performed to optimize treatment recommendations. RESULTS Ten patients were identified (8 males, 2 females). Age at presentation ranged from 1 to 9 years. The most commonly affected suture was the sagittal (6/10 patients). Etiologies included antacid-induced rickets, autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets. Nine patients had undergone at least 1 cranial vault remodeling (CVR) surgery. Three patients underwent subsequent surgeries in later years. Four patients underwent formal intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, 3 of which revealed elevated ICP. Three patients were diagnosed with a Chiari Type I malformation. CONCLUSIONS Secondary craniosynostosis develops postnatally due to metabolic or mechanical factors. The most common metabolic cause is hypophosphatemic rickets, which has a variety of etiologies. Head shape changes occur later and with a more heterogeneous presentation compared with that of primary craniosynostosis. CVR may be required to prevent or relieve elevated ICP and abnormalities of the cranial vault. Children with hypophosphatemic rickets who develop head shape abnormalities should be promptly referred to a craniofacial specialist. "

Our case report supports the co-occurrence of both diseases and suggests that adalimumab approved for CD might also be a safe and effective therapeutic option in the treatment of HS."

In this paper we review the various instruments available to screen the patients for delirium, instruments available to diagnose delirium, assess the severity, cognitive functions, motoric subtypes, etiology and associated distress. Among the various screening instruments, NEECHAM confusion scale and delirium observation scale appear to be most suitable screening instrument for patients' in general medical and surgical wards, depending on the type of rater (physician or nurse). In general, the instruments which are used for diagnosis [i.e., confusion assessment method (CAM), CAM for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU), Delirium Rating Scale-revised version (DRS-R-98), memorial selirium assessment scale, etc.] are based on various Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria and have good to excellent reliability and fair to good validity. Among the various diagnostic instruments, CAM is considered to be most useful instrument because of its accuracy, brevity, and ease of use by clinicians and lay interviewers. In contrast, DRS-R-98 appears to be a comprehensive instrument useful for diagnosis, severity rating and is sensitive to change and hence can be used for monitoring patients over a period. In the ICU setting, evidence suggests that CAM-ICU and Nursing Delirium Screening Scale had comparable sensitivities, but CAM-ICU has higher specificity. With regard to assessment of delirium in pediatric age group, certain instruments like Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale and pediatric CAM-ICU has been designed and have been found to be useful.

We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish. mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into the identities, formation, and evolution of zebrafish 3' UTRs provide a resource for studying gene regulation during vertebrate development."

Recent studies have shown that UCEs function as long-range enhancers of flanking genes or are involved in splicing when overlapping with exons. The depletion of UCEs among copy number variation as well as the significant under-representation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within UCEs have also revealed their evolutional and functional importance indicating their potential impact on disease, such as cancer. In the present study, we investigated the influence of six SNPs within UCEs on familial breast cancer risk. Two out of six SNPs showed an association with familial breast cancer risk. Whereas rs9572903 showed only a borderline significant association, the frequency of the rare [G] allele of rs2056116 was higher in cases than in controls indicating an increased familial breast cancer risk ([G] versus [A]: odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.30, P = 0.0020; [GG] versus [AA]: OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.15-1.74, P = 0.0011).

This Zebrafish Enhancer Detector (ZED) vector harbors several key improvements, among them a sensitive and specific minimal promoter chosen for optimal enhancer activity detection, insulator sequences to shield the minimal promoter from position effects, and a positive control for transgenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model."

We performed whole exome sequencing in a Turkish patient clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease from a consanguineous family with a complex history of neurological and immunological disorders and identified a mutation in NOTCH3 (p.R1231C), previously described as causing cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Complete screening of NOTCH3 in a cohort of 95 early onset AD cases and 95 controls did not reveal any additional pathogenic mutations. Although the complex history of disease in this family precluded us to establish segregation of the mutation found with disease, our results show that exome sequencing is a rapid, cost-effective and comprehensive tool to detect genetic mutations, allowing for the identification of unexpected genetic causes of clinical phenotypes. As etiological based therapeutics become more common, this method will be key in diagnosing and treating disease."

To combine the OR and corresponding 95% CI, we used the fixed effects model during meta-analysis. Based on eight independent populations with a total of 5,719 cases and 6,525 controls, we found a slightly reduced risk of HBV-induced HCC in individuals with the minor T allele compared with individuals with the common G allele (T versus G: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91, P(Het) = 0.974).

Excitement over this technique derives from the ease with which it can be used to switch-off a specific gene in almost any organism, thereby allowing the role of that gene to be identified. More importantly, it offers the potential to treat certain diseases by switching-off the causative genes. Key to the RNAi pathway are the small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which at 21-23 nucleotides in length are very amenable to analogue development by chemists. However in comparison to the use of oligonucleotides as antisense agents, an area where many chemists first developed an interest in nucleic acids, the RNAi pathway is exceedingly complex. The literature is also complicated by the fact that the phenomenon has been studied in a wide range of organisms. In this tutorial review we have presented the subject from a more chemical perspective, incorporating a glossary to give a clear explanation of the specialist terms. However, the coverage of the biology remains sufficiently detailed to give the reader the necessary insight that we believe will be essential for the successful design of chemically modified siRNA."

Three additional factors Pds5, Wapl, and Sororin bind to cohesin and modulate its dynamic association with chromatin. There are two Pds5 proteins in vertebrates, Pds5A and Pds5B, but their functional specificity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Pds5 proteins are essential for cohesion establishment by allowing Smc3 acetylation by the cohesin acetyl transferases (CoATs) Esco1/2 and binding of Sororin. While both proteins contribute to telomere and arm cohesion, Pds5B is specifically required for centromeric cohesion. Furthermore, reduced accumulation of Aurora B at the inner centromere region in cells lacking Pds5B impairs its error correction function, promoting chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Our work supports a model in which the composition and function of cohesin complexes differs between different chromosomal regions. "

In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. The plasmepsins are produced from inactive zymogens, proplasmepsins, having unusually long N-terminal prosegments of more than 120 amino acids. Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that the conversion process of proplasmepsins to plasmepsins differs substantially from the gastric and plant aspartic proteinases. Instead of blocking substrate access to a pre-formed active site, the prosegment enforces a conformation in which proplasmepsin cannot form a functional active site. We have determined crystal structures of plasmepsin and proplasmepsin from P.vivax. The three-dimensional structure of P.vivax plasmepsin is typical of the monomeric aspartic proteinases, and the structure of P.vivax proplasmepsin is similar to that of P.falciparum proplasmepsin II. A dramatic refolding of the mature N terminus and a large (18 degrees ) reorientation of the N-domain between P.vivax proplasmepsin and plasmepsin results in a severe distortion of the active site region of the zymogen relative to that of the mature enzyme. The present structures confirm that the mode of inactivation observed originally in P.falciparum proplasmepsin II, i.e. an incompletely formed active site, is a true structural feature and likely represents the general mode of inactivation of the related proplasmepsins."

Using the extracellular domain of Dectin-1 as \u03b2-glucan-specific probes, we succeeded in detection of soluble and Dectin-1-reactive \u03b2-glucan discharged from mouse RAW 264.7 and human THP-1 macrophage cell lines as well as mouse peritoneal macrophages, which had phagocytized insoluble \u03b2-glucan particles. The RAW 264.7 cell culture-supernatant containing the discharged \u03b2-glucan stimulated na\u00efve RAW 264.7 cells, resulting in the induction of cytokine expression. Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive \u03b2-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186). Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by a Cu(2+)/ascorbic acid system solubilized insoluble \u03b2-glucan particles in vitro, and a part of the solubilized \u03b2-glucan was Dectin-1 reactive and biologically active in macrophage activation. The soluble and biologically active \u03b2-glucan was degraded further during prolonged exposure to ROS. These results suggest that degraded but Dectin-1-reactive \u03b2-glucan is discharged from macrophage cells phagocytizing insoluble \u03b2-glucan particles and stimulates not only themselves again but also the other na\u00efve phagocytes, leading to the effective elimination of infecting microbes and the ultimate breakdown and inactivation of metabolically resistant \u03b2-glucan."

Like other calcium-regulated Noxes, Nox5 has an EF-hand-containing calcium-binding domain at its N-terminus, a transmembrane heme-containing region, and a C-terminal dehydrogenase (DH) domain that binds FAD and NADPH. While Nox1-4 require regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on any subunits. We found that inactive point mutants and truncated forms of Nox5 (including the naturally expressed splice form, Nox5S) inhibit full-length Nox5, consistent with formation of a dominant negative complex. Oligomerization of full-length Nox5 was demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation of coexpressed, differentially tagged forms of Nox5 and occurred in a manner independent of calcium ion. Several approaches were used to show that the DH domain mediates oligomerization: Nox5 could be isolated as a multimer when the calcium-binding domain and/or the N-terminal polybasic region (PBR-N) was deleted, but deletion of the DH domain eliminated oligomerization. Further, a chimera containing the transmembrane domain of Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor-containing phosphatase (CiVSP) fused to the Nox5 DH domain formed a co-immunoprecipitating complex with, and functioned as a dominant inhibitor of, full-length Nox5. Radiation inactivation of Nox5 overexpressed in HEK293 cells and endogenously expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cells indicated molecular masses of \u223c350 and \u223c300 kDa, respectively, consistent with a tetramer being the functionally active unit. Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is mediated by its dehydrogenase domain. As a result of oligomerization, the short, calcium-independent splice form, Nox5S, may function as an endogenous inhibitor of calcium-stimulated ROS generation by full-length Nox5."

In the present study we measured the effect of quinpirole and dopamine on the hydroxylation of tyrosine in the adrenals, using the method of DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) accumulation following the administration of the inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazyne). In view of the large amounts of catecholamines in the adrenal tissue samples, this necessitated a modification of the method for analysing DOPA. Both quinpirole and dopamine significantly enhanced the rate of DOPA accumulation in the adrenals, indicating stimulation of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. The effect of dopamine was blocked by domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that penetrates poorly into the central nervous system. Thus the effect of dopamine, which itself penetrates poorly into the central nervous system, was presumably mediated peripherally. Similarly epinine, i.e. the N-methyl derivative of dopamine, appeared to enhance adrenal catecholamine synthesis, as indicated by an elevated adrenal dopamine level. The data support the view that stimulation of peripherally located dopamine D2-like receptors can enhance the rate of adrenal catecholamine synthesis by stimulating the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase."

On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated expression."

The post-recycling complex (PRC) then re-initiates mRNA translation. Here, we probed the so far unknown architecture of the 1-MDa PRC (40S/30S\u00b7ABCE1) by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Our study reveals ABCE1 bound to the translational factor-binding (GTPase) site with multiple cross-link contacts of the helix-loop-helix motif to the S24e ribosomal protein. Cross-linking of the FeS cluster domain to the ribosomal protein S12 substantiates an extreme lever-arm movement of the FeS cluster domain during ribosome recycling. We were thus able to reconstitute and structurally analyse a key complex in the translational cycle, resembling the link between translation initiation and ribosome recycling."

Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions.

The telomerase expression/activity appears to be one of the most crucial factors to study to improve cancer therapy and prevention. However, this multisubunit enzymatic complex can be regulated at various levels. Thus, several strategies have been proposed to control telomerase in cancer cells such as anti-sense technology against TR and TERT, ribozymes against TERT, anti-estrogens, progesterone, vitamin D, retinoic acid, quadruplex stabilizers, telomere and telomerase targeting agents, modulation of interaction with other proteins involved in the regulation of telomerase and telomeres, etc. However, the transcription control of key telomerase subunits seems to play the crucial role in whole complexes activity and cancer cells immortality. Thus, the research of telomerase regulation can bring significant insight into the knowledge concerning stem cells metabolism but also ageing.

In mice, the H2afy gene encodes two splice variants, mH2A1.1 and mH2A1.2 and a second gene, H2afy2, encodes an additional mH2A2 protein. Both mH2A isoforms have been found enriched on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in differentiated mammalian female cells, and are incorporated into the chromatin of developmentally-regulated genes. To investigate the functional significance of mH2A isoforms for X chromosome inactivation (XCI), we produced male and female embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines with stably-integrated shRNA constructs that simultaneously target both mH2A1 and mH2A2. Surprisingly, we find that female ESCs deficient for both mH2A1 and mH2A2 readily execute and maintain XCI upon differentiation. Furthermore, male and female mH2A-deficient ESCs proliferate normally under pluripotency culture conditions, and respond to several standard differentiation procedures efficiently. Our results show that XCI can readily proceed with substantially reduced total mH2A content."

Both animals carry a glycine to arginine substitution at position 185 in the iron transporter known as Nramp2/DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1). DMT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression has been examined in the gastrointestinal tract of mk mice. Northern blot analysis indicates that, by comparison to mk/+ heterozygotes, mk/mk homozygotes show a dramatic increase in the level of DMT1 mRNA in the duodenum. This increase in RNA expression is paralleled by a concomitant increase of the 100-kd DMT1 isoform I protein expression in the duodenum. Immunohistochemical analyses show that, as for normal mice on a low-iron diet, DMT1 expression in enterocytes of mk/mk mice is restricted to the duodenum. However, and in contrast to normal enterocytes, little if any expression of DMT1 is seen at the apical membrane in mk/mk mice. These results suggest that the G185R mutation, which was shown to impair the transport properties of DMT1, also affects the membrane targeting of the protein in mk/mk enterocytes. This loss of function of DMT1 is paralleled by a dramatic increase in expression of the defective protein in mk/mk mice. This is consistent with a feedback regulation of DMT1 expression by iron stores. (Blood. 2000;96:3964-3970)"

Dysfunction of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG)-encoded rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel (IKr) is a major cause of LQTS. The expression of hERG channels is controlled by anterograde trafficking of newly synthesized channels to and retrograde degradation of existing channels from the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2) targets the PY motif of hERG channels to initiate channel degradation. Although both immature and mature hERG channels contain the PY motif, Nedd4-2 selectively mediates the degradation of mature hERG channels. In the present study, we demonstrate that Nedd4-2 is directed to specific cellular compartments by the Nedd4 family interacting proteins, Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) and Ndfip2. Ndfip1 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus where it recruits Nedd4-2 to mediate the degradation of mature hERG proteins during channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Although Ndfip2 directs Nedd4-2 to the Golgi apparatus, it also recruits Nedd4-2 to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which may impair MVB function and impede the degradation of mature hERG proteins mediated by Nedd4-2. These findings extend our understanding of hERG channel regulation and provide information which may be useful for the rescue of impaired hERG function in LQTS. "

We present the structure of the histone H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product. We therefore predict that other enzymes are responsible for the tri-methylation of histone H4K20 that marks silenced heterochromatin. "

Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences. "

The radiotherapy techniques compared were conventional photon therapy, intensity modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT), conventional electron therapy, intensity/energy modulated electron therapy (IMET) and proton therapy (IMPT).CT images for radiotherapy use from five children, median age 8 and diagnosed with medulloblastoma, were selected for this study. Target volumes and organs at risk were defined in 3-D. Treatment plans using conventional photon therapy, IMXT, conventional electron therapy, IMET and IMPT were set up. The probability of normal tissue complication (NTCP) and the risk of cancer induction were calculated using models with parameters-sets taken from published data for the general population; dose data were taken from dose volume histograms (DVH). Similar dose distributions in the targets were achieved with all techniques but the absorbed doses in the organs-at-risk varied significantly between the different techniques. The NTCP models based on available data predicted very low probabilities for side-effects in all cases. However, the effective mean doses outside the target volumes, and thus the predicted risk of cancer induction, varied significantly between the techniques. The highest lifetime risk of secondary cancers was estimated for IMXT (30%). The lowest risk was found with IMPT (4%). The risks associated with conventional photon therapy, electron therapy and IMET were 20%, 21% and 15%, respectively. This model study shows that spinal irradiation of young children with photon and electron techniques results in a substantial risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers. Multiple beam IMXT seems to be associated with a particularly high risk of secondary cancer induction. To minimise this risk, IMPT should be the treatment of choice. If proton therapy is not available, advanced electron therapy may provide a better alternative."

Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks."

To date it is unclear if combined blocking of endothelin A/B receptors is necessary or whether selective inhibition of one of the ET-1 receptors is sufficient for the observed cardioprotection. Therefore, we investigated the impact of dual (bosentan) and single endothelin receptor antagonism through sitaxentan (receptor A blocker) or BQ788 (receptor B blocker) in a murine doxorubicin cardiotoxicity model (C57BL/6N). Simultaneous administration of each endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with doxorubicin resulted in a significantly improved hemodynamic performance in comparison to the impaired cardiac function in control mice with bosentan being most effective but closely followed by sitaxentan and also BQ788. This cardioprotection was not caused by diminished doxorubicin levels in heart since the doxorubicin content in cardiac tissue was not altered by ERAs significantly. However, whole transcript expression profiling showed partly different effects of the ERAs on doxorubicin-modulated cardiac gene expression of genes involved in signal transduction (e.g. Stat3, Pim1, Akt1, Plcb2), fibrosis (e.g. Myl4), energy production (e.g. Ant1) or oxidative stress (e.g. Aox1). Furthermore, doxorubicin-mediated gene regulations were verified in the murine cardiomyocyte model HL-1 showing partly reversed expression patterns after co-administration of the ERAs. In summary, our results demonstrate strong cardioprotective effects of blocking ET-1 receptors against the doxorubicin-related cardiomyopathy and provide evidence to potential underlying signaling pathways.

Here we show that haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. By combining analysis of Meis1 loss-of-function and conditional Meis1 functional rescue with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches we show that, in contrast to its preferential association with Hox-Pbx BSs in the trunk, Meis1 binds to Hox/Pbx-independent sites during optic cup development. In the eye primordium, Meis1 coordinates, in a dose-dependent manner, retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, Meis1 is required for eye patterning by controlling a set of eye territory-specific transcription factors, so that in Meis1(-/-) embryos boundaries among the different eye territories are shifted or blurred. We propose that Meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations. "

In contrast, phosphorylation is essential for performance of diverse noncanonical functions of AARSs unrelated to protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) has been investigated extensively in our laboratory for more than a decade, and has served as an archetype for studies of other AARSs. EPRS is a constituent of the IFN-\u03b3-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that directs transcript-selective translational control in myeloid cells. Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of EPRS is essential for its release from the parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), for binding to other GAIT complex proteins, and for regulating the binding to target mRNAs. Importantly, phosphorylation is the common driving force for the context- and stimulus-dependent release, and non-canonical activity, of other AARSs residing in the MSC, for example, lysyl tRNA synthetase (KARS). Here, we describe the concepts and experimental methodologies we have used to investigate the influence of phosphorylation on the structure and function of EPRS. We suggest that application of these approaches will help to identify new functional phosphorylation event(s) in other AARSs and elucidate their possible roles in noncanonical activities."

On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specific T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine."

Such operon-like gene clusters are defined by their co-regulation or neighboring positions within immediate vicinity of chromosomal regions. A comprehensive analysis of the expression of neighboring genes therefore accounts a crucial step to reveal the complete set of operon-like gene clusters within a genome. Genome-wide prediction of operon-like gene clusters should contribute to functional annotation efforts and provide novel insight into evolutionary aspects acquiring certain biological functions as well. We predicted co-expressed gene clusters by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient of neighboring genes and randomly selected gene pairs, based on a statistical method that takes false discovery rate (FDR) into consideration for 1469 microarray gene expression datasets of A. thaliana. We estimated that A. thaliana contains 100 operon-like gene clusters in total. We predicted 34 statistically significant gene clusters consisting of 3 to 22 genes each, based on a stringent FDR threshold of 0.1. Functional relationships among genes in individual clusters were estimated by sequence similarity and functional annotation of genes. Duplicated gene pairs (determined based on BLAST with a cutoff of E<10(-5)) are included in 27 clusters. Five clusters are associated with metabolism, containing P450 genes restricted to the Brassica family and predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism. Operon-like clusters tend to include genes encoding bio-machinery associated with ribosomes, the ubiquitin/proteasome system, secondary metabolic pathways, lipid and fatty-acid metabolism, and the lipid transfer system."

At present, it is unknown how the PcG proteins are recruited to their target promoters in mammalian cells. Here we show that PRC2 forms a stable complex with the Jumonji- and ARID-domain-containing protein, JARID2 (ref. 4). Using genome-wide location analysis, we show that JARID2 binds to more than 90% of previously mapped PcG target genes. Notably, we show that JARID2 is sufficient to recruit PcG proteins to a heterologous promoter, and that inhibition of JARID2 expression leads to a major loss of PcG binding and to a reduction of H3K27me3 levels on target genes. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development."

In addition, we can no longer consider white adipose tissue as a single tissue, because it shows different metabolic profiles in its different locations, with also different implications. Although the characteristic cell of adipose tissue is the adipocyte, this is not the only cell type present in adipose tissue, neither the most abundant. Other cell types in adipose tissue described include stem cells, preadipocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The balance between these different cell types and their expression profile is closely related to maintenance of energy homeostasis. Increases in adipocyte size, number and type of lymphocytes, and infiltrated macrophages are closely related to the metabolic syndrome diseases.

Rarer genetic causes of ALS include mutation of optineurin (mt OPTN). Furthermore, optineurin protein has been localized to the ubiquitylated aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. This study: (i) investigated the frequency of mt OPTN in ALS patients in England; (ii) characterized the clinical and neuropathological features of ALS associated with a mt OPTN; and (iii) investigated optineurin neuropathology in C9ORF72-related ALS (C9ORF72-ALS). We identified a heterozygous p.E322K missense mutation in exon 10 of OPTN in one familial ALS patient who additionally had a C9ORF72 mutation. This patient had bulbar, limb and respiratory disease without cognitive problems. Neuropathology revealed motor neurone loss, trans-activation response DNA protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions together with TDP-43-negative neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in extra motor regions that are characteristic of C9ORF72-ALS. We have demonstrated that both TDP-43-positive and negative inclusion types had positive staining for optineurin by immunohistochemistry. We went on to show that optineurin was present in TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic extra motor inclusions in C9ORF72-ALS cases that do not carry mt OPTN. We conclude that: (i) OPTN mutations are associated with ALS; (ii) optineurin protein is present in a subset of the extramotor inclusions of C9ORF72-ALS; (iii) It is not uncommon for multiple ALS-causing mutations to occur in the same patient; and (iv) studies of optineurin are likely to provide useful dataregarding the pathophysiology of ALS and neurodegeneration.

Because muscle fibers display very different metabolic properties and insulin sensitivity, we tested the hypothesis that musclin expression could depend on myofiber type. Musclin mRNA was detected at high level in fast gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, but only as traces in soleus, a slow-twitch muscle. A single fiber analysis showed that musclin was produced by muscle fibers themselves, almost exclusively type IIb fibers. Slow to fast transition of soleus phenotype after hindlimb suspension increased musclin mRNA levels, whereas fast to slow transition of plantaris phenotype after functional overload decreased musclin mRNA levels. This clearly suggests that musclin transcription is strongly related to fast-glycolytic phenotype. We conclude that musclin is produced by myocytes in a highly fiber-type specific manner and that physiological changes in type IIb MHC lead to coordinated musclin expression."

Each deficiency is associated with a characteristic increase in haem precursors that correlates with the symptoms associated with individual porphyrias and allows accurate diagnosis. Two types of clinical presentation occur separately or in combination; acute life-threatening neurovisceral attacks and/or cutaneous symptoms. Five of the porphyrias are low-penetrance autosomal dominant conditions in which clinical expression results from additional factors that act by increasing demand for haem or by causing an additional decrease in enzyme activity or by a combination of these effects. These include both genetic and environmental factors. In familial porphyria cutanea tarda (PCTF), environmental factors that include alcohol, exogenous oestrogens and hepatotropic viruses result in inhibition of hepatic enzyme activity via a mechanism that involves excess iron accumulation. In erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), co-inheritance of a functional polymorphism in trans to a null ferrochelatase allele accounts for most clinically overt cases. In the autosomal dominant acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria), acute neurovisceral attacks occur in a minority of those who inherit one of these disorders. Although various exogenous (e.g. drugs, alcohol) and endogenous factors (e.g. hormones) have been identified as provoking acute attacks, these do not provide a full explanation for the low penetrance of these disorders. It seems probable that genetic background influences susceptibility to acute attacks, but the genes that are involved have not yet been identified."

In this study, in order to further clarify the pathogenesis of OPA, we investigated whether goats are resistant to JSRV replication and carcinogenesis. We found that JSRV induces lung tumors in goats with macroscopic and histopathological features that dramatically differ from those in sheep. However, the origins of the tumor cells in the two species are identical. Interestingly, in experimentally infected lambs and goat kids, we revealed major differences in the number of virus-infected cells at early stages of infection. These differences were not related to the number of available target cells for virus infection and cell transformation or the presence of a host-specific immune response toward JSRV. Indeed, we also found that goats possess transcriptionally active endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) that likely influence the host immune response toward the exogenous JSRV. Overall, these results suggest that goat cells, or at least those cells targeted for viral carcinogenesis, are not permissive to virus replication but can be transformed by JSRV. "

Thalassemia major is severe anemia necessitating chronic blood transfusions, splenectomy, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Usually thalassemia major results from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for severe betaO- and/or beta+-thalassemia mutations. Thalassemia intermedia is a clinical diagnosis that describes a symptomatic but less severe condition than beta-thalassemia major. beta-thalassemia intermedia may arise from several different combinations of alpha- and/or beta-thalassemia mutations. Heterozygous beta-thalassemia is typically characterized by a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia without any significant clinical implications. In this report, we describe a 63-year-old Africian American woman with asymptomatic homozygous beta-thalassemia, who seems to carry 2 copies of the -29 mutation in the promoter region of the beta-globin gene. Her elevated hemoglobin F level of 83% was associated with heterozygosity for the Xmn I polymorphism upstream of the Ggamma-globin gene. Southern blot analysis at the alpha-globin locus did not show any deletion that would account for the mildness of her phenotype. Therefore, homozygosity for the -29 mutation along with the Xmn I polymorphism appears to confer an extremely mild beta-thalassemia phenotype. This observation has important implications in the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of families segregating this type of genetic defect."

Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2). In replicative intermediates, nucleosomes are present in the unreplicated parental stem with the replication fork possibly penetrating into the nucleosomal DNA before the histone octamer is removed. Nucleosomes reassociate on the newly replicated DNA branches at distances from the branch point of 225 ( +/- 145) nucleotides on the leading strand and of 285( +/- 120) nucleotides on the lagging strand. In the presence of cycloheximide, daughter duplexes contained unequal numbers of nucleosomes, supporting dispersive and random segregation of parental nucleosomes. These were arranged in clusters with normal nucleosome spacing. We detected a novel type of interlocked dimer comprising two fully replicated molecules connected by a single-stranded DNA bridge. We cannot decide whether these dimers represent hemicatenanes or whether the two circles are joined by a Holliday-type structure. The joining site maps within the replication terminus.

The clinical symptoms include growth and mental retardation, microcephaly, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, hypotonia, and a high-pitched monochromatic cry that is usually considered diagnostic for the syndrome. Recently, a correlation between clinical features and the extent of the chromosome 5 deletions has identified two regions of the short arm that appear to be critical for the abnormal development manifested in this syndrome. Loss of a small region in 5p15.2 correlates with all of the clinical features of cri-du-chat with the exception of the cat-like cry, which maps to 5p15.3. Here we report the construction of a YAC contig that spans the chromosomal region in 5p15.2 that plays a major role in the etiology of the cri-du-chat syndrome. YACs that span the 2-Mb cri-du-chat critical region have been identified and characterized. This YAC contig lays the groundwork for the construction of a transcriptional map of this region and the eventual identification of genes involved in the clinical features associated with the cri-du-chat syndrome. It also provides a new diagnostic tool for cri-du-chat in the shape of a YAC clone that may span the entire critical region."

Due to read length increases, algorithm improvements and hybrid assembly approaches, the concept of one chromosome, one contig and automated finishing of microbial genomes is now a realistic and achievable task for many microbial laboratories. In this paper, we describe high quality sequence datasets which span three generations of sequencing technologies, containing six types of data from four NGS platforms and originating from a single microorganism, Clostridium autoethanogenum. The dataset reported here will be useful for the scientific community to evaluate upcoming NGS platforms, enabling comparison of existing and novel bioinformatics approaches and will encourage interest in the development of innovative experimental and computational methods for NGS data.

We have characterized this protein in human cultured primary human osteoblasts, in developing human neonatal bone, and in iliac crest bone biopsies from adult women. In vivo, Ostn expression was localized in developing human neonatal rib bone, with intense immunoreactivity in osteoblasts on bone-forming surfaces, in newly incorporated osteocytes, and in some late hypertrophic chondrocytes. In adult bone, Ostn expression was specifically localized to osteoblasts and young osteocytes at bone-forming sites. In vitro, Ostn expression decreased time dependently (p<0.02) in osteoblasts cultured for 2, 3, and 6 days. Expression was further decreased in cultures containing 200 nM hydrocortisone by 1.5-, 2.3-, and 3.1-fold (p<0.05) at the same time points. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase expression increased with osteoblast differentiation (p<0.05). Low-dose estradiol decreased Ostn expression time dependently (p<0.05), whereas Ostn expression in cultures treated with high-dose estradiol was not significantly changed. These results demonstrate that Ostn is expressed in human skeletal tissue, particularly in osteoblasts in developing bone and at sites of bone remodeling, suggesting a role in bone formation. Thus, Ostn provides a marker of osteoblast lineage cells and appears to correlate with osteoblast activity."

The study included 787 CRC patients and 551 healthy controls. The study comprised of a training set (520 cases and 341 controls) and a replication set (267 cases and 210 controls). We observed associations in rs7849 and rs1399685 with CRC risk. For example, a dose-dependent trend (per-allele odds ratio (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-1.00; P for trend = 0.05) associated with the variant allele of rs7849 in the training set. The significant trend toward a decrease in CRC risk was confirmed in the replication set (per-allele OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; P for trend = 0.044). When stratified by tumor location, for left-sided CRC (LCRC) risk, significant association was observed for the variant-containing genotypes of rs1399685 (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.02-3.06) and the risk was replicated in the replication population (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.02-4.07). The variant genotypes of rs9784100 and rs7849 conferred decreased risk but the associations were not replicated. Three right-sided CRC (RCRC) susceptibility loci were identified in rs6124509, rs4243289 and rs12218935 but none of the loci was replicated. Joint effects and potential higher order gene-gene interactions among significant variants further categorized patients into different risk groups. Our results strongly suggest that several genetic variants in the UCEs may contribute to CRC susceptibility, individually and jointly, and that different genetic etiology may be involved in RCRC and LCRC."

Using the 11 HapMap populations as the comparison group, we found Wolaita-specific signals of recent positive selection in several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci. Notably, the selected loci overlapped with HLA regions that we previously reported to be associated with podoconiosis-a geochemical lymphedema of the lower legs common in the Wolaita area. We found selection signals in PPARA, a gene involved in energy metabolism during prolonged food deficiency. This finding is consistent with the dietary use of enset, a crop with high-carbohydrate and low-fat and -protein contents domesticated in Ethiopia subsequent to food deprivation 10\u2009000 years ago, and with metabolic adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. We observed novel selection signals in CDKAL1 and NEGR1, well-known diabetes and obesity susceptibility genes. Finally, the SLC24A5 gene locus known to be associated with skin pigmentation was in the top selection signals in the Wolaita, and the alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1426654 and rs1834640 (SLC24A5) associated with light skin pigmentation in Eurasian populations were of high frequency (47.9%) in this Omotic-speaking indigenous Ethiopian population."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are universally expressed noncoding RNA species that have been proposed recently to regulate the expression of their parental genes. In the present study, the deep RNA-sequencing technique known as RNA-seq was used to compare expression profiles of circRNAs from 2 pooled RNA samples from cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum and to identify the key circRNAs involved in lactation. A total of 4,804 and 4,048 circRNAs were identified in the cow mammary gland on d 90 and 250 postpartum, respectively, of which only 2,231 circRNAs were co-expressed at both lactation stages, suggesting high stage specificity in the circRNAs. The enrichment of some Gene Ontology terms for the circRNA parental genes differed between lactation stages. Among the top 10 enriched Gene Ontology terms, vesicle, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial lumen were more common on lactation d 90. All 4 casein-coding genes (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3) produced circRNAs in the cattle mammary gland. In total, 80 circRNAs were identified from these 4 genes; circRNAs from CSN1S1 had very high abundance, and 3 of them accounted for 36% of all the circRNAs expressed in the mammary gland on lactation d 90. Three circRNAs from CSN1S1, 1 circRNA from CSN1S2, and 1 circRNA from CSN2 were all more highly expressed on lactation d 90 than on lactation d 250, as confirmed by quantitative PCR. These circRNAs had several target sites for the microRNA miR-2284 family and were predicted to target CSN1S1 and CSN2 mRNA, suggesting their potential involvement in regulating expression of the casein genes.

To provide a basis for incisive analysis of those complexities and ambiguities and to guide development of new autophagy-targeted treatments for cancer, we have compiled a comprehensive, curated inventory of autophagy modulators by integrating information from published siRNA screens, multiple pathway analysis algorithms, and extensive, manually curated text-mining of the literature. The resulting inventory includes 739 proteins and 385 chemicals (including drugs, small molecules, and metabolites). Because autophagy is still at an early stage of investigation, we provide extensive analysis of our sources of information and their complex relationships with each other. We conclude with a discussion of novel strategies that could potentially be used to target autophagy for cancer therapy. "

One patient with ependymoma and another with anaplastic ependymoma are currently alive with no evidence of disease at 7 and 11 years after IORT, respectively. Symptomatic brain necrosis occurred in 3 patients following IORT, but the symptoms were relieved in 2 of them by the removal of necrotic brain tissue.

Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the safety of acupuncture at Fengchi. Laboratory tests and adverse event reports were used to evaluate the safety of different acupuncture manipulations for the treatment of posterior circulation ischemia with vertigo. A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to four groups. Verum acupuncture was conducted with different needle insertion directions (contralateral paropia or prominentia laryngea) and different needle twisting frequencies (60 or 120 times/minute) at Fengchi and matching acupoints (for example, Zhongwan [CV12], Qihai [CV6], Zusanli [ST36], and Fenglong [ST40]). The patients received 14 treatments over 3-4 weeks. Routine blood analysis, hepatic and renal function tests, urine and feces tests and electrocardiography were performed before the first treatment session and after the final session. Adverse events were recorded after every session. Of the 136 patients, 120 completed the study. There were no significant differences between pretreatment and posttreatment test results in any of the groups. Only five patients suffered from minor adverse events (needling pain, slight hematoma and transient chest tightness). No serious adverse events were found. Our results indicate that a 14-session course of needling at Fengchi is relatively safe for treating posterior circulation ischemia with vertigo. "

Unlike lesions generated by exogenous damage, natural barriers are encountered in every S phase. Like humans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a single Pif1 family DNA helicase, Pfh1. Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II. In addition, converged replication forks accumulated at all of these sites in the absence of Pfh1. The effects of Pfh1 on DNA replication are likely direct, as it had high binding to sites whose replication was impaired in its absence. Replication in the absence of Pfh1 resulted in DNA damage specifically at those sites that bound high levels of Pfh1 in wild-type cells and whose replication was slowed in its absence. Cells depleted of Pfh1 were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome component that stabilizes stalled forks. Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites."

Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. UVB was followed by an initial downregulation and a subsequent increase in Arg mRNA reaching five-fold baseline levels after 24 h. We conclude that UVA and UVB differentially modify the expression of PTKs in NHEK, and that Arg appears to have a major role in the response of keratinocytes to UV. These results provide a basis for further studies of PTK in UV-induced signaling that regulates protective responses, cell growth and carcinogenesis in the skin."

Interleukin (IL)-4 is a key cytokine which can exacerbate Th2 over-expression in addition to isotype switching to immunoglobin (Ig)G1 and IgG4 that are responsible for desmoglein loss. Elevation of IL-4 level has also been reported in various studies. Considering the important role of IL-4 in severe phase of pemphigus and lack of effective and safeness therapy for this potentially fatal disease, anti-IL-4 therapy was introduced as a potential curative for pemphigus disease. This study reviewed all studies about any roles of IL-4 that can directly and indirectly be played in the development of pemphigus and IL-4 inhibition with interferons and dupilumab therapy were introduced as a novel pemphigus treatment for patients who are in relapse phase of the disease. Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus. It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 \u03b1-chain receptor.

One mutant (asf1-33(ts)) was mated with mutants in 77 different kinase genes to identify synthetic lethal combinations. The asf1-33 mutant required the DNA damage checkpoint factors Chk1 and Rad3 for its survival at the restrictive temperature. Chk1, but not Cds1, was phosphorylated in the asf1-33 mutant at the restrictive temperature, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint was activated in the asf1-33 mutant. DNA damage occured in the asf1-33 mutant, with degradation of the chromosomal DNA observed through pulse-field gel electrophoresis and the formation of Rad22 foci. Sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in the asf1-33 mutant was increased compared to the asf1(+) strain at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that asf1 mutations also caused a defect in overall chromatin structure. The Asf1-33 mutant protein was mislocalized and incapable of binding histones. Furthermore, histone H3 levels at the centromeric outer repeat region were decreased in the asf1-33 mutant and heterochromatin structure was impaired. Finally, sim3, which encodes a CenH3 histone chaperone, was identified as a strong suppressor of the asf1-33 mutant. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that Asf1 plays an essential role in maintaining genomic stability in S. pombe."

These insertions can alter the dynamic of the neuronal transcriptome by changing the expression pattern of several nearby genes. The consequences of L1 genomic alterations in somatic cells are still under investigation, but the high level of mutagenesis within neurons suggests that each neuron is genetically unique.

After immunizing a llama with human PCSK9, we selected four sdAbs that bind PCSK9 with a high affinity and produced them as fusion proteins with a mouse Fc. All four sdAb-Fcs recognize the C-terminal Cys-His-rich domain of PCSK9. We performed multiple cellular assays and demonstrated that the selected sdAbs efficiently blocked PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation in cell lines, in human hepatocytes, and in mouse primary hepatocytes. We further showed that the sdAb-Fcs do not affect binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR but rather block its induced cellular LDLR degradation. Pcsk9 knock-out mice expressing a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene were generated, resulting in plasma levels of \u223c300 ng/ml human PCSK9. Mice were singly or doubly injected with the best sdAb-Fc and analyzed at day 4 or 11, respectively.

At 11 days, the equivalent values were 24 and 46% and \u223c2.3-fold higher LDLR proteins. These data constitute a proof-of-principle for the future usage of sdAbs as PCSK9-targeting drugs that can efficiently reduce LDL-cholesterol, and as tools to study the Cys-His-rich domain-dependent sorting the PCSK9-LDLR complex to lysosomes."

At 16 weeks in the two ESTEEM trials, apremilast reduced the severity and extent of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including nail, scalp and palmoplantar manifestations, versus placebo in adults, with these benefits generally being sustained over 52 weeks of treatment. Similarly, in three PALACE trials (PALACE 1-3), apremilast improved the signs and symptoms of PsA relative to placebo at 16 weeks in adults with active disease despite treatment with conventional synthetic and/or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. These PsA benefits were generally sustained for up to 104 weeks of treatment; skin involvement, enthesitis and dactylitis also improved with the drug. Apremilast was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being diarrhoea and nausea in the first year of treatment (usually occurring in the first 2 weeks after the first dose and resolving within 4 weeks) and nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection with continued treatment. Although further longer-term and comparative efficacy and tolerability data would be beneficial, the current clinical data indicate that apremilast is an effective and well tolerated option for the management of psoriasis and PsA in adults."

In the multicentre BOLT trial, the primary endpoint (i.e., an objective tumour response rate point estimate of \u226530\u00a0% and a 95\u00a0% confidence interval lower bound of >20\u00a0% in patients with fully assessable laBCC and all patients with metastatic BCC) was met at the primary analysis cut-off date (median follow-up 13.9\u00a0months) in the sonidegib 200\u00a0mg (36\u00a0% [95\u00a0% CI 24-50]) and 800\u00a0mg (34\u00a0% [95\u00a0% CI 25-43]) once-daily groups. Sonidegib 200\u00a0mg once daily (recommended dosage) had a better benefit-risk profile than the 800\u00a0mg dosage. Central review of the patients with laBCC in this population showed that 43\u00a0% achieved an objective response with sonidegib 200\u00a0mg once daily at the primary analysis date. Clinically meaningful responses were sustained in the sonidegib 200\u00a0mg group, based on an 18-month analysis. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild to moderate severity and manageable with dosage adjustments, concomitant medications and/or non-drug therapies (e.g., adequate hydration). The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

Photocross-linking was dependent upon the presence of SII, incorporation of 4-thio-UMP into RNA, and irradiation and was sensitive to treatment by RNase and proteinase. A transcriptionally active mutant of SII lacking the first 130 amino acids was also cross-linked to the nascent RNA, but SII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is inactive in concert with mammalian RNA polymerase II, failed to become photoaffinity labeled. SII-RNA contact was not detected after a labeled oligoribonucleotide was released from the complex by nascent RNA cleavage, demonstrating that this interaction takes place between elongation complex-associated but not free RNA. This shows that the 3'-end of RNA is near the SII binding site on RNA polymerase II and suggests that SII may activate the intrinsic RNA hydrolysis activity by positioning the transcript in the enzyme's active site."

Chromatins, prepared by reconstitution with either chicken or frog histones, were separately digested to mononucleosomes using either micrococcal nuclease (MNase) or caspase-activated DNase (CAD). Both enzymes preferentially cleave internucleosomal (linker) DNA, although they do so by markedly different mechanisms. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. Having identified the locations and quantified the strength of both the chicken or frog histone octamer binding sites on each DNA, the results obtained with the two enzymes were compared using a variety of criteria. Both enzymes displayed sequence specificity in their preferred cleavage sites, although the nature of this selectivity was distinct for the two enzymes. In addition, nucleosomes produced by CAD nuclease are 8-10 bp longer than those produced with MNase, with the CAD cleavage sites tending to be 4-5 bp further out from the nucleosomal dyad than the corresponding MNase cleavage sites. Despite these notable differences in cleavage behaviour, the two nucleases identified essentially equivalent patterns of nucleosome positioning sites on each of the DNAs tested, an observation that was independent of the histone type. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant."

Notably, NEMO was not recruited into the TNFR1 complex of DM cells, and consequently NF-\u03baB induction by TNF was severely impaired and DM cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell death. Interestingly, the TNF signaling defects can be fully rescued by reconstitution of DM cells with CYLD lacking ubiquitin hydrolase activity but not with CYLD mutated in TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) or NEMO binding sites.

In this regard, a fundamental question concerns the nature and mechanism of action of the accessory factors that are necessary and sufficient for, or enhance, transcription through nucleosomal arrays by RNA polymerase II. Here we describe a highly purified system that allows for efficient activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II from the promoter through several contiguous nucleosomes on defined chromatin templates. The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). As examples of the applicability of this system for mechanistic analyses of these and other factors, representative experiments show (i) that activated transcription from chromatin templates is concomitantly dependent on the activator, p300-mediated histone acetylation and elongation factor SII/TFIIS. (ii) that SII/TFIIS acts in a highly synergistic manner with p300 (and histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and (iii) that SII/TFIIS works directly at the elongation step of chromatin transcription. Here we describe purification methods for the different factors employed and the specific transcriptional assays that led to the above-mentioned conclusions. This purified system will be very useful as an assay system for the discovery of new factors or the mechanistic analysis of known or candidate factors involved in transcription initiation or elongation on chromatin templates, including factors that effect specific histone modifications or nucleosomal remodeling."

In recent decades, increasing evidence implicates the involvement of UCRs in carcinogenesis. The role of TUC.338 in cervical cancers was an oncogene in previous studies. Until now, the role of TUC.338 in colorectal cancers remains undefined. This study revealed that TUC.338 is significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) tissue and CRC cell lines, and the up-regulated TUC.338 is associated with lymph node metastasis. Transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines. TIMP-1 was demonstrated to be negatively regulated by TUC.338 at the posttranscriptional level, via a specific target site within the 3' untranslated region by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of TIMP-1 was also observed to inversely correlate with TUC.338 expression in CRC tissues. Over-expression of TIMP-1 with migRI-TIMP-1-GFP inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion and down-regulates MMP9, resembling that of TUC.338-siRNA. Thus, these findings suggested that TUC.338 acts as a novel oncogene by targeting the TIMP-1 gene thus promoting colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion."

Surprisingly, little is known about the biological significance or the mechanism of early centromere replication; however, the extensive conservation suggests that it is important for chromosome maintenance. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? In Candida albicans, a neocentromere contains an early firing origin, supporting the first hypothesis but not addressing whether the new origin is intrinsically early firing or whether the centromere influences replication time. Because the activation time of individual origins is not an intrinsic property of S. cerevisiae origins, but is influenced by surrounding sequences, we sought to test the hypothesis that centromeres influence replication time by moving a centromere to a late replication domain. We used a modified Meselson-Stahl density transfer assay to measure the kinetics of replication for regions of chromosome XIV in which either the functional centromere or a point-mutated version had been moved near origins that reside in a late replication region. We show that a functional centromere acts in cis over a distance as great as 19 kb to advance the initiation time of origins. Our results constitute a direct link between establishment of the kinetochore and the replication initiation machinery, and suggest that the proposed higher-order structure of the pericentric chromatin influences replication initiation."

The neurofibrillary tangles that define the neuropathology of PSP are comprised of aggregated 4R tau and show a well-defined distribution. Classically, PSP is diagnosed by symptoms that include progressive gait disturbance, early falls, vertical ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and fronto-subcortical dementia. There are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of this rapidly degenerating and debilitating disease. Davunetide is a novel neuroprotective peptide that is thought to impact neuronal integrity and cell survival through the stabilization of microtubules. Preclinical activity in models of tauopathy has been translated to clinical studies, demonstrating pharmacologic activity that has supported further development. Davunetide's efficacy and tolerability are being tested in a placebo-controlled study in PSP patients, making it the most advanced drug candidate in this indication. This review examines the disease characteristics of PSP, the rationale for treating PSP with davunetide and assesses some of the challenges of clinical trials in this patient population."

Globally, chromosomes are organized into active and inactive compartments while, at the gene level, looping interactions connect promoters to regulatory elements. Topologically associating domains (TADs), typically several hundred kilobases in size, form an intermediate level of organization. Major questions include how TADs are formed and how they are related to looping interactions between genes and regulatory elements. Here we performed a focused 5C analysis of a 2.8 Mb chromosome 7 region surrounding CFTR in a panel of cell types. We find that the same TAD boundaries are present in all cell types, indicating that TADs represent a universal chromosome architecture. Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In contrast, looping interactions between promoters and regulatory elements are cell-type specific and occur mostly within TADs. This is exemplified by the CFTR promoter that in different cell types interacts with distinct sets of distal cell-type-specific regulatory elements that are all located within the same TAD. Finally, we find that long-range associations between loci located in different TADs are also detected, but these display much lower interaction frequencies than looping interactions within TADs. Interestingly, interactions between TADs are also highly cell-type-specific and often involve loci clustered around TAD boundaries. These data point to key roles of invariant TAD boundaries in constraining as well as mediating cell-type-specific long-range interactions and gene regulation. "

Molecular targeted therapy holds the promise of providing new, more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity. However, the development of targeted therapy for gliomas has been particularly challenging. The oncogenetic process in such tumors is driven by several signaling pathways that are differentially activated or silenced with both parallel and converging complex interactions. Therefore, it has been difficult to identify prevalent targets that act as key promoters of oncogenesis and that can be successfully addressed by novel agents. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research. In this article, we seek to recapitulate the lessons learned in the development of targeted therapy for gliomas, including challenges and pitfalls in the interpretation of preclinical data, specific issues in glioma trial design, insights provided by translational research, changes in paradigms, and future perspectives."

The study was designed as multicenter, randomized phase II trial, preceded by a lead-in safety phase. The safety component reported here, which also investigated pharmacokinetics and preliminary clinical activity, required expansion and is therefore considered a phase I part to establish a recommended dosing regimen of the combination of CCNU (90-110 mg/m(2)) and dasatinib (100-200 mg daily). Overall, 28 patients were screened, and 26 patients were enrolled. Five dose levels were explored. DLTs, mainly myelosuppression, occurred in 10 patients. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was recorded in 7 patients (26.9%) and thrombocytopenia in 11 patients (42.3%). No significant effect of CCNU coadministration on dasatinib pharmacokinetics was found. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.35 months (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.4) and 6-month PFS was 7.7%. In this phase I study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of CCNU and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents."

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that IVIG has anti-amyloid and immune modulatory properties relevant to treating neurodegenerative disorders. In early stage AD clinical trials, IVIG was found to reduce cognitive decline and increase brain glucose metabolism. Unfortunately, IVIG failed to meet primary outcome objectives in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate AD. However, positive cognitive signals were observed in pre-planned subgroup analyses among APOE-\u03b54 carriers and moderately impaired AD patients. Biomarker studies revealed dose dependent increases in plasma and CSF immunoglobulins and decreases in beta amyloid-42 levels. In addition, IVIG treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated. These findings suggest that naturally occurring human anti-amyloid antibodies may play a physiologic role in the clearance of aggregated amyloid proteins. While the results of clinical trials to date do not provide support for the use of IVIG to treat AD at the doses tested, additional studies of IVIG's mechanisms are warranted and may guide the development of more effective therapies for AD in the future.

In addition, transcripts associated with immune-related signal transduction pathways, such as the toll-like receptor/NF-\u03ba\u03b2, and MAPK pathways were also found, as well as other immune genes previously identified in E. tasmanica's sister species, E. scolopes.

The fCNT/siRNA was well tolerated, and no toxicological consequences were observed in murine models. Toward clinical application of this platform, fCNTs were evaluated for the first time in nonhuman primates. The rapid and kidney-specific pharmacokinetic profile of fCNT in primates was comparable to what was observed in mice and suggests that this approach is amenable for use in humans.

The non cardioselective b\u00eata-blocker propranolol has been used in a pediatric setting for 40 years and, since 2008, has a new indication. A clearly significant improvement has been observed in the condition of children with complicated IH (10%) treated with propranolol. This new indication has been widely described in the international literature. Various explanations have been put forward for the mechanism of action including a vasoconstrictor, antiangiogenic and apoptotic effect of propranolol on the different cells making up an IH. Overall tolerance is good and the efficacy markedly superior to that of any other treatments used for this purpose. In conclusion, with its good tolerance profile and superior efficacy versus all the other available therapies, propranolol can be considered to be a first-line treatment for complicated IH."

The large size of the CEP290 gene prevents its use in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation therapy. Here, we show that targeted genomic deletion using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with LCA10 bearing the CEP290 splice mutation. We generated a cellular model of LCA10 by introducing the CEP290 splice mutation into 293FT cells and we showed that guide RNA pairs coupled with SpCas9 were highly efficient at removing the intronic splice mutation and restoring the expression of wild-type CEP290. In addition, we demonstrated that a dual AAV system could effectively delete an intronic fragment of the Cep290 gene in the mouse retina. To minimize the immune response to prolonged expression of SpCas9, we developed a self-limiting CRISPR/Cas9 system that minimizes the duration of SpCas9 expression. These results support further studies to determine the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies for the treatment of patients with LCA10."

Neurofibromin encoded by the NF1 causal gene regulates Ras/MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways. These signaling pathways play critical roles in controlling gene transcription during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA microarray analysis on the hippocampus of NF1(+/-) mice, the mouse model for NF1 learning disabilities. Our results indicated that genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes are dysregulated in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. Many of the NF1-affected genes play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, such as Rabs, synaptotagmins, NMDAR1, CaMKII, and CREB1. Because NF1-associated learning disabilities can be reversed by lovastatin, we also determined the effect of lovastatin treatment on genome-wide expression patterns of the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. We found that lovastatin altered the expression of a large number of genes, including those disturbed by NF1 mutations. Our results reveal a genome-wide overview of the molecular abnormalities in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus and should be useful for further identifying the novel molecular pathways that cause NF1 learning deficits."

Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes   150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression."

Target capture for vertebrate animals is currently dominated by two approaches-anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) and ultraconserved elements (UCE)-and both approaches have proven useful for addressing questions in phylogenomics, phylogeography and population genomics. However, these two sets of loci have minimal overlap with each other; moreover, they do not include many traditional loci that that have been used for phylogenetics. Here, we combine across UCE, AHE and traditional phylogenetic gene locus sets to generate the Squamate Conserved Loci set, a single integrated probe set that can generate high-quality and highly complete data across all three loci types. We use these probes to generate data for 44 phylogenetically disparate taxa that collectively span approximately 33% of terrestrial vertebrate diversity. Our results generated an average of 4.29\u00a0Mb across 4709 loci per individual, of which an average of 2.99\u00a0Mb was sequenced to high enough coverage (\u226510\u00d7) to use for population genetic analyses.

That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs).

Meanwhile, it has now become apparent that pediatric diffuse gliomas have a distinct genetic status from their adult counterparts, even though they share an indistinguishable histology. In pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas, an intragenic duplication of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB/MYBL1 were found recurrently and mutually exclusively. As for non-brainstem high-grade tumors, in addition to H3F3A, TP53, and ATRX mutations, which were frequently observed in older children, recurrent fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 were reported in infants younger than 3\u00a0years of age.

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop.

The interactome is regulated by PARP1 and its co-factor CTCF. They not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina. Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription. PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity. "

Recent work suggests that chronic alcohol treatment preferentially modulates both the expression and subcellular localization of NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit. Signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDARs has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders. NMDARs interact with a large number of proteins at the glutamate synapse, and a better understanding of how alcohol modulates this proteome is needed. We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes. Protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of post-synaptic proteins, including scaffolding, glutamate receptor and PDZ-domain binding proteins with GluN2B.

Here we illustrate an approach to combined physical and linkage mapping of type 1 anchor (gene) loci in the dog using information on syntenic homology from human and mouse, an interbreed cross/backcross, and a strategy for isolation of dog genomic clones containing both gene-specific sequences and simple sequence repeat polymorphisms. Eleven gene loci from human chromosome 17q (HSA17q) were mapped to the centromeric two-thirds of dog chromosome 9 (CFA9), an acrocentric chromosome of medium size: P4HB, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, BRCA1, RARA, THRA1, MPO, NF1, and CRYBA1. Eight of these were also positioned on a linkage map spanning 38.6 cM. Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere. Canine loci, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, THRA1, and RARA constitute a closely linked group near the centromeric end of CFA9, spanning a genetic distance of only 4.7 cM. Canine NF1 and CRYBA1 lie distally, near the lower border of the Giemsa band adjacent to the distal one-third of CFA9. NF1 and CRYBA1 are loosely linked to the more centromeric group (31.2 cM). No HSA17 genes were found on the telomeric one-third of CFA9. Painting of dog chromosomes with a human whole chromosome 17 probe showed hybridization with only the proximal two-thirds of CFA9, consistent with the conclusion that the distal one-third corresponds to a segment or segments of other human chromosomes. Two loci, GLUT4 and PMP22, located on HSA17p, were mapped by FISH to dog chromosome 5 in a region also identified by the whole human chromosome 17 paint, indicating disruption of HSA17 syntenic homology at the centromere."

The published data suggest that sponsors took decisions to move these compounds into Phase III on the basis of vastly limited data that were rife with type I error and probably driven by commercial concerns.

Here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal genes in their natural loci.

In March 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The properties of apremilast were evaluated to determine its specificity, effects on intracellular signaling, gene and protein expression, and in vivo pharmacology using models of innate and adaptive immunity. Apremilast inhibited PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2), with IC50 values in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit other PDEs, kinases, enzymes, or receptors. While both apremilast and thalidomide share a phthalimide ring structure, apremilast lacks the glutarimide ring and thus fails to bind to cereblon, the target of thalidomide action. In monocytes and T cells, apremilast elevated intracellular cAMP and induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase A substrates CREB and activating transcription factor-1 while inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of several genes induced via TLR4. Apremilast reduced interferon-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibited T-cell cytokine production, but had little effect on B-cell immunoglobulin secretion. In a transgenic T-cell and B-cell transfer murine model, apremilast (5mg/kg/day p.o.) did not affect clonal expansion of either T or B cells and had little or no effect on their expression of activation markers. The effect of apremilast on innate immunity was tested in the ferret lung neutrophilia model, which allows monitoring of the known PDE4 inhibitor gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Apremilast significantly inhibited lung neutrophilia at 1mg/kg, but did not induce significant emetic reflexes at doses <30 mg/kg. Overall, the pharmacological effects of apremilast are consistent with those of a targeted PDE4 inhibitor, with selective effects on innate immune responses and a wide therapeutic index compared to its gastrointestinal side effects."

Small speckles move in a directed way toward larger speckles with which they fuse. This directed movement is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels or inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. The random movement of speckles is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels, moderately reduced after inhibition of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and modestly increased upon inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. To define the paths through which speckles can translocate in the nucleus, we generated a pressure gradient to create flows in the nucleus. In response to the pressure gradient, speckles moved along curvilinear paths in the nucleus. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new type of ATP-dependent motion in the nucleus. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces."

Knock-down of PIAS1 expression in CA1 area by PIAS1 siRNA transfection impaired spatial learning and memory and decreased endogenous CREB SUMOylation. In addition, CREB SUMOylation was CREB phosphorylation dependent and lasted longer. Therefore, CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for signal transduction during the early phase of long-term memory formation, whereas CREB SUMOylation sustains long-term memory. "

The role of co-activators in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region (LCR)/\u03b2-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the \u03b2-globin promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down cells: LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the \u03b2-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin."

This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.

We have previously reported that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells and plays a role in cisplatin resistance. Here, we find out a novel relationship between the circadian transcription factor Clock and drug resistance. Clock drives the periodical expression of many genes that regulate hormone release, cell division, sleep-awake cycle and tumor growth. We demonstrate that ATF4 is a direct target of Clock, and that Clock is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, Clock expression significantly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity, and that the downregulation of either Clock or ATF4 confers sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin and etoposide. Notably, ATF4-overexpressing cells show multidrug resistance and marked elevation of intracellular glutathione. The microarray study reveals that genes for glutathione metabolism are generally downregulated by the knockdown of ATF4 expression. These results suggest that the Clock and ATF4 transcription system might play an important role in multidrug resistance through glutathione-dependent redox system, and also indicate that physiological potentials of Clock-controlled redox system might be important to better understand the oxidative stress-associated disorders including cancer and systemic chronotherapy."

Prolactin is produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary.The main role of prolactin is associated with mamotrophic action and lactogenesis. Hyperprolactinaemia causes several symptoms such as menstrual disorders, infertility, decrease of sexual function, galactorrhea in women and gynecomasty, impotence and decrease of semen quality in men. Recent studies have presented prolactin as a homone involved in many metabolic processes. Long-term consequences of high prolactin serum concentration are related to higher risk of cardiovascular system disease, disturbances in lipid profile and immunological system. Hyperprolactiaemia causes decrease of bone mass density (BMD). High serum prolactin levels lead to increase of the risk of osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Decrease of BMD results from hypoestrogenism induced by hyperprolactinaemia and also by the direct negative influence of prolactin on bone. Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures. Important group of patients threatened by osteoporosis and bone fracture is constituted by women which use antipsychotic drugs (which induce hyperprolactinaemia). Hyperprolactinaemia diagnosed in patients should be treated as soon as possible. Hyperprolactinaemic patients should be diagnosed in the direction of osteopenia and osteoporosis. When diagnosis is confirmed proper treatment is indicated."

Our aim has been to test the MELD score as a prognostic tool in amyloidosis. We evaluated 128 patients, 46 with TTR-related amyloidosis and 82 with AL amyloidosis. All patients had a complete clinical and echocardiography evaluation; overall biohumoral assessment included troponin I, NT-proBNP, creatinine, total bilirubin and INR ratio. The study population was dichotomized at the 12 cut-off level of MELD scores; those with MELD score >12 had a lower survival compared to controls in the study cohort (40.7 vs 66.3\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Either as a continuous and dichotomized variable, MELD shows its independent prognostic value at multivariable analysis (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.199, 95\u00a0% CI 1.082-1.329; HR\u00a0=\u00a02.707, 95\u00a0% CI 1.075-6.817, respectively). MELD shows a lower prognostic sensitivity/specificity ratio than troponin I and NT-proBNP in the whole study population and AL subgroup, while in TTR patients MELD has a higher sensitivity/specificity ratio compared to troponin and NT-proBNP (ROC analysis-AUC: 0.853 vs 0.726 vs 0.659). MELD is able to predict prognosis in amyloidosis. A MELD score >12 selects a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of death. The predictive accuracy seems to be more evident in TTR patients in whom currently no effective scoring systems have been validated."

Here we have measured peptide deamidation and transamidation in the same reaction to reveal factors that affect the relative propensity for the two possible products. We report that the propensity for deamidation by TG2 is both substrate dependent and influenced by the reaction conditions. Direct deamidation is favored for poor substrates and at low concentrations of active TG2, while indirect deamidation (i.e. hydrolysis of transamidated product) can significantly contribute to the deamidation of good peptide substrates at higher enzyme concentrations. Further, we report for the first time that TG2 can hydrolyze iso-peptide bonds between two peptide substrates. This was observed also for gliadin peptides introducing a novel route for the generation of deamidated T cell epitopes in celiac disease."

The present study was planned to evaluate the role of inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 and its efficacy in augmenting salt tolerance in oat (Avena sativa) under NaCl stress (100mM). The physiological parameter such as shoot length, root length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight and relative water content (RWC) were remarkably higher in IG 3 inoculated plants in comparison to un-inoculated plants under NaCl stress. Similarly, the biochemical parameters such as proline content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed and found to be notably lesser in IG 3 inoculated oat plants in contrast to un-inoculated plants under salt stress. Inoculation of IG 3 strain to oat seedlings under salt stress positively modulated the expression profile of rbcL and WRKY1 genes. Root colonization of root surface and interior was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Due these outcomes, it could be implicated that inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 enhanced plant growth under salt stress condition. This study demonstrates that PGPR play an imperative function in stimulating salt tolerance in plants and can be used as biofertilizer to enhance growth of crops in saline areas."

AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting one-fifth of those aged over 85\u00a0years. Recent therapeutic approaches have been strongly influenced by five neuropathological hallmarks of AD: acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 plague), formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs), and neuroinflammation. The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Current AD medications, memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) alleviate some of these symptoms by enhancing cholinergic signaling, but they are not curative. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD. This article focuses on the current research in clinical trials targeting the neuropathological findings of AD including acetylcholine response, glutamate transmission, A\u03b2 clearance, tau protein deposits, and neuroinflammation. These investigations include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors, \u03b2-secretase (BACE) or \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, vaccines or antibodies targeting A\u03b2 clearance or tau protein, as well as anti-inflammation compounds. Ongoing Phase III clinical trials via passive immunotherapy against A\u03b2 peptides (crenezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab) seem to be promising. Using small molecules blocking 5-HT"

Our aim was to extensively review the roles of PGB and GBP in treating sciatica. The efficacy, side effects (SE) profile and cost of PGB and GBP in neuropathic pain states were reviewed with special reference to sciatica. Eleven articles matched the criteria: seven systematic reviews, one retrospective cross-sectional study, one placebo-controlled-crossover study, one randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study and one case report. GBP and PGB appeared to demonstrate comparable efficacy and SE. However, the amount and quality of evidence was low, and only indirect comparisons were available. Importantly, no direct \"head-to-head\" study existed. Globally, costs varied widely (by up to 31 times) and unpredictably (PGB cheaper than GBP, or vice versa). Formulary regulator rulings were globally disparate; however, many exclusively favoured the more expensive drug (whether GBP or PGB). No studies assessed PGB-GBP interchange. Weak evidence suggests that efficacy and SE with GBP and PGB are probably similar; however, firm conclusions are precluded. Despite weak data, and having cited minor titration, but definite cost, advantages, UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence favoured PGB over GBP. Given that no evidence supports unhindered PGB-GBP interchange, neither drug should probably be favoured. Prospective \"head-to-head\" studies are urgently required to provide robust evidence-based knowledge for choice of GBP or PGB in sciatica."

Gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound. Their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins. Here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting. These results establish a biomolecular platform for the engineering of acoustic nanomaterials."

EPEC and C. rodentium type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors repress innate immune responses and infiltration of immune cells. Inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1 and caspase-4/11 are crucial mediators of host defense and inflammation in the gut via their ability to process cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Here we report that the effector NleF binds the catalytic domain of caspase-4 and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Following infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) EPEC inhibited caspase-4 and IL-18 processing in an NleF-dependent manner. Depletion of caspase-4 in IECs prevented the secretion of mature IL-18 in response to infection with EPEC\u0394nleF. NleF-dependent inhibition of caspase-11 in colons of mice prevented IL-18 secretion and neutrophil influx at early stages of C. rodentium infection. Neither wild-type C. rodentium nor C. rodentium\u0394nleF triggered neutrophil infiltration or IL-18 secretion in Cas11 or Casp1/11-deficient mice. Thus, IECs have a key role in modulating early innate immune responses in the gut via a caspase-4/11-IL-18 axis, which is targeted by virulence factors encoded by enteric pathogens."

The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new expectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival. The main objective is to improve median overall survival, which is currently between 9 and 12 months, with a good quality of life, measured by the ability to carry out daily life activities."

However, how MC1R activity is modulated by ultraviolet irradiation, why individuals with red hair are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit are unknown.

MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Nuclear organization has emerged as a key parameter in the formation of chromosomal translocations, yet little is known as to whether DNA repair can efficiently occur throughout the nucleus and whether it is affected by the location of the lesion. Here, we induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at different nuclear compartments and follow their fate. We demonstrate that DSBs induced at the nuclear membrane (but not at nuclear pores or nuclear interior) fail to rapidly activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair by homologous recombination (HR). Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus.

It is unknown whether these distinct protein assemblies are transported within and between neurons by similar or distinct mechanisms. It is also unclear if neuronal death or injury is required for neuron-to-neuron transfer. To address these questions, we used mouse primary cortical neurons grown in microfluidic devices to measure the amounts of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 fibrils transported by axons in both directions (anterograde and retrograde), as well as to examine the mechanism of their release from axons after anterograde transport. We observed that the three fibrils were transported in both anterograde and retrograde directions but with strikingly different efficiencies. The amount of A\u03b242 fibrils transported was ten times higher than that of the other two fibrils. HTTExon1 was efficiently transported in the retrograde direction but only marginally in the anterograde direction. Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons. In summary, fibrils of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 are all transported in axons but in directions and amounts that are specific of each fibril. After anterograde transport, the three fibrils were secreted in the medium in the absence of axon lysis. Continuous secretion could play an important role in the spread of pathology between neurons but may be amenable to pharmacological intervention. "

The design principle leverages the formation of aggregates through a top-down nanoparticle formulation to greatly stabilize the triplet excited states of a phosphorescent molecule. This prolongs the particle luminesce to the timescale that can be detected by the commercial whole-animal imaging system after removal of external light source. Such ultralong phosphorescent of OSNs is inert to oxygen and can be repeatedly activated, permitting imaging of lymph nodes in living mice with a high signal-to-noise ratio.

In the heart, fibrosis causes mechanical and electrical dysfunction and in the kidney, it predicts the onset of renal failure. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGF\u03b21 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. Here we show, using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGF\u03b21 exposure and required for its pro-fibrotic effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases."

Ischemia followed by reperfusion rapidly leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, which stimulate a complex cascade of events involving local endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and perivascular cells. A secondary response includes the release of other cytokines, an increase in components of the coagulation system, an upregulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, and changes in the expression of components of the immune response. The net effect of these events is transformation of the local endothelium to a prothrombotic/proinflammatory state and induction of leukocyte migration to the site of injury. A number of studies have shown that leukocyte migration occurs within hours of reperfusion. Leukocytes accumulate in the injured region, where they cause tissue injury by several mechanisms, including occlusion of microvasculature, generation of oxygen free radicals, release of cytotoxic enzymes, alteration of vasomotor reactivity, and increase in cytokine and chemoattractant release. Monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte adhesion molecules have been shown to reduce infarct volume in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion. However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. A number of factors may complicate the use of antibody directed adhesion molecule blockade in acute stroke and will be discussed in this article. Overall, an increased understanding of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms still offers great potential for reducing acute stroke injury."

Two reviewers independently screened the articles and extracted the data based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of included articles was evaluated by using Revman5.0, and meta-analysis was performed. The results showed that 1027 articles were obtained in initial retrieval, and finally 7 articles, involving a total of 4039 cases, were included for analysis. The meta-analysis showed that no significant differences were found in the long-term mortality (OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.09, P=0.30), the rate of dependency (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24, P=0.85), and the effective rate (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14, P=0.82) between citicoline group and control group. The overall rate of adverse events in citicoline group was not significantly different from that in control group (P=0.30). The quality of included articles reached moderate-low level.

As recombinant proteins are increasingly utilized as biotherapeutics, improved methodologies ensuring the characterization of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are needed. Typically, proteins prepared for PTM analysis are proteolytically digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To ensure full coverage of the PTMs on a given protein, one must obtain complete sequence coverage of the protein, which is often quite challenging. The objective of the research described here is to design a protocol that maximizes protein sequence coverage and enables detection of post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation. To achieve this objective, a highly efficient proteolytic digest protocol using trypsin was designed by comparing the relative merits of denaturing agents (urea and Rapigest SF), reducing agents [dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phophine (TCEP)], and various concentrations of alkylating agent [iodoacetamide (IAM)]. After analysis of human apo-transferrin using various protease digestion protocols, ideal conditions were determined to contain 6 M urea for denaturation, 5 mM TCEP for reduction, 10 mM IAM for alkylation, and 10 mM DTT, to quench excess IAM before the addition of trypsin. This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein. These digestion conditions were specifically designed for PTM analysis of recombinant proteins and biotherapeutics, and the work described herein fills an unmet need in the growing field of biopharmaceutical analysis."

CFS/ME is a complex, multi-system, chronic medical condition whose pathophysiology remains unknown. No established diagnostic tests exist nor are any FDA-approved drugs available for treatment. Because of the range of symptoms of CFS/ME, treatment approaches vary widely. Studies undertaken have heterogeneous designs and are limited by sample size, length of follow-up, applicability and methodological quality. The use of rintatolimod and rituximab as well as counselling, behavioural and rehabilitation therapy programs may be of benefit for CFS/ME, but the evidence of their effectiveness is still limited. Similarly, adaptive pacing appears to offer some benefits, but the results are debatable: so is the use of nutritional supplements, which may be of value to CFS/ME patients with biochemically proven deficiencies. To summarize, the recommended treatment strategies should include proper administration of nutritional supplements in CFS/ME patients with demonstrated deficiencies and personalized pacing programs to relieve symptoms and improve performance of daily activities, but a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation is required to confirm these preliminary observations. At present, no firm conclusions can be drawn because the few RCTs undertaken to date have been small-scale, with a high risk of bias, and have used different case definitions. Further, RCTs are now urgently needed with rigorous experimental designs and appropriate data analysis, focusing particularly on the comparison of outcomes measures according to clinical presentation, patient characteristics, case criteria and degree of disability (i.e. severely ill ME cases or bedridden)."

In particular, replication stress can explain the high prevalence of focal genomic deletions mapping within very large genes in human tumors. However, the origin of single-nucleotide substitutions (SNS) in nonfamilial cancers is strongly debated. Some argue that cancers have a mutator phenotype, whereas others argue that the normal DNA replication error rates are sufficient to explain the number of observed SNSs. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24, mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed SNS mutator phenotype."

Here we report the first direct radiocarbon date for the specimen and the genetic analyses of DNA extracted and sequenced from two areas of the bone. The new radiocarbon determination places the find to \u223c4500\u00a0cal BP (\u223c2500 BCE) contradicting an assumed Palaeolithic age of \u223c30,000 years, as originally suggested. The DNA retrieved from the specimen originates from a male individual who carried mitochondrial DNA of the modern human type. The petrous part yielded more endogenous ancient DNA molecules than the squamous part of the same bone. Molecular dating of the Darra-i-Kur mitochondrial DNA sequence corroborates the radiocarbon date and suggests that the specimen is younger than previously thought. Taken together, the results consolidate the fact that the human bone is not associated with the Pleistocene-age deposits of Darra-i-Kur; instead it is intrusive, possibly re-deposited from upper levels dating to much later periods (Neolithic). Despite its Holocene age, the Darra-i-Kur specimen is, so far, the first and only ancient human from Afghanistan whose DNA has been sequenced."

These \"large introns\" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. In invertebrates, especially Drosophila, it has been shown that larger introns can be spliced efficiently through a process known as recursive splicing-a consecutive splicing from the 5'-end at a series of combined donor-acceptor splice sites called RP-sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing. We analyzed over 15,000 non-redundant, large introns from six mammals, 1,600 from chicken and zebrafish, and 560 non-redundant large introns from five invertebrates. Our bioinformatic investigation demonstrates that, unlike the studied invertebrates, the studied vertebrate genomes contain consistently abundant amounts of direct and complementary strand interspersed repetitive elements (mainly SINEs and LINEs) that may form stems with each other in large introns. This examination showed that predicted stems are indeed abundant and stable in the large introns of mammals. We hypothesize that such stems with long loops within large introns allow intron splice sites to find each other more quickly by folding the intronic RNA upon itself at smaller intervals and, thus, reducing the distance between donor and acceptor sites."

Metastatic lung cancer cells can undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by various transcription factors, including a double-negative feedback loop between the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and ZEB1, but the precise mechanisms by which ZEB1-dependent EMT promotes malignancy remain largely undefined. Although the cell-intrinsic effects of EMT are important for tumor progression, the reciprocal dynamic crosstalk between mesenchymal cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is equally critical in regulating invasion and metastasis. Investigating the collaborative effect of EMT and ECM in the metastatic process reveals increased collagen deposition in metastatic tumor tissues as a direct consequence of amplified collagen gene expression in ZEB1-activated mesenchymal lung cancer cells. In addition, collagen fibers in metastatic lung tumors exhibit greater linearity and organization as a result of collagen crosslinking by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes. Expression of the LOX and LOXL2 isoforms is directly regulated by miR-200 and ZEB1, respectively, and their upregulation in metastatic tumors and mesenchymal cell lines is coordinated to that of collagen. Functionally, LOXL2, as opposed to LOX, is the principal isoform that crosslinks and stabilizes insoluble collagen deposition in tumor tissues. In turn, focal adhesion formation and FAK/SRC signaling is activated in mesenchymal tumor cells by crosslinked collagen in the ECM. Our study is the first to validate direct regulation of LOX and LOXL2 by the miR-200/ZEB1 axis, defines a novel mechanism driving tumor metastasis, delineates collagen as a prognostic marker, and identifies LOXL2 as a potential therapeutic target against tumor progression."

Recently, we found that archaeal Pelota (aPelota) associates with archaeal elongation factor 1\u03b1 (aEF1\u03b1) to act in the mRNA surveillance pathway, which accounts for the lack of an Hbs1 ortholog in archaea. Here we present the complex structure of aPelota and GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 determined at 2.3-\u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals how GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 recognizes aPelota and how aPelota in turn stabilizes the GTP form of aEF1\u03b1. Combined with the functional analysis in yeast, the present results provide structural insights into the molecular interaction between eukaryotic Pelota and Hbs1. Strikingly, the aPelota\u00b7aEF1\u03b1 complex structurally resembles the tRNA\u00b7EF-Tu complex bound to the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the molecular mimicry of tRNA in the distorted \"A/T state\" conformation by Pelota enables the complex to efficiently detect and enter the empty A site of the stalled ribosome."

However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity. We thus demonstrate how specific mechanistic details encoded in CRMs can be revealed by modeling their evolution and fitting such models to multispecies data. "

As a transcription factor, p53 mainly exerts its tumor suppressive function through transcriptional regulation of many target genes. To maintain the proper function of p53, p53 protein level and activity are exquisitely controlled by a group of positive and negative regulators in cells. Thus, p53, its regulators, and regulated genes form a complicated p53 signaling network. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules. miRNAs play an important role in regulation of gene expression by blocking translational protein synthesis and/or degrading target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 and its network are regulated by miRNAs at multiple levels. Some miRNAs regulate the level and function of p53 through directly targeting p53, whereas some other miRNAs target regulators of p53, such as MDM2 and MDM4, to indirectly regulate the activity and function of p53. On the other hand, p53 also regulates the transcriptional expression and the biogenesis of a group of miRNAs, which contributes to the tumor suppressive function of p53. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Many tumor-associated mutant p53, which have \"gain-of-function\" activities in tumorigenesis independently of wild type p53, can regulate the expression of different miRNAs and modulate the biogenesis of specific miRNAs to promote tumorigenesis. These findings have demonstrated that miRNAs are important regulators and mediators of p53 and its signaling pathway, which highlights a pivotal role of miRNAs in the p53 network and cancer. J. Cell.

Inflammatory markers are particularly suited for biomarker discovery as TBI leads to very early alterations in inflammatory proteins. Using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay, we measured in patients that had suffered mild TBI (n\u2009=\u200910) or severe TBI (n\u2009=\u200910) with extra-cranial injury or extracranial injury only (EC) (n\u2009=\u200910), 92 inflammation-associated proteins in serum obtained: <1\u2009hr (within 1-hour), 4-12\u2009hr and 48-72\u2009hr post injury. Changes were compared to healthy volunteers (HV). Our results identified CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL as novel early biomarkers of TBI. CST5 identified patients with severe TBI from all other cohorts and importantly was able to do so within the first hour of injury. AXIN1 and TRAIL were able to discriminate between TBI and HV at <1\u2009hr.

Instead, it provides infants a rich source of diverse bacteria, particularly microbes belonging to the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas genera. Very little is known about factors that influence variation in the milk microbiome among women and populations, although time postpartum, delivery mode, and maternal factors such as diet and antibiotic use might be important. The origins of the bacteria in milk are thought to include the maternal gastrointestinal tract (via an entero-mammary pathway) and through bacterial exposure of the breast during nursing. Currently, almost nothing is known about whether variation in microbe consumption by the infant via human milk and that of the mammary gland, itself, impacts short-term and/or long-term infant and maternal health although several studies suggest this is likely. We urge the clinical and public health communities to be patient, however, in order to allow human milk and lactation researchers to first understand what constitutes 'normal' in terms of the milk microbiome (as well as factors that impact microbial community structure) prior to jumping the gun to investigate if and how this important source of microbes impacts maternal and infant health."

Moreover, it appears to reduce the risk of premenopausal breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In the neonate and infant, among other benefits, lactation confers protection from future both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Whether lactation protects women with gestational diabetes mellitus and their offspring from future T2DM remains to be answered. Importantly, for diabetic mothers, antidiabetic treatment itself may affect breastfeeding. There is not enough data to allow the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Therefore, insulin currently remains the optimal antidiabetic treatment during lactation. In conclusion, breastfeeding could be considered a modifiable risk factor for the development of diabetes and even a potential protective lifestyle measure from future cardio-metabolic and malignant diseases. Therefore, health care professionals should encourage both women with and without diabetes to breastfeed their children."

To investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012.

Several studies provide support for the view that the enteric microbiome influences behavior through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship. Finally, and drawing on these independent lines of research, an integrative conceptual model is proposed in which stress-induced enteric dysbiosis and intestinal permeability confer risk for negative mental health outcomes through immunoregulatory, endocrinal, and neural pathways.

However, the effects of WGD and subsequent gene loss on cellular behavior and metabolism are still poorly understood. Here we develop a genome scale evolutionary model to study the dynamics of gene loss and metabolic adaptation after WGD. Using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example, we primarily study the outcome of WGD on yeast as it currently is. However, similar results were obtained using a recontructed hypothetical metabolic network of the pre-WGD ancestor. We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral WGD in S. cerevisiae. Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after WGD and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after WGD. Furthermore, the model shows that WGD leads to better adaptation than small-scale duplications, in environments for which duplication of a whole pathway instead of single reactions is needed to increase fitness. This is indeed the case for adaptation to high glucose levels. Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that WGD has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. Moreover, the model shows that WGD is almost always detrimental on the short term in environments to which the lineage is preadapted, but can have immediate fitness benefits in \"new\" environments. This explains why WGD, while pivotal in the evolution of many lineages and an apparent \"easy\" genetic operator, occurs relatively rarely."

Ty eccDNA can arise from the circularization of extrachromosomal linear DNA during the transpositional life cycle of retrotransposons, or from circularization of genomic Ty DNA. Circularization may happen through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) of long terminal repeats (LTRs) flanking Ty elements, by Ty autointegration, or by LTR-LTR recombination. By performing an in-depth investigation of sequence reads stemming from Ty eccDNAs obtained from populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, we find that eccDNAs predominantly correspond to full-length Ty1 elements. Analyses of sequence junctions reveal no signs of NHEJ or autointegration events. We detect recombination junctions that are consistent with yeast Ty eccDNAs being generated through recombination events within the genome. This opens the possibility that retrotransposable elements could move around in the genome without an RNA intermediate directly through DNA circularization. "

Consistent with a role for inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia."

In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to fluoxetine for six weeks. Patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 6. Probable clinical and laboratory adverse events were also monitored and compared between the two groups. Simvastatin-treated patients experienced significantly more reductions in HDRS scores compared to the placebo group by the end of the trial (p=0.02). Early improvement and response rates were significantly greater in the simvastatin group than the placebo group (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively) but remission rate was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.36). No serious adverse event was reported during this trial. In conclusion, simvastatin seems to be a safe and effective adjuvant therapy for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. However, more confirmatory studies are warranted. "

The results from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that IBD has a broader range of action through suppression of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20116, IL\u20111\u03b2, TNF\u2011\u03b1), toll\u2011like receptor 4 blockade (TLR\u20114), inhibition of a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), up\u2011regulation the anti\u2011inflammatory cytokine (IL\u201110), and promotion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NGF, NT\u20114). Recent data indicate that the efficacy of IBD appears to be independent from PDE inhibition activity and rather linked to glial activity attenuation. Additional advantages of IBD, such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, good tolerance and activity by oral administration, makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for treating neuroinflammatory conditions, where the currently available treatment remains unsatisfying due to poor tolerability and/or sub\u2011optimal efficacy. IBD has no direct receptor affinity with exemption of some undefined effect on adenosine receptors that makes the drug devoid of its receptors\u2011mediated adverse effects.

Urinary elimination (59%) was major by the i.v. route, whereas fecal elimination (53%) pre-dominated via the oral route. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was used for the analysis of plasma and bile samples due to the low level of radioactivity in samples (low specific activity of the doses). Unchanged GSK2140944 was the predominant circulating component (>60% DRM), with the main circulating metabolite M4 formed by oxidation of the triazaacenaphthylene moiety representing 10.8% (considered major) and 8.6% drug-related material by the oral and i.v. route, respectively. Approximately 50% of the oral dose was absorbed and eliminated mainly as unchanged GSK2140944 in urine (\u223c20% of dose). Elimination via metabolism (\u223c13% of dose) was relatively minor.

For example, the onset of inflammatory bowel disease is associated with enteric proteobacterial infection, yet the mechanistic basis for this association is unclear. We have shown previously that genetic defiency in TLR1 promotes acute enteric infection by the proteobacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. Examining that model further, we uncovered an altered cellular immune response that promotes the recruitment of neutrophils which in turn increases metabolism of the respiratory electron acceptor tetrathionate by Yersinia. These events drive permanent alterations in anti-commensal immunity, microbiota composition, and chronic inflammation, which persist long after Yersinia clearence. Deletion of the bacterial genes involved in tetrathionate respiration or treatment using targeted probiotics could prevent microbiota alterations and inflammation. Thus, acute infection can drive long term immune and microbiota alterations leading to chronic inflammatory disease in genetically predisposed individuals. "

Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile. This review aims to help in design of optimal checkpoint blocker combinations by discussing the mechanistic details and outlining the subtle differences between major checkpoints targeted for cancer immunotherapy."

Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients.

Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease."

It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification. In this Perspective, we discuss these breakthroughs, including their technical development, and applications that provide a global view of the many biological processes regulated by this important protein modification."

                    "context": "Context \u2022 Excoriation (skin picking) disorder is characterized by the need or urge to pick, scratch, pinch, touch, rub, scrub, squeeze, bite, or dig the skin, and it can be a perplexing condition for the inexperienced physician. Treatments include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies. Alternative therapies for excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors include yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol and N-acetylcysteine, among others. Objective \u2022 This review article intended to review the current literature on the alternative therapies to provide a brief update on their benefits for the treatment of excoriation disorder for use in conjunction with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the management of a challenging group of patients. Design \u2022 This review (focusing on literature published in the last 15 y, selected from a search of PubMed) critically considers the evidence for the use of alternative therapies in the treatment of excoriation disorder. Setting \u2022 This review was conducted at the National University of Asunci\u00f3n (San Lorenzo, Paraguay). Results \u2022 Results for yoga were as follows: This technique may influence the structure and functioning of the areas of emotional processing involved in the pathophysiology of excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. Although still limited, the current research team's use of yoga as a treatment has given useful results. Results for aerobic exercise were as follows: People suffering from excoriation disorder and other-body focused repetitive behaviors generally have a worsening of their behaviors in times of negative mood and anxiety. As exercise has qualities that allow individuals to improve their mood and reduce their anxiety, it is likely that it also can help reduce behaviors like hair pulling or scratching, and it should be considered to be an adjunctive therapy. Results for acupuncture were as follows: The mechanism of action of acupuncture increases serotonergic activity and releases endorphins in the hypothalamus and limbic region, which could be beneficial in patients with trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for biofeedback were as follows: Several case reports have suggested the value of biofeedback in reducing tics, which bear some psychophysiological similarities to body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for hypnosis were as follows: When used as a channel for other types of interventions, such as psychotherapy, hypnosis can help counteract the stress that triggers the picking behaviors in some patients. Results for inositol and N-acetylcysteine were as follows: Although more research is needed, these are promising drugs that may be helpful in reducing the picking behavior. Conclusions \u2022 The review indicates that yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol and N-acetylcysteine all show promise in the treatment of excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. In the current research team's experience, mainly yoga and aerobic exercise have been shown useful in combination with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Obtaining solid evidence about the long-term beneficial effects of these alternative therapies for the treatment of excoriation disorder requires more investigation."

Here, we identify TIAM1 as a critical antagonist of CRC progression through inhibiting TAZ and YAP, effectors of WNT signaling. We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity."

Royle, a rooted submerged perennial aquatic herb, is being developed as a potential tool to clean the aquatic ecosystem polluted by heavy metals. However, its physiological responses for heavy metal remain to be elucidated. Here, through employing proteomics approach, we found that excess Cu significantly induced the expressions of four DNA methylation related proteins in H. verticillata, which were the homologues of two domains rearranged methyltransferases (DRM), a methyltransferases chromomethylase (CMT) and a histone H3 lysine-9 specific SUVH6-like (SUVH6). Consistently, a dramatic change in DNA methylation patterns was detected in excess Cu-exposed H. verticillata. Surprisingly, administration of the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMZ) that block production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could trigger the remethylation of genomic sites that were demethylated by excess Cu, indicating that Cu-induced ROS might be another way to affect DNA methylation. Further analysis suggested this changed DNA methylation may be owing to the ROS-induced DNA damage. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that two different ways to influence DNA methylation in excess Cu-treated H. verticillata."

Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0 mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50 h following the first infusion, and 124 h following the fourth infusion. In summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity.

Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effect of simvastatin on aneurysmal SAH. We applied a random-effects model to calculate the data. Results Five RCTs involving 951 patients met the eligibility criteria. We found no statistically significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.49), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14), or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54). Subgroup analysis showed that these consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of treatment, and different courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity analysis showed that the STASH trial, which had a large population, did not influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes. Conclusions Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage."

Patients with < or =2 relapses and no prior anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy were treated with pazopanib 800 mg daily on 4-week cycles without planned interruptions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and clinical reassessment were made every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was efficacy as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). Thirty-five GBM patients with a median age of 53 years and median Karnofsky performance scale of 90 were accrued. Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), ALT elevation (n = 3), AST elevation (n = 1), CNS hemorrhage (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and thrombotic/embolic events (n = 3); 8 patients required dose reduction. Two patients had a partial radiographic response by standard bidimensional measurements, whereas 9 patients (6 at the 8-week point and 3 only within the first month of treatment) had decreased contrast enhancement, vasogenic edema, and mass effect but <50% reduction in tumor. The median PFS was 12 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-14 weeks) and only 1 patient had a PFS time > or =6 months (PFS6 = 3%). Thirty patients (86%) had died and median survival was 35 weeks (95% CI: 24-47 weeks). Pazopanib was reasonably well tolerated with a spectrum of toxicities similar to other anti-VEGF/VEGFR agents. Single-agent pazopanib did not prolong PFS in this patient population but showed in situ biological activity as demonstrated by radiographic responses. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00459381."

We identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that only 0.15% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism.

Despite the insertion of vast amounts of additional membrane, the phagosomal surface area remains approximately constant, implying active ongoing fission. To investigate the mechanisms underlying phagosomal fission we monitored the fate of Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR), which are known to be cleared from the phagosome during maturation. FcgammaR, which show a continuous distribution throughout the membrane of nascent phagosomes were found at later times to cluster into punctate, vesicular structures, before disappearing. In situ photoactivation of receptors tagged with a light-sensitive fluorescent protein revealed that some of these vesicles detach, whereas others remain associated with the phagosome. By fusing FcgammaR to pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins, we observed that the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors enters an acidic compartment, indicative of inward budding and formation of multivesicular structures. The topology of the receptor was confirmed by flow cytometry of purified phagosomes. Phagosomal proteins are ubiquitylated, and ubiquitylation was found to be required for formation of acidic multivesicular structures. Remarkably, proteasomal function is also involved in the vesiculation process. Preventing the generation of multivesicular structures did not impair the acquisition of late endosomal and lysosomal markers, indicating that phagosomal fusion and fission are controlled separately."

Expert commentary: We are experiencing a revolution in the understanding of the mechanism of AML. A majority of the effort has been concentrated on targeting gene mutations or pathway activations with precision therapeutics. Enasidenib is beneficial in a patient population that previously had limited treatment options. However, given the fact that enasidenib is a highly specific inhibitor of an early stable mutation, it is questionable whether a strategy of targeting a single mutation or pathway in relapsed AML will allow for better than the 20% complete remission (CR) rate observed with this therapy. The proper role for single mutation targeting in AML needs to be carefully considered."

However, for gelatin, problems associated with false-positive and false-negative results, inconsistencies and low reactivity of commercially available kits have been observed with regard to ELISA and PCR methods. Therefore we developed a selective bottom-up LC-MS methodology for quantitative gelatin species determination with a lower limit of quantification of 0.05%. The present article describes the validation of this method, which was performed according to Good Laboratory Practice, and the theoretical justification for bovine and porcine target selection. The validated method can be used to determine the purity of gelatin batches with regard to bovine and porcine constituents."

Intriguingly, >95% of cases carry the HLA-A29 allele, which defines the strongest documented HLA association for a human disease. We have conducted a genome-wide association study in 96 Dutch and 27 Spanish cases, and 398 unrelated Dutch and 380 Spanish controls. Fine-mapping the primary MHC association through high-resolution imputation at classical HLA loci, identified HLA-A*29:02 as the principal MHC association (odds ratio (OR) = 157.5, 95% CI 91.6-272.6, P = 6.6 \u00d7 10(-74)). We also identified two novel susceptibility loci at 5q15 near ERAP2 (rs7705093; OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.1, for the T allele, P = 8.6 \u00d7 10(-8)) and at 14q32.31 in the TECPR2 gene (rs150571175; OR = 6.1, 95% CI 3.2-11.7, for the A allele, P = 3.2 \u00d7 10(-8)). The association near ERAP2 was confirmed in an independent British case-control samples (combined meta-analysis P = 1.7 \u00d7 10(-9)). Functional analyses revealed that the risk allele of the polymorphism near ERAP2 is strongly associated with high mRNA and protein expression of ERAP2 in B cells. This study further defined an extremely strong MHC risk component in BSCR, and detected evidence for a novel disease mechanism that affects peptide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. "

The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antimyeloma activity. Twenty-eight patients, enrolled using a standard '3\u00a0+\u00a03' dose escalation, received one or two (n\u00a0=\u00a03) cycles of lucatumumab 1\u00b70, 3\u00b70, 4\u00b75 or 6\u00b70\u00a0mg/kg once weekly for 4\u00a0weeks. Common lucatumumab-related adverse events were reversible, mild-to-moderate infusion reactions. Severe adverse events were anaemia, chills, hypercalcaemia and pyrexia (7% each). DLTs included grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase and grade 4 increased lipase (n\u00a0=\u00a01 each). The MTD was 4\u00b75\u00a0mg/kg. At doses \u22653\u00b70\u00a0mg/kg, sustained receptor occupancy (\u226587%), observed throughout weekly infusions up to 5\u00a0weeks after the last infusion, correlated with an estimated half-life of 4-19\u00a0d. Twelve patients (43%) had stable disease, and one patient (4%) maintained a partial response for \u22658\u00a0months. These findings indicate that single-agent lucatumumab was well tolerated up to 4\u00b75\u00a0mg/kg with modest clinical activity in relapsed/refractory MM, warranting further study as a combination therapy."

One exemplar gene is HUWE1, which has been found to be mutated in numerous studies. However, due to the large size of this gene and a lack of functional analysis of identified mutations, their significance to carcinogenesis is unclear. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins."

To what extent epigenetic information on promoters of lineage-specification genes in human progenitors influences transcriptional activation and differentiation potential remains unclear. We produced bisulfite sequencing maps of DNA methylation in adipogenic, myogenic, and endothelial promoters in relation to gene expression and differentiation capacity, and unravel a similarity in DNA methylation profiles between MSCs isolated from human adipose tissue, bone marrow (BM), and muscle. This similarity is irrespective of promoter CpG content. Methylation patterns of MSCs are distinct from those of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and multipotent hESC-derived mesenchymal cells (MCs). Moreover, in vitro MSC differentiation does not affect lineage-specific promoter methylation states, arguing that these methylation patterns in differentiated cells are already established at the progenitor stage. Further, we find a correlation between lineage-specific promoter hypermethylation and lack of differentiation capacity toward that lineage, but no relationship between weak promoter methylation and capacity of transcriptional activation or differentiation. Thus, only part of the restriction in differentiation capacity of tissue-specific stem cells is programmed by promoter DNA methylation: hypermethylation seems to constitute a barrier to differentiation, however, no or weak methylation has no predictive value for differentiation potential."

By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier."

Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5\u00a0times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease."

                    "context": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques now allow relatively easy and affordable sequencing of large portions of the genome, even for nonmodel organisms. Many phylogenetic studies reduce costs by focusing their sequencing efforts on a selected set of targeted loci, commonly enriched using sequence capture. The advantage of this approach is that it recovers a consistent set of loci, each with high sequencing depth, which leads to more confidence in the assembly of target sequences. High sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies. Instead, many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the multispecies coalescent model. Our empirical analyses of ultraconserved element locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last 3 myr. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences."

Yeast and fungal prions are nonchromosomal genes composed of protein, generally an altered form of a protein that catalyzes the same alteration of the protein. Yeast prions are thus transmitted both vertically (as genes composed of protein) and horizontally (as infectious proteins, or prions). Formation of amyloids (linear ordered \u03b2-sheet-rich protein aggregates with \u03b2-strands perpendicular to the long axis of the filament) underlies most yeast and fungal prions, and a single prion protein can have any of several distinct self-propagating amyloid forms with different biological properties (prion variants). Here we review the mechanism of faithful templating of protein conformation, the biological roles of these prions, and their interactions with cellular chaperones, the Btn2 and Cur1 aggregate-handling systems, and other cellular factors governing prion generation and propagation. Human amyloidoses include the PrP-based prion conditions and many other, more common amyloid-based diseases, several of which show prion-like features. Yeast prions increasingly are serving as models for the understanding and treatment of many mammalian amyloidoses. Patients with different clinical pictures of the same amyloidosis may be the equivalent of yeasts with different prion variants."

At present, omalizumab is the only biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation. Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life.

Hamsters fed with Du-zhong leaf extract for 10 weeks showed a smaller size of epididymal adipocytes compared to the control group. The supplementation of the Du-zhong leaf extract significantly lowered the plasma levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non HDL-cholesterol, and free fatty acid, whereas it elevated the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio and apolipoprotein A-I levels. The hepatic cholesterol concentration was lower in the Du-zhong group than in the control group. The plasma total cholesterol concentration was positively correlated with hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity (r = 0.547, p < 0.05) and hepatic cholesterol concentration (r = 0.769, p < 0.001). The hepatic fatty acid synthase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were significantly lowered by a Du-zhong leaf extract supplement in high fat-fed hamsters. Hepatic fatty acid synthase activity was positively correlated with plasma fatty acid concentration (r = 0.513, p < 0.05) that was lower in the Du-zhong group. These results demonstrate that the Du-zhong leaf extract exhibits antihyperlipidemic properties by suppressing hepatic fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis with the simultaneous reduction of plasma and hepatic lipids in high fat-fed hamsters."

As reviewed in this article, all 4 antibodies have been proven effective, tolerable, and safe as migraine prophylactic treatments in phase II clinical trials. The mean decrease in migraine days per month was between 3.4 and 6.3\u00a0days/month after 8 to 12\u00a0weeks of treatment, and the placebo subtracted benefit ranged from 1 to 2.18\u00a0days. Notably, up to 32% of subjects experienced total migraine freedom after drug administration. Substance class-specific adverse events and treatment-related serious adverse event did not occur. Further long-term and large-scale trials are currently under way to verify the safety and efficacy profile of mAbs. In particular, the potential risk of vascular adverse events and the role of anti-drug antibodies deserve special attention. Anti-CGRP peptide and anti-CGRP receptor antibodies are the first effective treatments, which were specifically developed for the prevention of migraine. Their site of action in migraine prevention is most likely peripheral due to large molecule size, which prevents the penetration through the blood-brain barrier and thereby shows that peripheral components play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of a CNS disease."

Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission."

In experiment 1, 15 min prior to central fluid percussion brain injury, rats (n=8 per group) were injected (i.p.) with saline or diazepam (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg). Additional rats (n=8) were surgically prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Rats pre-treated with the 5 mg/kg dose of diazepam had significantly lower mortality (0%) than injured, saline-treated rats (53%). Also, diazepam-treated (5 mg/kg) rats had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze test performed 11-15 days post-injury. In experiment 2, at 15 min post-injury, rats were given either saline (n=5) or 5 mg/kg diazepam (n=6). Rats treated with diazepam did not differ in mortality from injured rats treated with vehicle. However, rats treated with diazepam at 15 min post-injury had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze than injured, vehicle-treated rats. In experiment 3, the post-injury administration of bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg, n=8), a GABA(A) antagonist, increased Morris water maze goal latencies compared to injured animals treated with saline (n=8). These results suggest that enhancing inhibitory function during the acute post-injury period produces beneficial effects on both survival and outcome following experimental TBI."

Plasma and urine samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included a subset of tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and nocturnal polysomnography. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was conducted on one CANTAB and one polysomnography parameter of interest. CEP-26401 was slowly absorbed (median tmax range 3-6 hours) and the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 24-60 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep, with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model, with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data. CEP-26401 was generally well tolerated up to 0.5\u2009mg/day with most common treatment related adverse events being headache and insomnia.

We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life."

Among several checkpoint receptors of immune cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), T-cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) are the most commonly targeted checkpoints for cancer immunotherapy. Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile. This review aims to help in design of optimal checkpoint blocker combinations by discussing the mechanistic details and outlining the subtle differences between major checkpoints targeted for cancer immunotherapy."

In our study, we found that the combination of a Met inhibitor, cabozantinib, and a novel FAK inhibitor, CT-707, exerted synergistic antitumor effects against hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo Interestingly, further studies showed that therapeutic concentrations of cabozantinib increased the phosphorylation of FAK, which might attenuate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib. The simultaneous exposure to CT-707 effectively inhibited the activation of FAK that was induced by cabozantinib, which contributes to the synergistic effect of the combination. Furthermore, cabozantinib increased the mRNA and protein levels of integrin \u03b15, which is a canonical upstream of FAK, and the introduction of cilengitide to block integrin function could abrogate FAK activation by cabozantinib, indicating that cabozantinib upregulated the phosphorylation of FAK in an integrin-dependent manner. Similar synergy was also observed on PHA-665752, another selective MET inhibitor, indicating that this observation might be a common characteristic of MET-targeting strategies. Our findings not only favor the development of the novel FAK inhibitor CT-707 as a therapeutic agent against hepatocellular carcinoma but also provide a new strategy of combining MET and FAK inhibitors to potentiate the anticancer activities of these two types of agents for treating hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

However, the precise role of BCL11B in humans is largely unexplored, except for a single patient with a BCL11B missense mutation, affected by multisystem anomalies and profound immune deficiency. Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes."

In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins."

Moloney leukemia virus 10 homolog (MOV10), a putative RNA helicase, has been implicated in inhibiting L1 replication, although its underlying mechanism of action remains obscure. Moreover, the physiological relevance of MOV10-mediated L1 regulation in human disease has not yet been examined. Using a proteomic approach, we identified RNASEH2 as a binding partner of MOV10. We show that MOV10 interacts with RNASEH2, and their interplay is crucial for restricting L1 retrotransposition. RNASEH2 and MOV10 co-localize in the nucleus, and RNASEH2 binds to L1 RNAs in a MOV10-dependent manner. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of either RNASEH2A or MOV10 results in an accumulation of L1-specific RNA-DNA hybrids, suggesting they contribute to prevent formation of vital L1 heteroduplexes during retrotransposition. Furthermore, we show that RNASEH2-MOV10-mediated L1 restriction downregulates expression of the rheumatoid arthritis-associated inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading proteinases in synovial cells, implicating a potential causal relationship between them and disease development in terms of disease predisposition."

There are very few reports available, where expressions of sirtuin isoforms are comprehensively analyzed during neoplasia. Therefore, in the present study, the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 during different stages of cervical cancer progression was analyzed. The normal cervical epithelium showed feeble expression of sirtuin isoforms, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7. A significant increase in SIRT1 expression was noted in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of proliferative layers of cervical epithelium in squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL); however, in the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), a heterogeneous pattern of SIRT1 expression varying from low to high was noted. A progressive increase in the expression of both SIRT2 and SIRT7 was noted during cancer progression in the following order: normal\u2009<\u2009preneoplasia\u2009<\u2009cancer. Cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, showed higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in comparison to the immortalized cell counterpart, HaCaT. Specific inhibitors of SIRT1 (Ex527) and SIRT2 (AGK2) impaired the growth of the cervical cancer cells, SiHa, but not of the HaCaT cells. SIRT1 inhibition caused cell death, while SIRT2 inhibition resulted in cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, we report the overexpression of SIRT2 and SIRT7 proteins in cervical cancer and suggest probable application of sirtuin inhibitors as therapeutic targets. Further, a specific increase in the levels of SIRT1 in intraepithelial lesion makes it a promising candidate for identification of preneoplastic changes."

OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles.

The first evidence for long-term transmission of CT's toxic effect via extracellular vesicles was obtained in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To follow the CT intracellular route towards exosome secretion, we used a novel strategy for generating metabolically-labeled fluorescent exosomes that can be counted by flow cytometry assay (FACS) and characterized. Our results clearly show the association of CT with exosomes, together with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) molecules, proteins required for translocation of CTA across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy showed direct internalization of CT containing fluorescent exo into CHO cells coupled with morphological changes in the recipient cells that are characteristic of CT action. Moreover, Me665 cells treated with CT-containing exosomes showed an increase in Adenosine 3',5'-Cyclic Monophosphate (cAMP) level, reaching levels comparable to those seen in cells exposed directly to CT. Our results prompt the idea that CT can exploit an exosome-mediated cell communication pathway to extend its pathophysiological action beyond an initial host cell, into a multitude of cells. This finding could have implications for cholera disease pathogenesis and epidemiology."

In this study, we determined that the mean movement velocity of mitochondria in MNTs between CMs and MFs was approximately 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009nm/s. Meanwhile, treatment with microtubule polymerisation inhibitors nocodazole or colcemid in cell culture decreased mitochondrial velocity, and knockdown of the microtubule motor protein kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) led to a similar effect, indicating that mitochondrial movement was dependent on microtubules and the motor protein KIF5B. Furthermore, we showed that hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced CM apoptosis was attenuated by coculture with intact or hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated MFs, which transferred mitochondria to CMs. This rescue was prevented either by separating the cells using Transwell culture or by impairing mitochondrial transfer with nocodazole or colcemid treatment. In conclusion, as a novel means of intercellular communication, MNTs rescue distressed CMs from apoptosis by transporting mitochondria along microtubules via KIF5B."

While the proportion of the two protamines is highly variable between different species, abnormal ratios within a species are known to be associated with male subfertility. Therefore, it is more than likely that correct protamine expression represents a kind of chromatin checkpoint during sperm development rendering protamines as suitable biomarkers for the estimation of sperm quality. This review presents an overview of our current knowledge on protamines comparing gene and protein structures between different mammalian species with particular consideration given to man, mouse and stallion.

Areas covered: A massive scrutiny of AD-related PubMed publications (ps)(2013-2017) identified 42,053ps of which 8,380 (19.60%) were associated with AD treatments.

Randomized clinical trials have assessed effects of several classes of drugs on plasma cholesterol levels in CAD patients. Agents including cholestyramine, fibrates, niacin, and statins significantly lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and induce modest increases in HDL-C, but tolerance issues and undesirable side effects are common. Additionally, residual risk may be present in patients with persistently low HDL-C and other complications despite a reduction in LDL-C.

Moreover, little is known about how cell-fate determinants are regulated in functionally important subnetworks in large gene-regulatory networks (i.e., GRN motifs). Here we propose a model of stem cell differentiation in which cell-fate determinants work synergistically to determine different cellular identities, and reside in a class of GRN motifs known as feedback loops. Based on this model, we develop a computational method that can systematically predict cell-fate determinants and their GRN motifs. The method was able to recapitulate experimentally validated cell-fate determinants, and validation of two predicted cell-fate determinants confirmed that overexpression of ESR1 and RUNX2 in mouse neural stem cells induces neuronal and astrocyte differentiation, respectively. Thus, the presented GRN-based model of stem cell differentiation and computational method can guide differentiation experiments in stem cell research and regenerative medicine."

The (14)C levels observed in cartilage collagen showed that, virtually, no replacement of the collagen matrix happened after skeletal maturity and that neither OA nor tissue damage, per se, influenced collagen turnover. Regional differences in (14)C content across the joint surface showed that cartilage collagen located centrally on the joint surface is formed several years earlier than collagen located peripherally.

PIM-1 expression levels in 4 pairs of ACC tissues and corresponding normal salivary gland tissues were determined by western blot analysis. PIM-1, FOXO3a, BAD and BCL-2 expression levels in 60 ACC tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay was performed to detect the apoptosis status of ACC tissues. PIM-1 was revealed to be highly expressed in ACC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. IHC staining results demonstrated high expression ratios of PIM-1, FOXO3a, BCL-2 and BAD [33.33% (20/60), 51.67% (31/60), 51.67% (31/60) and 55% (33/60)], respectively, and significant correlations between the expression of PIM-1 and FOXO3a and BCL-2 (P<0.05). Apoptotic rates were significantly associated with PIM-1, FOXO3a, BCL-2 and BAD expression levels (P<0.05). PIM-1 expression levels were significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node involvement, nerve invasion, distant metastasis and weakly associated with tumor node metastasis stage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that PIM-1 expression level was significantly associated with disease-free survival of patients with ACC (P=0.009). Cox regression multivariate analysis results revealed that histotype, distant metastasis and apoptotic rate were independent prognosis factors for ACC. Assessment of PIM-1 may be useful in investigating the malignant behaviors of ACC and predicting the outcome of patients with ACC."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of ZO-1 expression by GM-CSF is unclear. Herein, we found that the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG cooperated with the proto-oncogene protein c-MYC in regulation of ZO-1 transcription in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). The ERG expression was suppressed by miR-96 which was increased by GM-CSF through the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of miR-96 prevented ZO-1 down-regulation induced by GM-CSF both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Our results revealed the mechanism of ZO-1 expression reduced by GM-CSF, and provided a potential target, miR-96, which could block ZO-1 down-regulation caused by GM-CSF in BMECs."

While pim1 has been shown to be involved in several hematopoietic cancers, it was also recently identified as a target of aberrant somatic hypermutation in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The crystal structures of Pim1 in apo form and bound with AMPPNP have been solved and several unique features of Pim1 were identified, including the presence of an extra beta-hairpin in the N-terminal lobe and an unusual conformation of the hinge connecting the two lobes of the enzyme. While the apo Pim1 structure is nearly identical with that reported recently, the structure of AMPPNP bound to Pim1 is significantly different. Pim1 is unique among protein kinases due to the presence of a proline residue at position 123 that precludes the formation of the canonical second hydrogen bond between the hinge backbone and the adenine moiety of ATP. One crystal structure reported here shows that changing P123 to methionine, a common residue that offers the backbone hydrogen bond to ATP, does not restore the ATP binding pocket of Pim1 to that of a typical kinase. These unique structural features in Pim1 result in novel binding modes of AMP and a known kinase inhibitor scaffold, as shown by co-crystallography. In addition, the kinase activities of five Pim1 mutants identified in DLCL patients have been determined. In each case, the observed effects on kinase activity are consistent with the predicted consequences of the mutation on the Pim1 structure. Finally, 70 co-crystal structures of low molecular mass, low-affinity compounds with Pim1 have been solved in order to identify novel chemical classes as potential Pim1 inhibitors. Based on the structural information, opportunities for optimization of one specific example are discussed."

They were added individually to cells growing in serum-free medium next to controls in medium supplemented with serum, thus containing a mixture of them all, or in serum-free medium alone. Variations were detected by means of a microarray of 810 antibodies targeting relevant proteins. All tested factors triggered increased proliferation and migration. Further analysis showed that TNF-\u03b1 is the prime factor responsible for the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. CCL4 is associated with cellular neovascularization, whereas FGF2 and IL6 induction led to better cellular survival and decreased apoptotic activity of the stellate cells. The identified direct effects of individual cytokines on human pancreatic stellate cells provide new insights about their contribution to pancreatic cancer promotion. "

Genetic approaches that use mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms have also been used in some in vitro studies and in tumor models and are particularly useful where mtDNA is damaged or deleted. These approaches can also be used to study the long-term consequences of mitochondrial transfer such as in bone marrow and organ transplantation and in tumour biology where inherent mitochondrial damage is often a key feature. As research on intercellular mitochondrial transfer moves from cell culture into animal models and human diseases it will be important to understand the limitations of the various techniques in order to apply appropriate methodologies to address physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
