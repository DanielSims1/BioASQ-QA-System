Extensive examinations failed to reveal any associated malignancy up to 5 months after the onset of the skin eruption. While the skin was improving, and although the patient was still asymptomatic except for a weight loss of 5 kg, evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical region was obtained. Only palliative treatment could be undertaken. The bizarre clinical aspects of the syndrome are reviewed."

Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes shrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early reports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to reduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor burden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional androgen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with single-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a combination study of orteronel with docetaxel. Recently, the ELM-PC5 Phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer who had received prior docetaxel was unblinded as the overall survival primary end point was not achieved. However, additional Phase III orteronel trials are ongoing in men with earlier stages of prostate cancer."

Recent studies demonstrated that ATP can be released from cells in a controlled manner through pannexin (Panx) channels. Panx1-mediated ATP release is involved in inflammasome activation and neutrophil/macrophage chemotaxis, activation of T cells, and a role for Panx1 in inducing and propagating inflammation has been demonstrated in various organs, including lung and the central and peripheral nervous system. The recognition and clearance of dying cells and debris from focal points of inflammation is critical in the resolution of inflammation, and Panx1-mediated ATP release from dying cells has been shown to recruit phagocytes. Moreover, extracellular ATP can be broken down by ectonucleotidases into ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which is critical in the resolution of inflammation. Together, Panx1, ATP, purinergic receptors, and ectonucleotidases contribute to important feedback loops during the inflammatory response, and thus represent promising candidates for new therapies. "

In this study, we determined fragment sizes separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in a patient with an apparently sporadic case of FSHD and in his healthy family members. A 38-kb fragment was detected in the proband, in his older brother, and in their father. This finding prompted a clinical reevaluation of the father and brother. A subclinical phenotype restricted to abdominal muscle weakness was detected, and serum creatine kinase values were found to be elevated in both. The proband's brother also showed evidence of an independently occurring subtelomeric rearrangement of 4q35, which normally occurs in about 20% of the population. The identification of a \"borderline\" 38-kb EcoRI/BlnI fragment in an affected subject and his very mildly affected relatives extends the size range of disease alleles and expands existing data on the variable intrafamilial expressivity of FSHD. This study highlights the importance of a careful molecular and clinical analysis extended to family members of apparently sporadic cases with larger EcoRI/BlnI fragments for accurate diagnosis and appropriate genetic counseling in FSHD."

This includes all of the major choline-containing compounds found in foods. The method offers advantages over other LC methods since HILIC chromatography is readily compatible with electrospray ionization and results in higher sensitivity and improved peak shapes. The LC-MS/MS method allows quantification of all choline-containing compounds in a single run. Tests of method suitability indicated linear ranges of approximately 0.25-25 \u03bcg/ml for PI and PE, 0.5-50 \u03bcg/ml for PC, 0.05-5 \u03bcg/ml for SM and LPC, 0.5-25 \u03bcg/ml for LPE, 0.02-5 \u03bcg/ml for Cho, and 0.08-8 \u03bcg/ml for Bet, respectively. Accuracies of 83-105% with precisions of 1.6-13.2% RSD were achieved for standards over a wide range of concentrations, demonstrating that this method will be suitable for food analysis. 8 polar lipid classes were found in a lipid extract of egg yolk and different species of the same class were differentiated based on their molecular weights and fragment ion information.

In this model, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induces pro-apoptotic genes through the c-Jun/activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor. On the other side, a survival pathway initiated by lithium leads to repression of pro-apoptotic c-Jun/AP-1 target genes without interfering with JNK activity. Yet, the mechanism by which lithium inhibits c-Jun activity remains to be elucidated. Here, we used this model system to study the regulation and function of site-specific c-Jun phosphorylation at the S63 and T91/T93 JNK sites in neuronal cell death. We found that TK-deprivation led to c-Jun multiphosphorylation at all three JNK sites. However, immunofluorescence analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation at single cell level revealed that the S63 site was phosphorylated in all c-Jun-expressing cells, whereas the response of T91/T93 phosphorylation was more sensitive, mirroring the switch-like apoptotic response of CGCs. Conversely, lithium prevented T91T93 phosphorylation and cell death without affecting the S63 site, suggesting that T91T93 phosphorylation triggers c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity. Accordingly, a c-Jun mutant lacking the T95 priming site for T91/93 phosphorylation protected CGCs from apoptosis, whereas it was able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Vice versa, a c-Jun mutant bearing aspartate substitution of T95 overwhelmed lithium-mediate protection of CGCs from TK-deprivation, validating that inhibition of T91/T93/T95 phosphorylation underlies the effect of lithium on cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed multiphosphorylation of c-Jun at T91/T93/T95 in cells. Moreover, JNK phosphorylated recombinant c-Jun at T91/T93 in a T95-dependent manner. On the basis of our results, we propose that T91/T93/T95 multiphosphorylation of c-Jun functions as a sensitivity amplifier of the JNK cascade, setting the threshold for c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity in neuronal cells.

The reaction is fairly insensitive to the methyl donor in the reaction, S-adenosylmethionine. In many cancers, the most frequent class of mutations is C to T changes within CG dinucleotides of the tumor suppressor gene p53.

Identification of a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene (JAK2 V617F) in more than half of all patients with MF has prompted the discovery and clinical development of inhibitors that target JAK2. Although treatment with JAK2 inhibitors has been shown to improve symptom response and quality of life in patients with MF, these drugs do not alter the underlying disease; therefore, novel therapies are needed. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been shown to play a role in normal hematopoiesis and in the tumorigenesis of hematologic malignancies. Moreover, inhibitors of the Hh pathway have been shown to inhibit growth and self-renewal capacity in preclinical models of MF. In a mouse model of MF, combined inhibition of the Hh and JAK pathways reduced JAK2 mutant allele burden, reduced bone marrow fibrosis, and reduced white blood cell and platelet counts. Preliminary clinical data also suggest that inhibition of the Hh pathway, alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibition, may enable disease modification in patients with MF. Future studies, including one combining the Hh pathway inhibitor sonidegib and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, are underway in patients with MF and will inform whether this combination approach can lead to true disease modification.

Using bivariate DNA distribution methodology, we determined the proportion of replicating and arresting S-phase cells and observed that, whereas normal cells arrested DNA replication in the presence of Me(3)Pso cross-links and monoadducts, FA lymphoblasts failed to arrest DNA synthesis. Taken together, the above data suggest that, in response to damage induced by DNA cross-linking agents, the S-phase checkpoint is inefficient in FA cells.

The end point of this pathway is to induce transcription, and to this end, there is a need to overcome a major obstacle, a set of inhibitors (I\u03baBs) that bind NF-\u03baB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for the elimination of the inhibitors: activation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and I\u03baB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, \u03b2-TrCP, recognizes the I\u03baB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples I\u03baB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) -mediated I\u03baB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of \u03b2-TrCP results in accumulation of all the I\u03baBs and complete NF-\u03baB inhibition. As many details of I\u03baB-\u03b2-TrCP interaction have been worked out, the development of \u03b2-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible therapeutic approach for NF-\u03baB-associated human disease. However, we may still need to advance our understanding of the mechanism of I\u03baB degradation as well as of the diverse functions of \u03b2-TrCP in vivo."

They have also had choreoathetosis since early infancy. Genetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in two patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb deletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient. Congenital hypothyroidism was not detected on neonatal screening in the patient with the missense mutation, and frequent respiratory infections were observed in the patient with the deletion in NKX2-1. Oral levodopa did not improve the gait disturbance or involuntary movement. The results of (99m)Tc-ECD single-photon emission computed tomography (ECD-SPECT) analyzed using the easy Z-score imaging system showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the bilateral basal ganglia, especially in the caudate nuclei, in all three patients, but no brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.

The quantitative label-free data from plasma showed a significant increase over time with the spontaneous onset and progression of ovarian cancer making it a potential protein biomarker for further study. Two other proteins of interest identified from this initial study included vitellogenin-1 (Vit-1), a lipid-transport protein tied to egg production, and transthyretin (TTR), a retinol binding transport protein currently used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. A multiplexed protein cleavage isotope dilution mass spectrometry (PC-IDMS) assay was developed to quantify OVOS2, Vit-1, and TTR by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). A total of 6 stable isotope labeled (SIL) peptide standards were used in the assay with three tryptic peptides from OVOS2, one for Vit-1, and two for TTR. The assay was developed for use with un-depleted raw plasma combined with the filter assisted sample preparation (FASP) method and its use was also demonstrated for matched ovary tissue samples. The PC-IDMS data for the two TTR peptides did not correlate with each other with more than a 10-fold difference in concentration for all 5 time points measured. The PC-IDMS data from the longitudinal plasma samples correlated well for OVOS2 and Vit-1 whereas TTR was inconclusive. Interestingly, the absolute amount for one of the OVOS2 SIL peptides was 2-fold less compared with the other two SIL peptides. These data illustrate the successes and challenges of qualifying quantitative levels of proteins from an in-gel digestion sample preparation followed by LC-MS/MS (GeLC) label-free discovery-based approach to a targeted SRM-based quantitative assay in plasma and tissues.

Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, as well as starvation and lysosomal disruption, activates TFEB by promoting its nuclear translocation. In addition, the transcriptional response of lysosomal and autophagic genes to either lysosomal dysfunction or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 is suppressed in TFEB-/- cells. Interestingly, the Rag GTPase complex, which senses lysosomal amino acids and activates mTORC1, is both necessary and sufficient to regulate starvation- and stress-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB. These data indicate that the lysosome senses its content and regulates its own biogenesis by a lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism that involves TFEB and mTOR."

Computed tomographic examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax revealed an intramuscular tumour measuring 40 mm in size in the left scapular region. Histopathological examination of an open biopsy specimen revealed a small round cell tumour that showed positive staining for CD99. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a split signal by a break-apart probe for the EWS gene in chromosome 22q12. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having secondary Ewing sarcoma. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, however, she died of pulmonary metastases 2 years after the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma.

In the present study, we have used a combination of techniques (heteroduplex analysis, sequencing, loss of heterozygosity and quantification of gene dosage) to define the genetic defect in 68 individuals from a cohort of 107 NF1 Taiwanese patients of Chinese origin. Fifty-eight were initially identified using heteroduplex analytical techniques and confirmed by sequence analysis. A further five were identified by direct sequence analysis alone. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Mis-sense, non-sense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations were identified across the entire gene of which the majority (45/68) were novel in nature.

Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions."

Natural proMMP-9 occurs as monomers, homomultimers and heterocomplexes, but our knowledge about the overall structure of proMMP-9 monomers and multimers is limited. We investigated biochemical, biophysical and functional characteristics of zymogen and activated forms of MMP-9 monomers and multimers. In contrast with a conventional notion of a dimeric nature of MMP-9 homomultimers, we demonstrate that these are reduction-sensitive trimers. Based on the information from electrophoresis, AFM and TEM, we generated a 3D structure model of the proMMP-9 trimer. Remarkably, the proMMP-9 trimers possessed a 50-fold higher affinity for TIMP-1 than the monomers. In\u00a0vivo, this finding was reflected in a higher extent of TIMP-1 inhibition of angiogenesis induced by trimers compared with monomers. Our results show that proMMP-9 trimers constitute a novel structural and functional entity that is differentially regulated by TIMP-1. "

The recent ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) study reported 9,640 lncRNA loci in the human genome, which corresponds to around half the number of protein-coding genes. Because of this sheer number and their functional diversity, it is crucial to identify a pool of potentially relevant lncRNAs early on in a given study. In this review, we evaluate the methods for isolating lncRNAs by immunoprecipitation and review the advantages, disadvantages, and applications of three widely used approaches - microarray, tiling array, and RNA-seq - for identifying lncRNAs involved in gene regulation. We also look at ways in which data from publicly available databases such as ENCODE can support the study of lncRNAs."

In embryonic stem cells, pluripotency and self renewal capacities are provided by a network of OCT3/4, NANOG and SOX2. In testicular germ cell tumors, pluripotency genes OCT3/4 und NANOG are upregulated both, in seminomas and non-seminomas, while SOX2 is differentially upregulated in embryonal carcinomas only.

Furthermore, all invasive TGCTs show a consistent gain of the short arm of chromosome 12, as found in ES cells upon extensive in vitro culturing. Moreover, the genetic constitution of testicular germ cell tumors can also be linked to characteristics of embryonic stem cells, likely related to their specific inability to repair DNA damage and their high sensitivity to apoptotic cell death.

GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.

The BRCA1 protein is an important regulator of DNA double-strand break repair, and BRCA1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, BRCA1 function may contribute to enforcement of the G(2) cell cycle checkpoint. E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known enzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger domain. The C-terminal BRCT repeat domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions, is the only other identified structural domain. By investigating cancer-linked mutations within each domain, we demonstrate that truncation of the BRCT domain greatly impairs the stability and nuclear localization of BRCA1 protein. A missense mutation within the RING domain does not affect these biochemical properties. However, both mutant forms of BRCA1 fail to colocalize in nuclear foci with the known BRCA1-interacting proteins BARD1 and BACH1, which are important for DNA repair. This failure occurs despite the continued ability of the RING mutant protein to interact with BACH1 and the ability of the BRCT mutant to interact with BARD1. Furthermore, neither mutant form of BRCA1 is recruited into DNA damage-associated foci marked by gamma-H2AX. Therefore, our data suggest that both the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1 are required for an early step in the function of BRCA1 during DNA repair: recruitment to the sites of DNA damage."

Here we show that transcription of atxA does not appear to differ in cells grown in 5% CO2 compared with cells grown in air. Using a new efficient method for gene replacement in B. anthracis, we constructed an atxA-null mutant in which the atxA-coding sequence on pXO1 is replaced with an omega km-2 cassette. Transcription of all three toxin genes is decreased in the absence of atxA. The pag gene possesses two apparent transcription start sites, P1 and P2; only transcripts with 5' ends mapping to P1 are decreased in the atxA-null mutant. Deletion analysis of the pag promoter region indicates that the 111 bp region upstream of the P1 site is sufficient for atxA-mediated activation of this transcript. The cya and lef genes each have one apparent start site for transcription. Transcripts with 5' ends mapping to these sites are not detected in the atxA-null mutant. The atxA-null mutant is avirulent in mice. Moreover, the antibody response to all three toxin proteins is decreased significantly in atxA-null mutant-infected mice.

Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable structural analog oprozomib are second-generation, highly-selective, proteasome inhibitors. However, the mechanisms of acquired resistance to carfilzomib and oprozomib are incompletely understood, and effective strategies for overcoming this resistance are needed. Here, we developed models of acquired resistance to carfilzomib in two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UMSCC-1 and Cal33, through gradual exposure to increasing drug concentrations. The resistant lines R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 demonstrated 205- and 64-fold resistance, respectively, relative to the parental lines. Similarly, a high level of cross-resistance to oprozomib, as well as paclitaxel, was observed, whereas only moderate resistance to bortezomib (8- to 29-fold), and low level resistance to cisplatin (1.5- to 5-fold) was seen. Synergistic induction of apoptosis signaling and cell death, and inhibition of colony formation followed co-treatment of acquired resistance models with carfilzomib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat. Synergism was also seen with other combinations, including oprozomib plus vorinostat, or carfilzomib plus the HDACi entinostat. Synergism was accompanied by upregulation of proapoptotic Bik, and suppression of Bik attenuated the synergy. The acquired resistance models also exhibited elevated levels of MDR-1/P-gp. Inhibition of MDR-1/P-gp with reversin 121 partially overcame carfilzomib resistance in R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 cells. Collectively, these studies indicate that combining carfilzomib or oprozomib with HDAC or MDR-1/P-gp inhibitors may be a useful strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to these proteasome inhibitors.

In contrast, germline mutations that act to increase canonical Wnt signaling lead to distinctive osteosclerotic phenotypes. Here, we identified de novo frameshift mutations in DVL1, a mediator of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as the cause of RS-OS, an RS subtype involving osteosclerosis, in three unrelated individuals. The mutations all delete the DVL1 C terminus and replace it, in each instance, with a novel, highly basic sequence. We showed the presence of mutant transcript in fibroblasts from one individual with RS-OS and demonstrated unimpaired protein stability with transfected GFP-tagged constructs bearing a frameshift mutation. In\u00a0vitro TOPFlash assays, in apparent contradiction to the osteosclerotic phenotype, revealed that the mutant allele was less active than the wild-type allele in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. However, when the mutant and wild-type alleles were co-expressed, canonical Wnt activity was 2-fold higher than that in the wild-type construct alone. This work establishes that DVL1 mutations cause a specific RS subtype, RS-OS, and that the osteosclerosis associated with this subtype might be the result of an interaction between the wild-type and mutant alleles and thus lead to elevated canonical Wnt signaling.

Recent studies demonstrate that piperlongumine selectively kills various types of transformed cells with minimal toxicity to non-transformed cells by inducing a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS generates various types of DNA lesions, including base modifications and single strand breaks. In order to examine the contribution of ROS-induced DNA damage to the cytotoxicity by piperlongumine, various DNA repair-deficient chicken DT40 cell-lines with a single DNA repair gene deletion were tested for cellular sensitivity to piperlongumine. The results showed that cell lines defective in homologous recombination (HR) display hyper-sensitivity to piperlongumine, while other cell lines with a deficiency in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, or translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases, show no sensitivity to piperlongumine. The results strongly implicate that double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by piperlongumine are major cytotoxic DNA lesions. Furthermore, a deletion of 53BP1 or Ku70 in the BRCA1-deficient cell line restored cellular resistance to piperlongumine. This strongly supports the idea that piperlongumine induces DSB- mediated cell death. Interestingly, piperlongumine makes the wild type DT40 cell line hypersensitive to a PARP-inhibitor, Olaparib. The results implicate that piperlongumine inhibits HR. Further analysis with cell-based HR assay and the kinetic study of Rad51 foci formation confirmed that piperlongumine suppresses HR activity. Altogether, we revealed novel mechanisms of piperlongumine-induced cytotoxicity. "

All these hypotheses are currently tested in many clinical trials.

The evidence so far shows that SGLT2 inhibitors are equally effective to established antidiabetic agents such as metformin or sulfonylureas in their ability to lower HbA1c. On the other hand, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the possibility of genitourinary infections in type 2 diabetic individuals.

Elc1 has also been suggested to be present in another ubiquitin ligase complex that lacks Rad7 and Rad16 and is involved in UV-induced ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RNA polymerase II. Here we show that elc1 deletion increases UV sensitivity of TCR-deficient cells but does not affect the UV sensitivity of otherwise wild type and GGR-deficient cells. Cells deleted for elc1 show normal NER in the transcribed strand of an active gene but have no detectable NER in the non-transcribed strand. Elc1 does not affect UV-induced mutagenesis when TCR is operative, but plays an important role in preventing the mutagenesis if TCR is defective. Furthermore, the levels of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are not significantly decreased in elc1 cells, and overexpression of Rad7 and Rad16 individually or simultaneously in elc1 cells does not restore repair in the non-transcribed strand of an active gene. Our results suggest that Elc1 has no function in TCR but plays an important role in GGR. Furthermore, the role of Elc1 in GGR may not be subsidiary to that of Rad7 and Rad16."

Intron F contains a fully consensus branch site sequence (UUCCUUAAC). Mutations at each position were analyzed for their effects on U12-dependent splicing in vivo. Mutations at most positions resulted in a significant reduction of correct U12-dependent splicing. Defects observed included increased unspliced RNA levels, the activation of cryptic U2-dependent 5' and 3' splice sites, and the activation of cryptic U12-dependent branch/3' splice sites. A strong correlation was observed between the predicted thermodynamic stability of the branch site: U12 snRNA interaction and correct U12-dependent splicing. The lack of a polypyrimidine tract between the branch site and 3' splice site of U12-dependent introns and the observed reliance on base-pairing interactions for correct U12-dependent splicing emphasize the importance of RNA/RNA interactions during U12-dependent intron recognition and proper splice site selection."

Post-translational neddylation of CUL, a process triggered by the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 subunit 1 (NAE1), is required for CRL activation. Recently, MLN4924 was discovered via a high-throughput screen as a specific NAE1 inhibitor and first-in-class anticancer drug. By blocking CUL neddylation, MLN4924 inactivates CRL and causes the accumulation of CRL substrates that trigger cell cycle arrest, senescence and/or apoptosis to suppress the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we found that MLN4924 also triggers protective autophagy in response to CRL inactivation. MLN4924-induced autophagy is attributed partially to the inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (also known as mammalian target of rapamycin, MTOR) activity by the accumulation of the MTOR inhibitory protein DEPTOR, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Moreover, the blockage of autophagy response enhances apoptosis in MLN4924-treated cells. Together, our findings not only reveal autophagy as a novel cellular response to CRL inactivation by MLN4924, but also provide a piece of proof-of-concept evidence for the combination of MLN4924 with autophagy inhibitors to enhance therapeutic efficacy."

The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade. Mechanistically, HAX-1 promoted formation of phospholamban monomers, the active/inhibitory units of the calcium pump. Indeed, ablation of PLN rescued HAX-1 inhibition of contractility in vivo.

It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs-specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to approximately 20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes."

Treatment with antibiotics is usually recommended for patients who have an increase in sputum volume, sputum purulence and breathlessness, but the most important determinant of bacterial infection appears to be purulence. There is some evidence to suggest that the decision to use antibiotics can be guided by the use of procalcitonin, although this needs to be confirmed in further studies. Newer broad-spectrum antibiotics may be more effective than older antibiotics but, because of concerns regarding antibiotic resistance, it may be appropriate to reserve them for patients at highest risk of treatment failure. A number of studies suggest that antibiotic courses of 5 days in duration may be as effective as those for 7 days or more in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations of COPD. Guidelines do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that they may reduce the number of exacerbations.

We have investigated two unrelated children with a previously unreported pattern of severe developmental defects on the anterior-posterior (a-p) limb axis and in the genitalia, consisting of a single bone in the zeugopod, either monodactyly or oligodactyly in the autopod of all four limbs, and penoscrotal hypoplasia. Both children are heterozygous for a deletion that eliminates at least eight (HOXD3-HOXD13) of the nine genes in the HOXD cluster. We propose that the patients' phenotypes are due in part to haploinsufficiency for HOXD-cluster genes. This hypothesis is supported by the expression patterns of these genes in early vertebrate embryos. However, the involvement of additional genes in the region could explain the discordance, in severity, between these human phenotypes and the milder, non-polarized phenotypes present in mice hemizygous for HoxD cluster genes. These cases represent the first reported examples of deficiencies for an entire Hox cluster in vertebrates and suggest that the diploid dose of human HOXD genes is crucial for normal growth and patterning of the limbs along the anterior-posterior axis."

The enhanced p53 activity further slows down cell cycle progression and leads to cell growth inhibition. Conversely, the level of p53 is dramatically decreased upon the depletion of RPL6, indicating that RPL6 is essential for p53 stabilization. We also found that RPL6 translocalizes from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm under ribosomal stress, which facilitates its binding with HDM2. The interaction of RPL6 and HDM2 drives HDM2-mediated RPL6 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Longer treatment of actinomycin D increases RPL6 ubiquitination and destabilizes RPL6, and thereby putatively attenuates p53 response until the level of L6 subsides. Therefore, RPL6 and HDM2 form an autoregulatory feedback loop to monitor the level of p53 in response to ribosomal stress. Together, our study identifies the crucial function of RPL6 in regulating HDM2-p53 pathway, which highlights the importance of RPL6 in human genetic diseases and cancers. "

Histologically, cutaneous B-LBLs may be confused with other small round-cell neoplasms. Moreover, half of B-LBL patients are negative for CD45 (leucocyte common antigen, LCA), a widely used marker for the diagnosis of lymphoma, and a significant portion express CD99, a marker for Ewing's sarcoma (ES) or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Therefore, an extranodal B-LBL may be misinterpreted as PNET or ES. Here, we report on 2 boys, aged 10 and 5 years, with primary cutaneous B-LBL of the scalp. PNET was initially misdiagnosed because the tumor cells were negative for CD45 but strongly positive for CD99. Advanced stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed later and both patients died during the course of treatment for ALL. In retrospective analyses, tumor cells in the initial biopsy specimens of both patients were found to be reactive to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD43 and CD10. Thus, the diagnosis of B-LBL was confirmed. These cases illustrate the possibility that primary cutaneous B-LBL may mimic ES or PNET immunophenotypically, and that correct diagnosis in doubtful cases may be facilitated by analysis using a complete panel of antibodies, particularly including TdT and CD43."

During exercise preceded by warming-up, the mean skin temperature (T sk) and external auditory canal temperature (Tac) did not change significantly in contrast to exercise without warming-up, producing a rise in both T sk and Tac (by approx. 1.2 degrees C and 1.1 degrees C, respectively). Warming-up did not alter the course of the rectal temperature changes during exercise. With warming-up skin humidity rose immediately after the beginning of exercise, whereas the onset of sweating without warming-up appeared much later at higher work intensities. Warming-up did not change the circulatory and ventilatory responses to incremental exercise and the oxygen uptake (VO2) either at submaximal or maximal work loads. With warming-up a significant increase was found in the threshold work load both at the AT and the IAT. The data demonstrated that warming-up has an advantageous effect on the efficiency of thermoregulation in endurance-trained athletes producing an early sweating response to the incremental exercise that results in attenuation of hyperthermia. An increase in the anaerobic threshold during incremental exercise preceded by warming-up may indicate an enhancement of the endurance capacity subsequent to warming-up."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 female patients were included in this prospective study. Eligibility criteria included: pT1c-3, pN0-1a, grade 2/3, hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative tumor. The clinical risk was determined by Adjuvant! Online (AOL).  RESULTS: 38 patients (63%) where considered to be low-risk patients by the 70-gene signature, while 22 (37%) were considered to be high-risk patients. No statistically significant differences between low- and high-risk groups could be detected for conventional prognostic parameters, particularly not for Ki-67. By AOL, 33 patients (55%) were considered to be at high risk, of which 20 had a discordant MammaPrint(TM) result. The discordance rate between the profile and AOL was 48%, which is higher than in previous publications. When the 70-gene signature was used in combination with the clinical risk assessment, the recommendation for adjuvant systemic treatment differed in 11 patients (18%).  CONCLUSIONS: In the intermediate-risk subgroup, the 70-gene signature could be useful to decide in elderly patients whether they may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Conventional clinicopathological factors were not suitable for a prediction of the 70-gene signature results in these patients."

                    "context": "Viruses in the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family are arthropod-transmitted and contribute to staggering numbers of human infections and significant deaths annually across the globe. To identify cellular factors with antiviral activity against flaviviruses, we screened a cDNA library using an iterative approach. We identified a mammalian Hsp40 chaperone protein (DNAJC14) that when overexpressed was able to mediate protection from yellow fever virus (YFV)-induced cell death. Further studies revealed that DNAJC14 inhibits YFV at the step of viral RNA replication. Since replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a member of the related Pestivirus genus, is also known to be modulated by DNAJC14, we tested the effect of this host factor on diverse Flaviviridae family members. Flaviviruses, including the pathogenic Asibi strain of YFV, Kunjin, and tick-borne Langat virus, as well as a Hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), all were inhibited by overexpression of DNAJC14. Mutagenesis showed that both the J-domain and the C-terminal domain, which mediates self-interaction, are required for anti-YFV activity. We found that DNAJC14 does not block YFV nor HCV NS2-3 cleavage, and using non-inhibitory mutants demonstrate that DNAJC14 is recruited to YFV replication complexes. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that endogenous DNAJC14 rearranges during infection and is found in replication complexes identified by dsRNA staining. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous DNAJC14 results in impaired YFV replication suggesting a requirement for DNAJC14 in YFV replication complex assembly. Finally, the antiviral activity of overexpressed DNAJC14 occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. DNAJC14 overexpression may disrupt the proper stoichiometry resulting in inhibition, which can be overcome upon restoration of the optimal ratios due to the accumulation of viral nonstructural proteins. Our findings, together with previously published work, suggest that the members of the Flaviviridae family have evolved in unique and important ways to interact with this host Hsp40 chaperone molecule."

Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to study the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels expressed by H146 SCLC cells and the effects of LES antibodies on these channels. The types of Ca2+ channels were determined using biophysical properties and pharmacological sensitivity to several antagonists. 2. Whole-cell Ca2+ currents (ICa) in SCLC cells are sensitive to the dihydropyridine (DHP) nicardipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA) and omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-AgTX IVA). Nicardipine at 100 nM and 10 microM reduced ICa by 35 and 45% (n = 38 cells), respectively, while omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) inhibited ICa by 32% (n = 31). Application of omega-AgTX IVA at 50 and 100 nM to the cancer cells decreased ICa by 41 and 42%, respectively (n = 22). 3. Measurement of cell membrane capacitance (Cm) revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis underlies the secretory activity of SCLC cells. Exocytosis, when induced by step depolarizing pulses and measured by increases in Cm, was markedly inhibited by nicardipine (10 microM) and omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM). In contrast, omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) was not as effective in altering increases in Cm. 4. From negative (-80 mV) and depolarized (-40 mV) holding potentials, both peak and plateau ICa were inhibited by the presence of LES antibodies (1 mg ml-1 IgG). LES serum also reduced depolarization-induced increases in Cm by 48% (n = 15). 5. To determine whether the LES antibodies are downregulating a specific type(s) of Ca2+ channel, nicardipine (10 microM), omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) or omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM) was applied to tumour cells that had been previously exposed to LES serum for 24 h. The most pronounced change was that omega-AgTX IVA was 38-84% less effective at reducing ICa after the IgG treatment. The effectiveness of nicardipine was diminished by 18% after incubation with the LES antibodies, whereas the omega-CgTX GVIA was seen to be more effective. These results suggest that LES IgG downregulates P-type Ca2+ channels and, possibly, to a lesser extent L-type channels. 6. In view of recent evidence that P-type Ca2+ channels mediate cholinergic transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the expression of P-type Ca2+ channels in the SCLC cells and the reactivity of LES IgG with these channels support the hypothesis that P-type Ca2+ channels in these cancer cells may trigger the autoantibody production in this disorder. The antibodies so produced are implicated in the functional impairment of the Ca2+ channels characteristic of LES."

In contrast to other groups of antibiotic peptides, the lantibiotics display a substantial degree of specificity for particular components of bacterial membranes. Mersacidin and actagardine were shown to bind with high affinity to the lipid coupled peptidoglycan precursor, the so-called lipid II, which prevents the polymerisation of the cell wall monomers into a functional murein sacculus. The lantibiotics nisin and epidermin also bind tightly to this cell wall precursor; however, for these lantibiotics the binding of lipid II has two consequences. Like with mersacidin blocking of lipid II inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis; in addition, lipid II is used as a specific docking molecule for the formation of pores. This combination of lethal effects explains the potency of these peptides, which are active in nanomolar concentration. Other type-A lantibiotics are believed to also use docking molecules for pore formation, although identification of such membrane components has not yet been achieved."

The recent approval of the CTLA-4-blocking antibody ipilimumab for the treatment of melanoma was a watershed event, opening up a new era in the field of immunotherapy. Ipilimumab was the first treatment to ever show enhanced overall survival (OS) for patients with stage IV melanoma. However, measuring response rates using standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or modified World Health Organization criteria or progression-free survival does not accurately capture the potential for clinical benefit for ipilimumab-treated patients. As immunotherapy approaches are translated into more tumor types, it is important to study biomarkers, which may be more predictive of OS to identify the patients most likely to have clinical benefit. Ipilimumab is the first-in-class of a series of immunomodulating antibodies that are in clinical development. Anti-PD1 (nivolumab and MK-3475), anti-PD-L1 (BMS-936 559, RG7446, and MEDI4736), anti-CD137 (urelumab), anti-OX40, anti-GITR, and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies are just some of the agents that are being actively investigated in clinical trials, each having the potential for combination with the ipilimumab to enhance its effectiveness. Development of rational combinations of immunomodulatory antibodies with small-molecule pathway inhibitor therapies such as vemurafenib makes the discovery of predictive biomarkers even more important.

They also participate, with RhoA, in the regulation of gene transcription by activating serum response factor (SRF)-mediated transcription from the serum response element (SRE). SRF-mediated transcription is also promoted by several proteins that regulate the polymerization or stability of actin. We have previously identified a family of PP2C phosphatases, POPXs, which can dephosphorylate the CDC42/RAC-activated kinase PAK and downregulate its enzymatic and actin cytoskeletal activity. We now report that POPX2 interacts with the formin protein mDia1 (DIAPH1). This interaction is enhanced when mDia1 is activated by RhoA. The binding of POPX2 to mDia1 or to an mDia-containing complex greatly decreases the ability of mDia1 to activate transcription from the SRE. We propose that the interaction between mDia1 and POPX2 (PPM1F) serves to regulate both the actin cytoskeleton and SRF-mediated transcription, and to link the CDC42/RAC1 pathways with those of RhoA."

Arginine methylation has been reported to regulate RNA processing, gene transcription, DNA damage repair, protein translocation, and signal transduction. Lysine methylation is best known to regulate histone function and is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. To better study protein methylation, we have developed highly specific antibodies against monomethyl arginine; asymmetric dimethyl arginine; and monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl lysine motifs. These antibodies were used to perform immunoaffinity purification of methyl peptides followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and quantify arginine and lysine methylation sites in several model studies. Overall, we identified over 1000 arginine methylation sites in human cell line and mouse tissues, and \u223c160 lysine methylation sites in human cell line HCT116. The number of methylation sites identified in this study exceeds those found in the literature to date. Detailed analysis of arginine-methylated proteins observed in mouse brain compared with those found in mouse embryo shows a tissue-specific distribution of arginine methylation, and extends the types of proteins that are known to be arginine methylated to include many new protein types. Many arginine-methylated proteins that we identified from the brain, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, and vesicle proteins, are involved in synaptic transmission, whereas the most abundant methylated proteins identified from mouse embryo are transcriptional regulators and RNA processing proteins.

Because these therapies are inherently nonspecific, there is an increased likelihood of off-target and incomplete effects; therefore, targeted modalities are required for enhanced safety and efficacy. Rindopepimut is emerging as a safe and potentially effective drug for the treatment of GBM. Rindopepimut consists of a 14-mer peptide that spans the length of EGF receptor variant III, a mutant variant of EGF receptor found on approximately 30% of primary GBM, conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Vaccination with rindopepimut has been shown to specifically eliminate cells expressing EGF receptor variant III. Phase II clinical trials have suggested that vaccination of newly diagnosed GBM patients with rindopepimut plus adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor results in prolonged progression-free and overall survival with minimal toxicity. This review will outline the development of rindopepimut, as well as the current status of this vaccine."

However, its therapeutic use in Her2/neu overexpressing NSCLC remains obscure. The present study aimed to determine the role of (64)Cu-labeled trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) for non-invasive imaging of Her2/neu expression in NSCLC. Trastuzumab was conjugated with the bifunctional chelator 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and radiolabeled with (64)Cu. The molecular specificity of DOTA-trastuzumab was determined in NSCLC cell lines with Her2/neu overexpression (NCI-H2170) and negative expression (NCI-H520). Imaging of Her2/neu expression was performed in NCI-H2170 tumor-bearing mice with (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET and (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG. In vitro studies revealed specific binding of DOTA-trastuzumab in the Her2/neu positive NCI-H2170 cells, while no binding was seen in the Her2/neu negative NCI-H520 cell line. Biodistribution and PET studies revealed a significantly high accumulation of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in the Her2/neu overexpressing NCI-H2170 tumor at 24 and 48 h post-injection (21.4 +/- 1.4% and 23.2 +/- 5.1% injection dose/gram (% ID/g), respectively). PET imaging of Her2/neu negative NCI-H520 tumors showed much less uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (4.0% ID/g). The NCI-H2170 tumor uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was significantly higher than that of (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG (P < 0.0001). (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab showed a very clear image of a Her2/neu positive tumor and appeared to be effective as a PET tracer for imaging of Her2/neu gene expression in NSCLC, suggesting its potential clinical use for identifying patients that might benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy."

Because of the excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses, imatinib has moved toward first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. However, the emergence of resistance to imatinib remains a major problem in the treatment of Ph-positive leukemia. Several mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been identified, including BCR-ABL gene amplification that leads to overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein, point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding, and point mutations outside of the kinase domain that allosterically inhibit imatinib binding to BCR-ABL. The need for alternative or additional treatment for imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive leukemia has guided the way to the design of a second generation of targeted therapies, which has resulted mainly in the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors such as AMN107, dasatinib, NS-187, and ON012380. The major goal of these efforts is to create new compounds that are more potent than imatinib and/or more effective against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones. In this review, we discuss the next generation of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors for overcoming imatinib resistance."

We used a high-throughput strategy by diverting the classical use of genotyping microarrays to compare the genotypes of mRNA/cDNA vs. genomic DNA to identify new genes presenting monoallelic expression, starting from human placental material. After filtering of data, we obtained a list of 1,082 putative candidate monoallelic SNPs located in more than one hundred candidate genes. Among these, we found known imprinted genes, such as IPW, GRB10, INPP5F and ZNF597, which contribute to validate the approach. We also explored some likely candidates of our list and identified seven new imprinted genes, including ZFAT, ZFAT-AS1, GLIS3, NTM, MAGI2, ZC3H12Cand LIN28B, four of which encode zinc finger transcription factors. They are, however, not imprinted in the mouse placenta, except for Magi2. We analyzed in more details the ZFAT gene, which is paternally expressed in the placenta (as ZFAT-AS1, a non-coding antisense RNA) but biallelic in other tissues. The ZFAT protein is expressed in endothelial cells, as well as in syncytiotrophoblasts. The expression of this gene is, moreover, downregulated in placentas from complicated pregnancies. With this work we increase by about 10% the number of known imprinted genes in humans."

However, a CASS mediated RNAi-like pathway in enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae O395 or Escherichia coli O157 have not been reported yet. This study specifically was designed to investigate the possibility and evolutionary origin of CASS mediated RNAi-like pathway in the genome of a set of enteric pathogens, especially V. cholerae. The results showed that V. cholerae O395 and also other related enteric pathogens have the essential CASS components (CRISPR and cas genes) to mediate a RNAi-like pathway. The functional domains of a V. cholerae Cas3 protein, which is believed to act as a prokaryotic Dicer, was revealed and compared with the domains of eukaryotic Dicer proteins. Extensive homology in several functional domains provides significant evidence that the Cas3 protein has the essential domains to play a vital role in RNAi like pathway in V. cholerae. The secondary structure of the pre-siRNA for V. cholerae O395 was determined and its thermodynamic stability also reinforced the previous findings and signifies the probability of a RNAi-like pathway in V. cholerae O395."

Here, we evaluated many different protocols from the literature on ostrich cortical bone and moa cortical bone to evaluate their yield and relative purity using the identification of antibody-antigen complexes on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel electrophoresis. Moa bone provided an ancient comparison for the effectiveness of bone extraction protocols tested on ostrich bone. For the immunological part of this study, we focused on collagen I, osteocalcin, and hemoglobin because collagen and osteocalcin are the most abundant proteins in the mineralized extracellular matrix and hemoglobin is common in the vasculature. Most of these procedures demineralize the bone first, and then the remaining organics are chemically extracted. We found that the use of hydrochloric acid, rather than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, for demineralization resulted in the cleanest extractions because the acid was easily removed. In contrast, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resulted in smearing upon electrophoretic separation, possibly indicating these samples were not as pure. The denaturing agents sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, and guanidine HCl have been used extensively for the solubilization of proteins in non-biomineralized tissue, but only the latter has been used on bone. We show that all three denaturing agents are effective for extracting bone proteins. One additional method tested uses ammonium bicarbonate as a solubilizing buffer that is more appropriate for post-extraction analyses (e.g., proteomics) by removing the need for desalting. We found that both guanidine HCl and ammonium bicarbonate were effective for extracting many bone proteins, resulting in similar electrophoretic patterns. With the increasing use of proteomics, a new generation of scientists are now interested in the study of proteins from not only extant bone but also from ancient bone."

This patient had an atypical giant axonal neuropathy phenotype rather similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, without tightly curled hair and mental retardation. The patient had a slowly progressive sensory motor neuropathy since age 3 years, and she also had nystagmus, feet deformities, scoliosis, and cerebellar tonsillar protrusion. Electrophysiological studies indicated a predominantly axonal sensory-motor neuropathy. The diagnosis was confirmed by sural nerve biopsy and direct sequencing of all the 11 gigaxonin exons. The proband's parents are heterozygotes of the disease without symptoms. Our findings extend the number of gigaxonin mutations that cause giant axonal neuropathy. "

In fact, their role in the control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and germ-line genome stability is well known. Female reproductive aging is one of the causes of fertility reduction and it is often associated with egg aneuploidy increase. In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from two groups of women, younger than 35 or older than 38 years, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools of mouse oocytes. TAp73 down regulation in oocytes from women of advanced reproductive age could explain both the reduction of fertility and the increase of newborns with chromosomal abnormalities."

PPIs may decrease the amount of iron absorbed gastrointestinally specifically due to alteration of the pH in the duodenum. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that includes an urge to move legs, accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, the urge to move is partially or totally relieved by movement, and the urge is worse or only occurs at night. In the majority of the restless leg syndrome population, the sensation is deep seated, often described as being in the shin bones, and most commonly felt between the knee and ankle. It may be described as a creepy, shock-like, tense, electric, buzzing, itchy, or even numb sensation. A subpopulation of this restless leg syndrome patient population experiences restless leg syndrome associated pain (RLSAP) that has been described as a deep \"achy pain.\" This pain has not been found to be relieved by many of the typical over the counter analgesics. Often, constant movement of the legs appears to be the only remedy, as these sensations usually appear during periods of rest. Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). The authors theorize that there may be a possible correlation between PPIs and the symptoms (e.g. pain) associated with RLS. The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). While there is no robust direct evidence to support any associations of PPIs and iron deficiency or PPIs associated with RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP), it is hoped that this manuscript may spark research efforts on this issue."

Conditional rsc4 bromodomain mutations were isolated, and were lethal in combination with gcn5Delta, whereas combinations with esa1 grew well. Replacements involving Lys14 of histone H3 (the main target of Gcn5), but not other H3 or H4 lysine residues, also conferred severe growth defects to rsc4 mutant strains. Importantly, wild-type Rsc4 bound an H3 tail peptide acetylated at Lys14, whereas a bromodomain mutant derivative did not. Loss of particular histone deacetylases suppressed rsc4 bromodomain mutations, suggesting that Rsc4 promotes gene activation. Furthermore, rsc4 mutants displayed defects in the activation of genes involved in nicotinic acid biosynthesis, cell wall integrity, and other pathways. Taken together, Rsc4 bears essential tandem bromodomains that rely on H3 Lys14 acetylation to assist RSC complex for gene activation."

We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers."

Abnormal neurogenesis and neurotransmission have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The kainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK\u2009=\u2009glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an essential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family members, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause developmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown. Herein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay predominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb microdeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression pattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in presynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be responsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of genetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members support this hypothesis. The current observation of a microdeletion involving GRIK3, a kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, and the neurodevelopmental manifestation in the absence of major dysmorphism provides further clinical implication of the possible role of GRIK family glutamate receptors in the pathogenesis of developmental delay."

However, the role of Ser-129 phosphorylation on the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies remains unclear. Here we investigated the neurotoxicity of Ser-129-substituted \u03b1-synuclein in the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (Tg worm) model of synucleinopathy. Tg worms pan-neuronally overexpressing nonphosphorylatable (S129A) \u03b1-synuclein showed severe defects including motor dysfunction, growth retardation, and synaptic abnormalities. In contrast, Tg worms expressing phosphorylation mimic (S129D) \u03b1-synuclein exhibited nearly normal phenotypes. Biochemical fractionation revealed that the level of membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein was significantly increased in S129A-\u03b1-synuclein Tg worms, whereas S129D- as well as A30P-\u03b1-synuclein displayed lower membrane binding properties. Furthermore, A30P/S129A double mutant \u03b1-synuclein did not cause neuronal dysfunction and displayed low membrane binding property. In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, localization of S129A-\u03b1-synuclein to membranes was significantly increased. Finally, gene expression profiling of S129A-Tg worms revealed a dramatic up-regulation of Daf-16/FOXO pathway genes, which likely act against the dysfunction caused by S129A-\u03b1-synuclein.

A segment of DNA mapping very close to the site of the IGL/3' BCR recombination recognized a previously undescribed insertion polymorphism. A combination of molecular hybridization studies and long-range polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a 6-kb full-length long interspersed nuclear element (LINE or L1), here designated L1(IGL), which occupies 19% of alleles in the general population. Although unclonable, DNA sequence analysis by a primer walking approach established that L1(IGL) has features characteristic of an actively retrotransposing element. The L1(IGL) element has a 5' untranslated region, two open reading frames (ORF-1 and ORF-2), a 3' untranslated region and terminates in a poly-A tail. We compared the DNA sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of L1(IGL) with a consensus sequence compiled from seven reported active L1 elements. This analysis indicated that L1(IGL) has high potential for involvement in as yet undetermined somatically and constitutionally acquired disease, not only through recombination mechanisms, but also through retrotransposition events. This full-length L1 element maps close within the IGLlocus to L1.2, one of only nine active L1 elements that have been reported so far.

For each patient, the whole coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations, either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or, most often, by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of all individual exons. A total of 301 sequence variants, including 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations, were identified. As many as 216 or 183 of the genuine mutations, comprising 179 or 161 different ones, can be considered novel when compared to the recent findings of Upadhyaya and Cooper, or to the NNFF mutation database. Mutation-detection efficiencies of the various screening methods were similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for DGS. Some 224 mutations (80.2%) yielded directly or indirectly premature termination codons. These mutations showed even distribution over the whole gene from exon 1 to exon 47. Of all sequence variants determined in our study, <20% represent C-->T or G-->A transitions within a CpG dinucleotide, and only six different mutations also occur in NF1 pseudogenes, with five being typical C-->T transitions in a CpG. Thus, neither frequent deamination of 5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene conversion may account for the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene. As opposed to the truncating mutations, the 28 (10.1%) missense or single-amino-acid-deletion mutations identified clustered in two distinct regions, the GAP-related domain (GRD) and an upstream gene segment comprising exons 11-17. The latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with three cysteine pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as three potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) recognition sites obviously phosphorylated by PKA. Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human and Drosophila strongly suggest significant functional relevance of this region, with major roles played by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16."

Because of this, the need for antiviral therapies in infants and neonates is growing. Currently, there are four antivirals available that are active against CMV: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. At this time, none have approved indications for use in children. Although there are limited data regarding the dose, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and adverse events for some of these antivirals, ganciclovir, and its oral prodrug valganciclovir, have been the best studied in the infant and neonate populations. In general, pharmaceutical PK studies in young children are limited by the constraints of sampling difficulties and blood volume requirements; fewer sampling times and studies may be available for drug evaluation. Given this caveat, ganciclovir and valganciclovir PK in children thus far appears to follow a monocompartmental model, contrary to what has been described in adults. However, when normalized for weight, the volume of distribution, clearance, and half-life of ganciclovir are similar to those found in adults. Given the findings that ganciclovir (and thus valganciclovir) clearance is directly proportionate to renal function, care must be taken when administering the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Recent studies evaluating valganciclovir PK in infants (at a dose of 16 mg/kg every 12 hours) have shown similar areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) to intravenous ganciclovir (at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours), and that these AUCs remain quite stable over a number of weeks. As seen in adults, oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability (4.8% in a pediatric analysis) and is therefore a poor alternative for treating serious CMV infections. Neutropenia is the most frequent toxicity associated with ganciclovir and valganciclovir therapy, whereas significant (and possibly irreversible) renal toxicity can be seen with cidofovir. Foscarnet administration can also result in renal toxicity as well as significant electrolyte imbalances. Several of these drugs have potential toxicities that are of concern, including carcinogenesis, teratogenesis, and azospermia (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir) and deposition into bone or dentition (foscarnet) that may have significant implications when treating an infant. Given these potential ill effects, careful consideration of the indications for the clinical use of these antivirals is necessary before using them for CMV infection in neonates and infants."

Previous studies have shown the ability of EWS-Fli1 chimeric protein to silence p53 activity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of EWS-Fli1 significantly inhibited p300-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys-382 and depletion of EWS-Fli1 protein by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) in EFTs cells facilitated it in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, the deacetylation of p53 by EWS-Fli1 suppressed its transcriptional activity and enhanced mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. On the other hand, immunoprecipitation study shows that N-terminal region of EWS-Fli1 associated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to forms a complex with p53. Knockdown of HDAC1, but not HDAC2 or HDAC3 protein restored the expression of p53 Lys-382 in EFTs cells. Overexpression of HDAC1 also significantly inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. Pharmacologic inhibitor of HDAC, trichostatin A (TSA) promoted p53-p300 interaction and recruitment of p53 Lys-382 to promoter regions of its target genes p21 and Puma, consequently inducing apoptosis and stabilizing the acetylation of p53 at Lys-382 together with the upregulation of p21 and Puma, which were impaired in EFTs cells after the knockdown of p53 expression. Our data indicate EWS-Fli1 might deacetylate p53 to inhibit its transcriptional function and protein stability via the recruitment of HDAC1. These results might elucidate a novel molecular mechanism about the abrogation of p53 pathway by EWS-Fli1 in EFTs pathogenesis."

Since this has implications for hypotheses about the pathogenesis of GCIs, we used a novel panel of antibodies to defined regions throughout alpha-syn in immunohistochemical epitope mapping studies of GCIs in MSA brains. Although the immunostaining profile of GCIs with these antibodies was similar for all MSA brains, there were significant differences in the immunoreactivity of the alpha-syn epitopes detected in GCIs. Notably, carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes were immunodominant in GCIs, but the entire panel of antibodies immunostained cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) in dementia with LBs brain with similar intensity. While the distribution of alpha-syn labeled GCIs paralleled that previously reported using silver stains, antibodies to carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes revealed a previously undescribed burden of GCIs in the MSA hippocampal formation. Finally, Western blots demonstrated detergent insoluble monomeric and high-molecular weight alpha-syn species in GCI rich MSA cerebellar white matter. Collectively, these data indicate that alpha-syn is a prominent component of GCIs in MSA, and that GCIs and LBs may result from cell type specific conformational or post-translational permutations in alpha-syn."

CMT4B is caused by recessively inherited mutations in either myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2) or MTMR13 (also called SET-binding factor 2). MTMR2 encodes a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide-3-phosphatases, which dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2. MTMR13 encodes a large, uncharacterized member of the myotubularin family. The MTMR13 phosphatase domain is catalytically inactive because the essential Cys and Arg residues are absent. Given the genetic association of both MTMR2 and MTMR13 with CMT4B, we investigated the biochemical relationship between these two proteins. We found that the endogenous MTMR2 and MTMR13 proteins are associated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. MTMR2-MTMR13 association is mediated by coiled-coil sequences present in each protein. We also examined the cellular localization of MTMR2 and MTMR13 using fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. We found that (i) MTMR13 is a predominantly membrane-associated protein; (ii) MTMR2 and MTMR13 cofractionate in both a light membrane fraction and a cytosolic fraction; and (iii) MTMR13 membrane association is mediated by the segment of the protein which contains the pseudophosphatase domain. This work, which describes the first cellular or biochemical investigation of the MTMR13 pseudophosphatase protein, suggests that MTMR13 functions in association with MTMR2. Loss of MTMR13 function in CMT4B2 patients may lead to alterations in MTMR2 function and subsequent alterations in 3-phosphoinositide signaling. Such a mechanism would explain the strikingly similar phenotypes of patients with recessive mutations in either MTMR2 or MTMR13."

In a 6-month extension study, long-term (\u22648\u00a0months) treatment with delamanid was associated with a higher incidence of favourable outcomes (i.e. cured or completed all treatment) than short-term (\u22642\u00a0months) treatment, with an accompanying reduction inunfavourable outcomes as defined by the WHO (i.e. pre-specified proportion of TB-positive sputum cultures, death or treatment discontinuation for \u22652\u00a0months without medical approval). Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Although the incidence of QT interval prolongation was higher with delamanid-based therapy, it was not associated with clinical symptoms such as syncope and arrhythmia. In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with MDR-TB. "

Working with isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria, both potassium channel openers (KCOs) stimulate respiration, depolarize the mitochondrial inner membrane and lead to oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD-system in a strict potassium-dependent manner. This is a strong indication for KCO-mediated stimulation of potassium transport at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). Since both diazoxide and nicorandil facilitated swelling of de-energised mitochondria in KSCN buffer at the same concentrations, our results implicate the presence of a mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium channel (mitoK(ATP) channel) in rat skeletal muscle which can modulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation."

Hydroxylation is catalyzed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a specific enzyme, lysyl hydroxylase (LH). The absence of the known ER-specific retrieval motifs in its primary structure and its association with the ER membranes in vivo have suggested that the enzyme is localized in the ER via a novel retention/retrieval mechanism. We have identified here a 40-amino acid C-terminal peptide segment of LH that is able to convert cathepsin D, normally a soluble lysosomal protease, into a membrane-associated protein. The same segment also markedly slows down the transport of the reporter protein from the ER into post-ER compartments, as assessed by our pulse-chase experiments. The retardation efficiency mediated by this C-terminal peptide segment is comparable with that of the intact LH but lower than that of the KDEL receptor-based retrieval mechanism. Within this 40-amino acid segment, the first 25 amino acids appear to be the most crucial ones in terms of membrane association and ER localization, because the last 15 C-terminal amino acids did not possess substantial retardation activity alone. Our findings thus define a short peptide segment very close to the extreme C terminus of LH as the only necessary determinant both for its membrane association and localization in the ER."

The last decade has seen the identification of the disease-causing gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) and the development of mouse models that phenocopy many aspects of the human syndrome, including breathing dysfunction. Recent studies have begun to characterize the breathing phenotype of Mecp2 mutant mice and to define underlying electrophysiological and neurochemical deficits. The picture that is emerging is one of defects in synaptic transmission throughout the brainstem respiratory network associated with abnormal expression in several neurochemical signaling systems, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), biogenic amines and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). Based on such findings, potential therapeutic strategies aimed at improving breathing by targeting deficits in neurochemical signaling are being explored. This review details our current understanding of respiratory dysfunction and underlying mechanisms in RTT with a particular focus on insights gained from mouse models."

While these compounds ionize poorly or not at all when used as such, a strong signal can be obtained of their ionic complexes formed with a basic peptide or protein. The molecular weight of the sulfated oligosaccharide is determined by subtracting the mass of the basic component from that of the complex. Optimization of the experimental conditions resulted in sub-picomole sensitivity, in the elimination of sulfate loss and of the interference from attachment of inorganic cations. Synthetic peptides (Arg-Gly)10 and (Arg-Gly)15 were specifically designed as complexing agents for synthetic and natural heparin fragments up to decasaccharides. Accurate molecular weight determination on chemically homogeneous oligosaccharides (+/- 0.05%) unambiguously identified the number of saccharide units, and the number of O,N-sulfate and N-acetyl groups. For oligosaccharides larger than decasaccharides, a small basic protein, angiogenin (M(r) = 14,120), was used to form the complex (an inhomogeneous hexadecasaccharide fraction was the largest available for this study). For inhomogeneous samples larger than decasaccharides, the mass accuracy is lower (+/- 0.2-0.3%) but still suffices to determine the number of saccharide units present and to estimate the number of sulfate groups, except it is no longer possible to differentiate one sulfate from two N-acetyl groups (delta = 4 Da). However, taking into account known regularities of sulfation and acetylation, the specificity of heparin lyases and chemical degradation steps, the method promises to contribute significantly to the determination of the primary structure of heparin and other sulfated glycosaminoglycans."

The IVS + 1 mutation constituted 2.26% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients and 1.43% among the non-Jewish patients. RecTL, a complex allele containing four single-base-pair changes, occurred in 2.26% of the alleles in Jewish patients and was found in two (1.43%) of the patients of non-Jewish extraction. Another complex allele, designated \"RecNciI\" and containing three single-point mutations, appeared in 7.8% of alleles of non-Jewish patients and in only two (0.56%) of the Jewish families. The prevalence of the L444P mutation among non-Jewish Gaucher patients was 31.43%, while its prevalence among Jewish patients was only 4.24%. The prevalence of two other point mutations--D409H and R463C--was 5.00% and 3.57%, respectively, among non-Jewish patients and was not found among the Jewish Gaucher patient population. The prevalence of the R496H mutation, found so far only among Jewish patients, was 1.13%. The results presented demonstrate that seven mutations identify 90.40% of the mutations among Jewish patients and that these seven mutations allow diagnosis of only 73.52% of the non-Jewish patients. Identification of additional mutant alleles will enhance the accuracy of carrier detection."

We report on four children in whom was diagnosed a neurocristopathy, associating Hirschsprung's disease with a wide spectrum of neurologic abnormalities. The patients included two children presenting the phenotypic features of the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome: distinct dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and mental retardation, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cortical malformations associated with intractable seizures in one child. The third newborn presented with the Haddad syndrome: short-segment Hirschsprung's disease associated with the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome requiring permanent artificial ventilation. In the fourth child, absence of the corpus callosum was associated with mild dysmorphic features, borderline cognitive abilities, and attention-deficit disorder. Therefore, awareness of a possible neurocristopathy associated with neurologic abnormalities should be taken into account in any patient newly diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease to detect the abnormalities early and promptly manage them. A thorough neurologic examination and a developmental assessment, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and electroencephalography, should be performed for any child presenting with an aganglionic megacolon, especially those presenting with seizures, developmental delay, or even congenital hypoventilation."

                    "context": "Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive skin disease with severe skin inflammation and scaling, a specific hair shaft defect and constant allergic manifestations. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor of kazal type 5) encoding LEKTI-1 (lympho-epithelial kazal type related inhibitor type 5) expressed in stratified epithelia. In vitro and in vivo studies in murine models and in NS patients have cast light on the pathogenesis of the disease and shown that LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) and KLK7 activities and to the overactivity of a new epidermal protease, elastase 2 (ELA2). Two main cascades initiated by KLK5 activity have emerged. One results in desmoglein 1 degradation and desmosome cleavage leading to stratum corneum detachment. KLK5 also activates KLK7 and ELA2, which contribute to a defective skin barrier. This facilitates allergen and microbe penetration and generates danger signals leading to caspase 1 activation and the production of active interleukin-1\u03b2. In parallel, KLK5 activates a specific cascade of allergy and inflammation by activating protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors. PAR-2 activation triggers the production of the major pro-Th2 cytokine TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and several inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. Levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) also contribute to allergy in a PAR-2-independent manner. Patient investigations have confirmed these abnormalities and revealed a wide spectrum of disease expression, sometimes associated with residual LEKTI expression. These results have demonstrated that the tight regulation of epidermal protease activity is essential for skin homeostasis and identified new targets for therapeutic intervention. They also provide a link with atopic dermatitis through deregulated protease activity, as recently supported by functional studies of the E420K LEKTI variant."

However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an orthostatic fall of systolic blood pressure less than 30 mmHg, and PD-II (25 cases) with a fall of 30 mmHg or more. Autonomic dysfunctions were more extent in PD-II than in PD-I, because the incidences of anhidrosis, impotence, neurogenic bladder and constipation were higher in PD-II. All of the cases of AF-LB were contained in the previous literatures with reasonably full clinical descriptions. Mean age at onset of the disease was 62.1 +/- 8.7 (mean +/- SD) years old in PD-I, 64.5 +/- 7.5 years old in PD-II and 63.9 +/- 9.0 years old in AF-LB, and no significant differences were found among the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

D1 catalyzes the activation as well as the inactivation of thyroid hormone by outer and inner ring deiodination, respectively. D3 only catalyzes inner ring deiodination. D1 and D3 have been cloned from mammals and amphibians and shown to contain a selenocysteine (Sec) residue. We characterized chicken D1 and D3 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and studied the expression of hepatic D1 and D3 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) during embryonic development. Oligonucleotides based on two amino acid sequences strongly conserved in the different deiodinases (NFGSCTSecP and YIEEAH) were used for reverse transcription-PCR of poly(A+) RNA isolated from embryonic day 17 (E17) chicken liver, resulting in the amplification of two 117-bp DNA fragments. Screening of an E17 chicken liver cDNA library with these probes led to the isolation of two cDNA clones, ECL1711 and ECL1715. The ECL1711 clone was 1360 bp long and lacked a translation start site. Sequence alignment showed that it shared highest sequence identity with D1s from other vertebrates and that the coding sequence probably lacked the first five nucleotides. An ATG start codon was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis, generating a mutant (ECL1711M) with four additional codons (coding for MGTR). The open reading frame of ECL1711M coded for a 249-amino acid protein showing 58-62% identity with mammalian D1s. An in-frame TGA codon was located at position 127, which is translated as Sec in the presence ofa Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) identified in the 3'-untranslated region. Enzyme activity expressed in COS-1 cells by transfection with ECL1711M showed the same catalytic, substrate, and inhibitor specificities as native chicken D1. The ECL1715 clone was 1366 bp long and also lacked a translation start site. Sequence alignment showed that it was most homologous with D3 from other species and that the coding sequence lacked approximately the first 46 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 62-72% identity with the D3 sequences from other species, including a putative Sec residue at a corresponding position. The 3'-untranslated region of ECL1715 also contained a SECIS element. These results indicate that ECL1711 and ECL1715 are near-full-length cDNA clones for chicken D1 and D3 selenoproteins, respectively. The ontogeny of D1 and D3 expression in chicken liver was studied between E14 and 1 day after hatching (C1). D1 activity showed a gradual increase from E14 until C1, whereas D1 mRNA level remained relatively constant. D3 activity and mRNA level were highly significantly correlated, showing an increase from E14 to E17 and a strong decrease thereafter. These results suggest that the regulation of chicken hepatic D3 expression during embryonic development occurs predominantly at the pretranslational level."

However, the proportion of insomniacs who are treated continues to be low, indicating the need for continued development and dissemination of effective therapies. Hypnotic drug development has arguably become more focused in recent years, particularly upon the highly anticipated novel target, the orexin (hypocretin) system. Merck's suvorexant (MK-4305) is the first compound of the so-called dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) class expected to be submitted for FDA approval, with a new drug application anticipated in 2012. While there has also been some new activity in the modulation of well-characterized targets with well-characterized agents, such as CNS histamine receptors with low-dose doxepin, a decades-old antidepressant and GABA(A) with sublingual zolpidem, experience with melatonin and serotonin modulators suggests that other targets also exist. Diversifying insomnia drug targets may expand possibilities for customizing hypnotic administration to individualized patient presentation and mechanistic underpinnings. In addition, it may offer improved avenues for combining medications with non-drug treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)."

The diagnosis of ALS is easy to recognize in its fully developed form but during the early stages both false positive and false negative diagnoses are common. In clinical practice, diagnostic difficulties mostly arise with patients who present either with only upper motor neuron, or with only lower motor neuron signs. It may be difficult to distinguish ALS with clinically predominant lower motor neuron involvement from alternative diagnoses including spinal atrophies of adult onset, Kennedy's disease, inclusion body myositis and motor neuropathies with conduction blocks. The diagnosis of ALS related syndromes (progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis and progressive bulbar palsy) requires the elimination of alternate diagnoses.

In canonical or beta-catenin signaling, DVL forms large molecular supercomplexes at the plasma membrane consisting of Wnt-Fz-LRP5/6-DVL-AXIN. This promotes the disassembly of the beta-catenin destruction machinery, beta-catenin accumulation, and consequent activation of Wnt signaling. Therefore, DVLs are considered to be key regulators that rescue cytoplasmic beta-catenin from degradation. The potential medical importance of DVLs is in both human degenerative disease and cancer. The overexpression of DVL has been shown to potentiate the activation of Wnt signaling and it is now apparent that up-regulation of DVLs is involved in several types of cancer. "

Defective lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (Gla) is responsible for excessive Gb3 accumulation, and one cell sensitive to the effects of Gb3 accumulation is vascular endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with Fabry disease and excessive cellular Gb3. We previously demonstrated that excessive vascular Gb3 in a mouse model of Fabry disease, the Gla-knockout (Gla(-/0)) mouse, results in abnormal vascular function, which includes abnormal endothelium-dependent contractions, a vascular phenomenon known to involve cyclooxygenase (COX). Therefore, we hypothesized that the vasculopathy in the Gla knockout mouse may be due to a vasoactive COX-derived product. To test this hypothesis, vascular reactivity experiments were performed in aortic rings from wild-type (Gla(+/0)) and Gla(-/0) mice in the presence and absence of specific and nonspecific COX inhibitors. Specific inhibition of COX1 or COX2 in endothelium-intact rings from Gla(-/0) mice decreased overall phenylephrine contractility compared with untreated Gla(-/0) rings, whereas COX inhibitors had no effect on contractility in endothelium-denuded rings. Nonspecific inhibition of COX with indomethacin (10 micromol/l) or COX1 inhibition with valeryl salicylate (3 mmol/l) improved endothelial function in rings from Gla(-/0) mice, but COX2 inhibition with NS-398 (1 micromol/l) further increased endothelial dysfunction in rings from Gla(-/0) mice. These results suggest that, in the Gla(-/0) mice, COX1 and COX2 activity are increased and localized in the endothelium, producing vasopressor and vasorelaxant products, which contribute to the Fabry-related vasculopathy."

Strikingly, IFN-gammaR(-/-) and TNFRp55(-/-) mice are considerably more susceptible to infections than inducible nitric oxide synthase(-/-) and p47phox(-/-) mice. Thus we applied transcriptome-profiling studies to identify genes synergistically upregulated by IFN-gamma and TNF in macrophages which are potentially involved in the defense against intracellular pathogens. From a total of 234 regulated genes we found 35 genes that were upregulated by combined effects of IFN-gamma and TNF and were at least 2-fold induced. The majority of these genes are involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. However, we found several genes were poorly characterized with regard to immunological functions. As a prototypic TNF- and IFN-gamma-coregulated gene we characterized the expression and the subcellular localization of immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) in murine macrophages. IRG1 is highly upregulated in murine ANA-1 macrophages by several proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, as well as in spleen and lung of Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, respectively. Furthermore, this study identifies 35 genes that constitute the IFN-gamma/TNF-triggered effector program in innate immunity."

This case represents 0.05 % of a series of 1,973 consecutive thyroidectomies performed in our hospital. More than 80 % of the left thyroid lobe was effaced by fibrosis and inflammation (lymphocytes, 57 IgG4+ plasma cells per 1 high-power field, an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.67, and eosinophils) with extension into the surrounding tissues and occlusive phlebitis. Immunostaining for podoplanin (D2-40) detected signs of increased lymphangiogenesis in the fibroinflammatory areas that were confirmed by electron microscopy. A strong, diffuse stain for podoplanin and transforming growth factor \u00df1 was also detected in the same areas. The increased number of lymphatic vessels in RT is reported for the first time. Our findings support the inclusion of RT within the spectrum of IgG4-related thyroid disease (IgG4-RTD). Although the etiology and physiopathology of IgG4-RTD still remain elusive, the results obtained in the present case suggest the participation of lymphatic vessels in the pathogenesis of RT."

GC-boxes are located at a distance of 15 and 16 nt upstream, respectively, in the native viroid structure, which may act to facilitate initiation.

It has subsequently been approved in the USA for the treatment of patients with CTEPH and also received its first global approval in patients with PAH in the USA. It is undergoing regulatory review for these indications in Europe and for use in patients with CTEPH in Japan.

A unique capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is multiplex genome engineering by delivering a single Cas9 enzyme and two or more single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeted to distinct genomic sites. This approach can be used to simultaneously create multiple DNA breaks or to target multiple transcriptional activators to a single promoter for synergistic enhancement of gene induction. To address the need for uniform and sustained delivery of multiplex CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering tools, we developed a single lentiviral system to express a Cas9 variant, a reporter gene and up to four sgRNAs from independent RNA polymerase III promoters that are incorporated into the vector by a convenient Golden Gate cloning method. Each sgRNA is efficiently expressed and can mediate multiplex gene editing and sustained transcriptional activation in immortalized and primary human cells. This delivery system will be significant to enabling the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome engineering in diverse cell types. "

Though the catalytic domain is only approximately 20% identical to human PTP1B, the Yersinia PTPase contains all of the invariant residues present in eukaryotic PTPases, including the nucleophilic Cys 403 which forms a phosphocysteine intermediate during catalysis. We present here structures of the unliganded (2.5 A resolution) and tungstate-bound (2.6 A) crystal forms which reveal that Cys 403 is positioned at the centre of a distinctive phosphate-binding loop. This loop is at the hub of several hydrogen-bond arrays that not only stabilize a bound oxyanion, but may activate Cys 403 as a reactive thiolate. Binding of tungstate triggers a conformational change that traps the oxyanion and swings Asp 356, an important catalytic residue, by approximately 6 A into the active site.

To better define the function of Rfx6 in early endoderm development we cloned the Xenopus homologue. Expression of rfx6 begins early, showing broad expression throughout the anterior endoderm; at later stages rfx6 expression becomes restricted to the endocrine cells of the gut and pancreas. Morpholino knockdown of rfx6 caused a loss of pancreas marker expression, as well as other abnormalities. Co-injection of exogenous wild-type rfx6 rescued the morpholino phenotype in Xenopus tadpoles, whereas attempts to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype using mutant rfx6 based on Mitchell-Riley patients were unsuccessful. To better define the pleiotropic effects, we performed microarray analyses of gene expression in knockdown foregut tissue. In addition to pancreatic defects, the microarray analyses revealed downregulation of lung, stomach and heart markers and an upregulation of kidney markers. We verified these results using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Based on the different rfx6 expression patterns and our functional analyses, we propose that rfx6 has both early and late functions. In early development Rfx6 plays a broad role, being essential for development of most anterior endodermal organs. At later stages however, Rfx6 function is restricted to endocrine cells."

Formation of Lewy body-like inclusions can be replicated in cultured cells by introducing \u03b1-synuclein fibrils generated in vitro. We used this cell culture model to investigate the autophagy of \u03b1-synuclein inclusions and impaired mitochondria. The intracellular \u03b1-synuclein inclusions immediately underwent phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Simultaneously they were encircled by an adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 and directed to the autophagy-lysosome pathway in HEK293 cell line. Most phospho-\u03b1-synuclein-positive inclusions were degraded in 24 h, however, lysosomal dysfunction with bafilomycin A1 significantly affected their clearance. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by Atg-5 siRNA treatment reduced the incorporation of \u03b1-synuclein inclusions into LC3-positive autophagosomes. Knockdown experiments demonstrated the requirement of p62 for \u03b1-synuclein autophagy. These results demonstrate that \u03b1-synuclein inclusions are preferred targets for p62-dependent autophagy. Next, we investigated the autophagic clearance of impaired mitochondria in \u03b1-synuclein inclusion-containing cells. Impaired mitochondria were almost completely eliminated after mitochondrial uncoupling even in the presence of \u03b1-synuclein inclusions, suggesting that mitochondrial clearance is not prevented by \u03b1-synuclein inclusions in HEK293 cells."

Although yeast DCP1 and DCP2 directly interact, an additional factor, EDC4, promotes DCP1-DCP2 association in metazoan. Here, we elucidate how the human proteins interact to assemble an active decapping complex and how decapped mRNAs are handed over to XRN1. We show that EDC4 serves as a scaffold for complex assembly, providing binding sites for DCP1, DCP2 and XRN1. DCP2 and XRN1 bind simultaneously to the EDC4 C-terminal domain through short linear motifs (SLiMs). Additionally, DCP1 and DCP2 form direct but weak interactions that are facilitated by EDC4. Mutational and functional studies indicate that the docking of DCP1 and DCP2 on the EDC4 scaffold is a critical step for mRNA decapping in vivo. They also revealed a crucial role for a conserved asparagine-arginine containing loop (the NR-loop) in the DCP1 EVH1 domain in DCP2 activation. Our data indicate that DCP2 activation by DCP1 occurs preferentially on the EDC4 scaffold, which may serve to couple DCP2 activation by DCP1 with 5'-to-3' mRNA degradation by XRN1 in human cells. "

The adenovirus early region 4 ORF4 protein (E4orf4) subverts signaling by Src family kinases (SFK) to perturb cellular morphology, membrane traffic, and organellar dynamics and to trigger cell death. Using E4orf4 as a model, we uncovered a functional connection between mitochondria-shaping proteins and the small GTPase Rab11a, a key regulator of polarized transport via recycling endosomes. We found that E4orf4 induced dramatic changes in the morphology of mitochondria along with their mobilization at the vicinity of a polarized actin network typifying E4orf4 action, in a manner controlled by SFK and Rab11a. Mitochondrial remodeling was associated with increased proximity between Rab11a and mitochondrial membranes, changes in fusion-fission dynamics, and mitochondrial relocalization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was regulated by the Rab11a effector protein FIP1/RCP. Knockdown of FIP1/RCP or inhibition of Drp1 markedly impaired mitochondrial remodeling and actin assembly, involving Rab11a-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in E4orf4-induced signaling. A similar mobilization of mitochondria near actin-rich structures was mediated by Rab11 and Drp1 in viral Src-transformed cells and contributed to the biogenesis of podosome rosettes. These findings suggest a role for Rab11a in the trafficking of Drp1 to mitochondria upon SFK activation and unravel a novel functional interplay between Rab11a and mitochondria during reshaping of the cell cytoskeleton, which would facilitate mitochondria redistribution near energy-requiring actin-rich structures.

The I(CaT) in Purkinje cells was completely suppressed by 200 nM kurtoxin, a specific blocker of both Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2 channels. Since only Ca(v)3.2 mRNA is expressed at high levels in Purkinje fibres, being approximately 100-fold more abundant than either Ca(v)3.1 or Ca(v)3.3 mRNAs, it is concluded that the Ca(v)3.2 gene encodes the bulk of the T-type Ca(2+) channels in canine Purkinje cells. This conclusion is consistent with the sensitivity of the current to blockade by Ni(2+) ions (K(D) = 32 microM). For L-type channels, Ca(v)1.2 mRNA was most abundant in Purkinje fibres but a significant level of Ca(v)1.3 mRNA expression was also found. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells."

The alpha- and beta-tubulins are highly conserved. A third member of the tubulin family, gamma-tubulin, plays a role in microtubule nucleation and assembly. Other members of the tubulin family appear to be involved in microtubule nucleation. Microtubule assembly is accompanied by hydrolysis of GTP associated with beta-tubulin so that microtubules consist principally of 'GDP-tubulin' stabilized at the plus end by a short 'cap'. An important property of microtubules is dynamic instability characterized by growth randomly interrupted by pauses and shrinkage. Many proteins interact with microtubules within the cell and are involved in essential functions such as microtubule growth, stabilization, destabilization, and interactions with chromosomes during cell division. The motor proteins kinesin and dynein use microtubules as pathways for transport and are also involved in cell division.

Using recombinant proteins and complementary in vitro binding studies, we identified a multi-protein complex centered on protein phosphatase-1 that includes its muscle specific glycogen-targeting subunit GM and substrate phospholamban. GM interacts directly with phospholamban and this association is mediated by the cytosolic regions of the proteins. Our findings suggest the involvement of GM in mediating formation of the phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex through the direct and independent interactions of GM with both protein phosphatase-1 and phospholamban. Importantly, the protein phosphatase-1/GM/phospholamban complex dissociates upon protein kinase A phosphorylation, indicating its significance in the \u03b2-adrenergic signalling axis. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying fine-tuned regulation of protein phosphatase-1 and its impact on the SERCA2/phospholamban interactome in cardiac function. "

ANG binds at the upstream control element (UCE) of the promoter and enhances promoter occupancy of RNA Pol I as well as the selectivity factor SL1 components TAFI 48 and TAFI 110. We also show that ANG increases the number of actively transcribing rDNA by epigenetic activation through promoter methylation and histone modification. ANG binds to histone H3, inhibits H3K9 methylation, and activates H3K4 methylation as well as H4 acetylation at the rDNA promoter. These data suggest that one of the mechanisms by which ANG stimulates rRNA transcription is through an epigenetic activation of rDNA promoter."

S6K1 is activated by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516 antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1 acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling."

There are several genetically and clinically distinct forms of this disease, and one of them, episodic ataxia type 6, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a glial glutamate transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter-1. So far, reduced glutamate uptake by mutant excitatory amino acid transporter-1 has been thought to be the main pathophysiological process in episodic ataxia type 6. However, excitatory amino acid transporter-1 does not only mediate secondary-active glutamate transport, but also functions as an ion channel. Here, we examined the effects of a disease-associated point mutation, P290R, on glutamate transport, anion current as well as on the subcellular distribution of excitatory amino acid transporter-1 using heterologous expression in mammalian cells. P290R reduces the number of excitatory amino acid transporter-1 in the surface membrane and impairs excitatory amino acid transporter-1-mediated glutamate uptake. Cells expressing P290R excitatory amino acid transporter-1 exhibit larger anion currents than wild-type cells in the absence as well as in the presence of external l-glutamate, despite a lower number of mutant transporters in the surface membrane. Noise analysis revealed unaltered unitary current amplitudes, indicating that P290R modifies opening and closing, and not anion permeation through mutant excitatory amino acid transporter-1 anion channels. These findings identify gain-of-function of excitatory amino acid transporter anion conduction as a pathological process in episodic ataxia. Episodic ataxia type 6 represents the first human disease found to be associated with altered function of excitatory amino acid transporter anion channels and illustrates possible physiological and pathophysiological impacts of this functional mode of this class of glutamate transporters."

We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process."

It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations. A number of other autosomal recessive syndromes include the Shah-Waardenburg, the Bardet-Biedl and Cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndromes and other syndromes related to cholesterol and fat metabolism among others. The genetics of Hirschsprung's disease are highly complex with the majority of known genetic sites relating to the main susceptibility pathways (RET an EDNRB). Non-syndromic non-familial, short-segment HSCR appears to represent a non-Mendelian condition with variable expression and sex-dependent penetrance. Syndromic and familial forms, on the other hand, have complex patterns of inheritance and being reported as autosomal dominant, recessive and polygenic patterns of inheritance. The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in Hirschsprung's disease could also be explained by the involvement of modifier genes, especially in its syndromic forms. In this review, we look at the chromosomal and Mendelian associations and their underlying signalling pathways, to obtain a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in developing aganglionosis of the distal bowel."

However, the CFTR mutation delta F508 is the most common reason for the frequently inherited disease among the Caucasian population. Maturation and processing of delta F508-CFTR is defective which leads to expression of only very little but functional CFTR in the cell membrane.

Using a gain-and-loss-of-function approach in both mouse and human immune cells, we found Irg1 expression levels correlating with the amounts of itaconic acid, a metabolite previously proposed to have an antimicrobial effect. We purified IRG1 protein and identified its cis-aconitate decarboxylating activity in an enzymatic assay. Itaconic acid is an organic compound that inhibits isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, a pathway essential for bacterial growth under specific conditions. Here we show that itaconic acid inhibits the growth of bacteria expressing isocitrate lyase, such as Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, Irg1 gene silencing in macrophages resulted in significantly decreased intracellular itaconic acid levels as well as significantly reduced antimicrobial activity during bacterial infections. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IRG1 links cellular metabolism with immune defense by catalyzing itaconic acid production."

Given the diversity of cellular contexts encountered in eukaryotes, but the remarkable conservation of CBB morphology, we asked whether general mechanistic principles could explain CBB assembly. We analysed the distribution of each component of the human CBB-assembly machinery across eukaryotes as a strategy to generate testable hypotheses. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS6, SAS4/CPAP and BLD10/CEP135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. Unexpectedly, other players (SAK/PLK4, SPD2/CEP192 and CP110) emerged in a taxon-specific manner. We report that gene duplication plays an important role in the evolution of CBB components and show that, in the case of BLD10/CEP135, this is a source of tissue specificity in CBB and flagella biogenesis. Moreover, we observe extreme protein divergence amongst CBB components and show experimentally that there is loss of cross-species complementation among SAK/PLK4 family members, suggesting species-specific adaptations in CBB assembly. We propose that the UNIMOD theory explains the conservation of CBB architecture and that taxon- and tissue-specific molecular innovations, gained through emergence, duplication and divergence, play important roles in coordinating CBB biogenesis and function in different cellular contexts."

Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. In this study, 239 samples obtained from 215 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were tested for the presence of the seven most common mutations in the KRAS gene and the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Among the tested patients, 53.8% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 46.2% were KRAS mutants. Around five percent (5.1%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene. All the patients showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF were wt-KRAS. The concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic tumor tissue samples was 100%. We have shown that the proportions of mutated and non-mutated KRAS in Slovene patients, as well as the proportion of V600E mutations in BRAF is similar to genotyping results reported by other authors. The tested seven KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were mutually exclusive with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non-responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 51.3%."

If amino acid selectivity is compromised, fidelity can be ensured by an inherent AARS editing activity that hydrolyses mischarged tRNAs. Here, we show that the editing activity of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is not required to prevent incorrect isoleucine incorporation. Rather, as shown by kinetic, structural and in vivo approaches, the prime biological function of LeuRS editing is to prevent mis-incorporation of the non-standard amino acid norvaline. This conclusion follows from a reassessment of the discriminatory power of LeuRS against isoleucine and the demonstration that a LeuRS editing-deficient E. coli strain grows normally in high concentrations of isoleucine but not under oxygen deprivation conditions when norvaline accumulates to substantial levels. Thus, AARS-based translational quality control is a key feature for bacterial adaptive response to oxygen deprivation. The non-essential role for editing under normal bacterial growth has important implications for the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents targeting the LeuRS editing site. "

We have now investigated whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of the leukemias that develop in the E\u03bc-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. Similarly to human CLL, these leukemias express stereotyped BCRs that react with autoantigens exposed on the surface of senescent or apoptotic cells, suggesting that they are antigen driven. We show that R788 effectively inhibits BCR signaling in vivo, resulting in reduced proliferation and survival of the malignant B cells and significantly prolonged survival of the treated animals. The growth-inhibitory effect of R788 occurs despite the relatively modest cytotoxic effect in vitro and is independent of basal Syk activity, suggesting that R788 functions primarily by inhibiting antigen-dependent BCR signals. Importantly, the effect of R788 was found to be selective for the malignant clones, as no disturbance in the production of normal B lymphocytes was observed. Collectively, these data provide further rationale for clinical trials with R788 in CLL and establish the BCR-signaling pathway as an important therapeutic target in this disease."

In this study, we used a fusion protein approach to evaluate the contribution of other regions of the E1 protein to nuclear transport. The nearly full-length E1 gene and six non-overlapping subfragments were each fused in-frame with the lacZ gene in a eukaryotic expression vector. Each clone was electroporated into COS-1 cells, and the intracellular location of the E1-beta-galactosidase fusion proteins was determined by immunofluorescence. Only the constructs containing the full-length E1 or a single subregion (E1-259; amino acids 84 to 166) produced fusion proteins that entered the nucleus. Point mutations in the NLS sequences of the E1-259-lacZ construct prevented nuclear translocation of the corresponding fusion protein. This confirms the previous result that the cluster of basic amino acids is critical for nuclear transport. Furthermore, the data obtained in this investigation indicated that the region of E1 containing the NLS sequence was not only necessary, but was also sufficient for nuclear localization. No other region of E1 contained independent nuclear localization activity."

In high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, psoriasin was identified as one of the most abundant transcripts. We have previously shown that psoriasin was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the downregulation of psoriasin by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether psoriasin could have direct effects on endothelial cells. In this study we demonstrated that psoriasin increased VEGF expression in mammary epithelial cells. The treatment of endothelial cells with recombinant psoriasin increased proliferation comparable to that of recombinant VEGF protein. No change in proliferation was seen when endothelial cells were infected with psoriasin-expressing adenoviruses, suggesting that the proliferative effect of psoriasin was mediated by a specific receptor. Treatment with sRAGE, targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), thus inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation enhanced by recombinant psoriasin. We showed that VEGF expression was not induced by hydrogen peroxide, when psoriasin was silenced by shRNA, which led to the hypothesis that psoriasin induces ROS. Indeed, psoriasin was shown to induce ROS in both endothelial and epithelial cells. Moreover, sRAGE inhibited the psoriasin-dependent generation of ROS in endothelial cells. Finally, treatment with antioxidant Bcl-2 protein abolished the effect of psoriasin on endothelial cell proliferation. Our data suggest that psoriasin expression in mammary epithelial cells leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner through RAGE. Psoriasin may therefore play a role in breast cancer progression by promoting oxidative stress response and angiogenesis."

However, not much is known about the regulation of this key process. Here, we found that deletion of Spt20, a structural subunit of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcriptional activation complex, caused a severe cell separation defect. The defect was mainly due to impaired septin ring assembly, as 80% of spt20\u0394 cells lost septin rings at the division sites. Spt20 regulates septin ring assembly partially through the transcriptional activation of mid2(+). Spt20 also interacted with Spn2 and Mid2 in vitro and was associated with other components of the ring in vivo. Spt20 colocalized with the septin ring, but did not separate when the septin ring split. Importantly, Spt20 regulated the stability of the septin ring and was required for the recruitment of Mid2. The transcription-dependent and -independent roles of Spt20 in septin ring assembly highlight a multifaceted regulation of one process by a SAGA subunit. "

Here, we report that hamartin is localized to the centrosome and that phosphorylated hamartin and phosphorylated tuberin co-immunoprecipitate with the mitotic kinase Plk1. Plk1 interacts with the N-terminus of hamartin (amino acids 1-880), which contains two potential Plk1-binding sites (T310 and S332). Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 independent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex. A non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant with an alanine substitution at residue T310 does not interact with Plk1, whereas a non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant at residue S332 in conjunction with alanine mutations at the other CDC2/cyclin B1 sites (T417, S584 and T1047) does not impact hamartin binding to Plk1. Hamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1. Finally, Tsc1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased number of centrosomes and increased DNA content, compared to Tsc1(+/+) cells. Both phenotypes are rescued after pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. RNAi inhibition of Plk1 in Tsc1(-/-) MEFs failed to rescue the increased centrosome number phenotype. These data reveal a novel subcellular localization for hamartin and a novel interaction partner for the hamartin/tuberin complex and implicate hamartin and mTOR in the regulation of centrosome duplication."

A total of 413 Lepidopteran chorion proteins from 9 moths and 1 butterfly species were retrieved. These data were enriched and organised in order to populate LepChorionDB, the first relational database, available on the web, containing Lepidopteran chorion proteins grouped in A and B classes. LepChorionDB may provide insights in future functional and evolutionary studies of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and thus, it will be a useful tool for the Lepidopteran scientific community and Lepidopteran genome annotators, since it also provides access to the two pHMMs developed in this work, which may be used to discriminate A and B class chorion proteins.

In this study, from a panel of 105 potential small-molecule inhibitors, two compounds Tripolin A and Tripolin B, inhibited Aurora A kinase activity in vitro. In human cells however, only Tripolin A acted as an Aurora A inhibitor. We combined in vitro, in vivo single cell and in silico studies to demonstrate the biological action of Tripolin A, a non-ATP competitive inhibitor. Tripolin A reduced the localization of pAurora A on spindle microtubules (MTs), affected centrosome integrity, spindle formation and length, as well as MT dynamics in interphase, consistent with Aurora A inhibition by RNAi or other specific inhibitors, such as MLN8054 or MLN8237. Interestingly, Tripolin A affected the gradient distribution towards the chromosomes, but not the MT binding of HURP (Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein), a MT-associated protein (MAP) and substrate of the Aurora A kinase. Therefore Tripolin A reveals a new way of regulating mitotic MT stabilizers through Aurora A phosphorylation. Tripolin A is predicted to bind Aurora A similarly but not identical to MLN8054, therefore it could be used to dissect pathways orchestrated by Aurora kinases as well as a scaffold for further inhibitor development."

An understanding of the downstream cellular targets of gefitinib will allow the discovery of biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapies and provide information for overcoming gefitinib resistance. In this study, we investigated the role and regulation of FOXM1 in response to gefitinib treatment in breast cancer. Using the gefitinib-sensitive breast carcinoma cell lines BT474 and SKBR3 as well as the resistant lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453, we showed that gefitinib represses the expression of the transcription factor FOXM1 in sensitive, but not resistant, cells. FOXM1 repression by gefitinib is associated with FOXO3a activation and is mediated at the transcriptional level and gene promoter level. These results were verified by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy samples from primary breast cancer patients obtained from a gefitinib neoadjuvant study. We also showed that ectopic expression of an active FOXO3a represses FOXM1 expression, whereas knockdown of FOXO3a expression using small interfering RNA can up-regulate FOXM1 and its downstream targets polo-like kinase, cyclin B1, and CDC25B and rescue sensitive BT474 cells from gefitinib-induced cell proliferative arrest. These results suggest that gefitinib represses FOXM1 expression via FOXO3a in breast cancer. We further showed that overexpression of a wild-type FOXM1 or a constitutively active FOXM1, DeltaN-FOXM1, abrogates the cell death induced by gefitinib, indicating that FOXM1 has a functional role in mediating the gefitinib-induced proliferative arrest and in determining sensitivity to gefitinib. In summary, our study defined FOXM1 as a cellular target and marker of gefitinib activity in breast cancer."

This frequently occurs as a new mutation, manifesting one of the highest documented rates for any transversion in the human genome. To understand the biology of this mutation, we have investigated its parental origin, and the ages of the parents, in 19 families with de novo c.749C>G mutations. All ten informative cases originated from the paternal allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at birth overall was 34.7 years. An exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation (c.1138G>A) of the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasia, as well as for mutations of the related FGFR2 gene causing Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes.

Capsule endoscopy demonstrated a coincident resolution of the bowel wall edema, with a return to normal within approximately 1.5 h of DX-88 administration. This case study demonstrates that DX-88 can produce dramatic clinical benefits in a patient with an acute abdominal HAE attack, resolving both symptoms and pathologic signs. Furthermore, it illustrates the usefulness of videos obtained from capsule endoscopy in identifying the presence of bowel occlusion and demonstrating its subsequent rapid resolution upon administration of DX-88."

Primary cilia are nonmotile sensory organelles present in a single copy on the surface of most growth-arrested or differentiated mammalian cells, and defects in their assembly or function are tightly coupled to many developmental defects, diseases and disorders. In normal tissues, the primary cilium coordinates a series of signal transduction pathways, including Hedgehog, Wnt, PDGFRalpha and integrin signaling. In the kidney, the primary cilium may function as a mechano-, chemo- and osmosensing unit that probes the extracellular environment and transmits signals to the cell via, e.g., polycystins, which depend on ciliary localization for appropriate function. Indeed, hypomorphic mutations in the mouse ift88 (previously called Tg737) gene, which encodes a ciliogenic intraflagellar transport protein, result in malformation of primary cilia, and in the collecting ducts of kidney tubules this is accompanied by development of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While PKD was one of the first diseases to be linked to dysfunctional primary cilia, defects in this organelle have subsequently been associated with many other phenotypes, including cancer, obesity, diabetes as well as a number of developmental defects. Collectively, these disorders of the cilium are now referred to as the ciliopathies. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the structure and function of primary cilia and some of their roles in coordinating signal transduction pathways in mammalian development, health and disease."

We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 470 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, either primary or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. Exercise capacity improved with treprostinil and was unchanged with placebo; the between treatment group difference in median six-minute walking distance was 16 m (p = 0.006). Improvement in exercise capacity was greater in the sicker patients and was dose-related, but independent of disease etiology. Concomitantly, treprostinil significantly improved indices of dyspnea, signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, and hemodynamics. The most common side effect attributed to treprostinil was infusion site pain (85%) leading to premature discontinuation from the study in 8% of patients. Three patients in the treprostinil treatment group presented with an episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conclude that chronic subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil is an effective treatment with an acceptable safety profile in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension."

Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. We previously reported that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins directly associate with the TPR proteins, such as Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), kinesin light chain, Tom70, FKBP52, CyP40, and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), leading to the dissociation of the interactions of the TPR proteins with their target proteins. Therefore, we have hypothesized that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins can interact with CHIP and regulate its function. GST pulldown assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P bind to the TPR domain and lead to interference with the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P are efficient and specific inhibitors of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. Overexpression of S100A2 and S100P suppressed CHIP-chaperone complex-dependent mutant p53 ubiquitination and degradation in Hep3B cells. The association of the S100 proteins with CHIP provides a Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory mechanism for the ubiquitination and degradation of intracellular proteins by the CHIP-proteasome pathway."

However, in contrast to the picture of E. cuniculi and Encephalitozoon hellem, where different strains have been identified, no genetic variability has yet been observed in E. intestinalis. We have analysed tandem repeats included in putative coding sequences which could be used as polymorphic markers in E. intestinalis. Eight candidate loci (M2, M2A, M3, M5, M7, M7A, M8 and PTP1) were established and 9 E. intestinalis cultured strains from North America, South America and Europe were analysed. M2, M7 and PTP1 nucleotide sequences were identical among the different strains and the GenBank sequence. In contrast, we observed variants in 4 markers (M2A, M3, M7A and M8) which did not correspond to their respective reference sequences. The most noticeable finding was that with the M5 marker two genotypes were defined among the different strains studied, demonstrating genotypic variability of E. intestinalis. Although the diversity described is certainly not high, which can be explained by a lower chance of genetic variability in its minimal genome, we have demonstrated that polymorphisms actually exist in E. intestinalis. Epidemiological studies using this genetic marker should now be conducted to elucidate the genetic variability in E. intestinalis and improve our knowledge of the epidemiology of this microsporidia.

Fourteen had mutations in the X-linked emerin gene, while three showed evidence of autosomal inheritance. Twelve of the 14 emerin mutations caused early termination of translation. An in-frame deletion of six amino acids from the C-terminal transmembrane helix caused almost complete absence of emerin from muscle with no localization to the nuclear membrane, although mRNA levels were normal. This shows that mutant emerin proteins are unstable if they are unable to integrate into a membrane. A 22 bp deletion in the promoter region was expected to result in reduced emerin production, but normal amounts of emerin of normal size were found in leucocytes and lymphoblastoid cell lines. This shows that DNA analysis is necessary to exclude emerin mutations in suspected X-linked EDMD. Emerin levels in female carriers often deviated from the expected 50% and this was due, in at least two families, to skewed emerin mRNA expression from the normal and mutated alleles. In one family with a novel deletion of the last three exons of the emerin gene, a carrier had a cardiomyopathy and very low emerin levels (<5% of normal) due to skewed X-inactivation. In the three autosomal cases of EDMD, emerin was normal on western blots of blood cells, which suggests that autosomal EDMD is not caused by indirect reduction of emerin levels."

Gene enhancer elements are thought to exist in either active or poised states distinguishable by chromatin features, but a complete understanding of the regulation of enhancers is lacking. Here, by using mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives, as well as terminally differentiated cells, we report the coexistence of multiple, defined classes of enhancers that serve distinct cellular functions. Specifically, we found that active enhancers can be subclassified based on varying levels of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 and the pSer2/5 forms of RNA polymerase II. The abundance of these histone modifications positively correlates with the expression of associated genes and cellular functions consistent with the identity of the cell type. Poised enhancers can also be subclassified based on presence or absence of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, conservation, genomic location, expression levels of associated genes, and predicted function of associated genes. These findings not only refine the repertoire of histone modifications at both active and poised gene enhancer elements but also raise the possibility that enhancers associated with distinct cellular functions are partitioned based on specific combinations of histone modifications."

In nearly all organs, neoplasms occur that are inherited similar to familial retinoblastoma (Rb). For example, more than 5% of all women suffering from breast cancer belong to breast cancer families in which the occurrence of the malignancy suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Familial colon cancer is associated with several well-known autosomal dominantly inherited polyposis syndromes, and also other susceptibilities without obvious clinical features. Site-specific cancers are often accompanied by other malignancies. In addition, there seem to be predispositions to a wider range of different, but well-defined neoplasms: e.g., adenocarcinomatosis of the colon and the endometrium, or the Li-Fraumeni/SBLA syndrome. The latter shows a spectrum of sarcoma, brain tumours, breast cancer, leukaemias, lung and adenocortical cancer. The genes leading to these types of dominantly inherited predispositions appear to be the tentatively so-called tumour suppressor genes, for which the Rb gene serves as a model. It manifests itself recessively on the level of the individual cell, which means both alleles must be deleted or inactivated before a retinoblast develops into a neoplastic cell. Clinical, epidemiological and molecular genetic studies have yet to establish whether the Rb model can be extended to all other forms of dominantly inherited human cancers."

It is well known that excessive accumulation of lipids leads to several human worldwide diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. LDs' size range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes and is related to the lipid content, but their growth is still a puzzling question. It has been suggested that LDs can grow in size due to the fusion process by which a larger LD is obtained by the merging of two smaller LDs, but these events seems to be rare and difficult to be observed. Many other processes are thought to be involved in the number and growth of LDs, like the de novo formation and the growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in pre-existing droplets. Moreover the number and size of LDs are influenced by the catabolism and the absorption or interaction with other organelles. The comprehension of these processes could help in the confinement of the pathologies related to lipid accumulation. In this study the LDs' size distribution, number and the total volume of immature (n=12), mature (n=12, 10-days differentiated) and lipolytic (n=12) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were considered. More than 11,000 LDs were measured in the 36 cells after Oil Red O staining. In a previous work Monte Carlo simulations were used to mimic the fusion process alone between LDs. We found that, considering the fusion as the only process acting on the LDs, the size distribution in mature adipocytes can be obtained with numerical simulation starting from the size distribution in immature cells provided a very high rate of fusion events. In this paper Monte Carlo simulations were developed to mimic the interaction between LDs taking into account many other processes in addition to fusion (de novo formation and the growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in pre-existing droplets) in order to reproduce the LDs growth and we also simulated the catabolism (fission and the decrease through neutral lipid exit from pre-existing droplets) to reproduce their size reduction observed in lipolytic conditions. The results suggest that each single process, considered alone, can not be considered the only responsible for the size variation observed, but more than one of them, playing together, can quite well reproduce the experimental data."

Interestingly, the majority of patient mutations reside in the CC. The molecular mechanisms underlying the requirement for such a large complex to carry out a monoubiquitination event remain a mystery.

Here we show that a previously uncharacterized anthocyanin MYB-like protein, Beta vulgaris MYB1 (BvMYB1), regulates the betalain pathway in beets. Silencing BvMYB1 downregulates betalain biosynthetic genes and pigmentation, and overexpressing BvMYB1 upregulates them. However, unlike anthocyanin MYBs, BvMYB1 will not interact with bHLH members of heterologous anthocyanin MBW complexes because of identified nonconserved residues. BvMYB1 resides at the historic beet pigment-patterning locus, Y, required for red-fleshed beets. We show that Y and y express different levels of BvMYB1 transcripts. The co-option of a transcription factor regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis would be an important evolutionary event allowing betalains to largely functionally replace anthocyanins. "

However, recent work has shown that single intermediate filaments and bundles are remarkably extensible and elastic in vitro, and therefore well-suited to bearing tensional loads. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intermediate filament network in keratinocytes is extensible and elastic as predicted by the available in vitro data. To do this, we monitored the morphology of fluorescently-tagged intermediate filament networks in cultured human keratinocytes as they were subjected to uniaxial cell strains as high as 133%. We found that keratinocytes not only survived these high strains, but their intermediate filament networks sustained only minor damage at cell strains as high as 100%. Electron microscopy of stretched cells suggests that intermediate filaments are straightened at high cell strains, and therefore likely to be loaded in tension. Furthermore, the buckling behavior of intermediate filament bundles in cells after stretching is consistent with the emerging view that intermediate filaments are far less stiff than the two other major cytoskeletal components F-actin and microtubules. These insights into the mechanical behavior of keratinocytes and the cytokeratin network provide important baseline information for current attempts to understand the biophysical basis of genetic diseases caused by mutations in intermediate filament genes."

Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. We identify Lys-117, which resides near the catalytic triad, as the primary site of ubiquitination in wild type and pathogenic ataxin-3. Further studies indicate that ubiquitin-dependent activation of ataxin-3 at Lys-117 is important for its ability to reduce high molecular weight ubiquitinated species in cells. Ubiquitination at Lys-117 also facilitates the ability of ataxin-3 to induce aggresome formation in cells. Finally, structure-function studies support a model of activation whereby ubiquitination at Lys-117 enhances ataxin-3 activity independent of the known ubiquitin-binding sites in ataxin-3, most likely through a direct conformational change in or near the catalytic domain."

Among patients with JBTS and a cerebello-oculo-renal phenotype, mutations in CEP290 (NPHP6) are the most common genetic lesion. We present a Cep290 gene trap mouse model of JBTS that displays the kidney, eye, and brain abnormalities that define the syndrome. Mutant mice present with cystic kidney disease as neonates. Newborn kidneys contain normal amounts of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef1) and transcription factor 1 (Tcf1) protein, indicating normal function of the Wnt signaling pathway; however, an increase in the protein Gli3 repressor reveals abnormal Hedgehog (Hh) signaling evident in newborn kidneys. Collecting duct cells from mutant mice have abnormal primary cilia and are unable to form spheroid structures in vitro. Treatment of mutant cells with the Hh agonist purmorphamine restored normal spheroid formation. Renal epithelial cells from a JBTS patient with CEP290 mutations showed similar impairments to spheroid formation that could also be partially rescued by exogenous stimulation of Hh signaling. These data implicate abnormal Hh signaling as the cause of NPHP and suggest that Hh agonists may be exploited therapeutically. "

Rat working hearts were used to examine functional interactions between amlodipine and mibefradil. Gallopamil and another T-type-channel blocker, ethosuximide, were included for comparison. Effects of mibefradil, (+)- and (-)-gallopamil on [3H](+)-isradipine binding were studied in membranes from tsA201-cells transfected with alpha(1c)-, alpha(2)delta-, and beta(1a)- or beta(2a)-calcium channel subunits. Mibefradil increased negative inotropic effect of amlodipine, but not of gallopamil. Gallopamil and ethosuximide showed no influence on contractile effects of amlodipine. Furthermore, mibefradil concentration-dependently caused bradycardic rhythm disturbance. The same type of arrhythmia was observed combining low concentrations of mibefradil with amlodipine, or with gallopamil, respectively. Amlodipine alone, or the combination of gallopamil or ethosuximide with amlodipine did not cause any arrhythmia. Binding studies showed a concentration-dependent positive allosteric interaction between [3H](+)-isradipine and mibefradil, but not with [3H](+)-isradipine and gallopamil enantiomers. Molecular and functional evidence points to an interaction between a dihydropyridine and mibefradil.

We report here the identification of 28 S small subunit proteins. Each protein was separated by radical-free high-reducing two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer to identify cDNA sequence by expressed sequence tag data base searches in silico. Twenty one proteins from the small subunit were identified, including 11 new proteins along with their complete cDNA sequences from human and mouse. In addition to these proteins, three new proteins were also identified in the 55 S mitoribosome. We have clearly identified a mitochondrial homologue of S12, which is a key regulatory protein of translation fidelity and a candidate for the autosomal dominant deafness gene, DFNA4. The apoptosis-related protein DAP3 was found to be a component of the small subunit, indicating a new function for the mitoribosome in programmed cell death. In summary, we have mapped a total of 55 proteins from the 55 S mitoribosome on the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels."

We investigated the tissue distribution of the FCN1-3 and the MBL2 genes encoding the ficolins and MBL by quantitative PCR. Recombinant proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1 and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung among the lectin complement pathway initiators.

Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named D4Z4 and mapping to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35) is identified. The progressive pattern of FSHD requires that the severity of symptoms as well as their physical, social and psychological impact be evaluated on a regular basis. A yearly assessment is recommended. Multidisciplinary management of FSHD--consisting of a combination of genetic counselling, functional assessment, an assessment by a physical therapist, prescription of symptomatic therapies and prevention of known complications of this disease--is required. Prescription of physical therapy sessions and orthopedic appliances are to be adapted to the patient's deficiencies and contractures."

One is a C-terminal mutation causing Naxos disease, a recessive syndrome of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and abnormal skin and hair. The other is an N-terminal mutation causing dominant inheritance of ARVC without cutaneous abnormalities. To assess the effects of plakoglobin mutations on a broad range of cell mechanical behavior, we characterized a model system consisting of stably transfected HEK cells which are particularly well suited for analyses of cell migration and adhesion. Both mutations increased the speed of wound healing which appeared to be related to increased cell motility rather than increased cell proliferation. However, the C-terminal mutation led to dramatically decreased cell-cell adhesion, whereas the N-terminal mutation caused a decrease in cell stiffness. These results indicate that different mutations in plakoglobin have markedly disparate effects on cell mechanical behavior, suggesting complex biomechanical roles for this protein."

The pedigrees containing affected dogs suggest monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance and all affected dogs trace back to a single male. Here, we studied the neuropathology of this disease and identified a candidate causative mutation. Peripheral nerve biopsies from affected dogs were examined using semi-thin histology, nerve fibre teasing and electron microscopy. A severe chronic progressive mixed polyneuropathy was observed. Seven affected and 17 related control dogs were genotyped on the 50k canine SNP chip. This allowed us to localize the causative mutation to a 19.5 Mb interval on chromosome 13 by homozygosity mapping. The NDRG1 gene is located within this interval and NDRG1 mutations have been shown to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in humans (CMT4D). Therefore, we considered NDRG1 a positional and functional candidate gene and performed mutation analysis in affected and control Greyhounds. A 10 bp deletion in canine NDRG1 exon 15 (c.1080_1089delTCGCCTGGAC) was perfectly associated with the polyneuropathy phenotype of Greyhound show dogs. The deletion causes a frame shift (p.Arg361SerfsX60) which alters several amino acids before a stop codon is encountered. A reduced level of NDRG1 transcript could be detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analysis demonstrated an absence of NDRG1 protein in peripheral nerve biopsy of an affected Greyhound. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for polyneuropathy in Greyhounds and identified the first genetically characterized canine CMT model which offers an opportunity to gain further insights into the pathobiology and therapy of human NDRG1 associated CMT disease. Selection against this mutation can now be used to eliminate polyneuropathy from Greyhound show dogs."

We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and Hsc70 and Hsp90, both of which can function as components of the CMA pathway. We found that the levels of these interactions were aberrantly increased by the I93M mutation, and that expression of I93M UCH-L1 in cells induced the CMA inhibition-associated increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein, a risk factor for PD. The interactions of UCH-L1 with LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were also abnormally enhanced by carbonyl modification of UCH-L1. We propose that aberrant interactions of UCH-L1 variants with CMA machinery, at least partly, underlie the pathogenesis of I93M UCH-L1-associated PD, and possibly of sporadic PD.

The initial emphasis was directed toward the congenital long QT syndrome and the Brugada syndrome. Recently, the hereditary short QT syndrome has emerged as yet another rare channelopathy. This autosomal dominant syndrome can afflict infants, children, or young adults; often a remarkable family background of sudden cardiac death is elucidated. The electrocardiogram is characterized by a strikingly short QT interval (typically <320 milliseconds); virtual absence of the ST segment; and tall, peaked, narrow-based T waves. There is a marked propensity for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and increased risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. At electrophysiology study, short atrial and ventricular refractory periods are found, with easily inducible atrial fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with programmed electrical stimulation. Gain-of-function mutations in 3 genes encoding potassium channels have been identified, which explain the abbreviated repolarization seen in this condition. The suggested treatment is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, though the possibilities of inappropriate shocks have caused some concern, especially in younger patients. The ability of quinidine and disopyramide to prolong the QT interval has the potential to be effective pharmacological therapy for patients with short QT syndrome, but awaits additional confirmatory clinical data."

Conversely, the 14 subunits in the IFT-B module, with the exception of IFT80, have unknown roles in human disease. To identify additional IFT-B components defective in ciliopathies, we independently performed different mutation analyses: candidate-based sequencing of all IFT-B-encoding genes in 1,467 individuals with a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy or whole-exome resequencing in 63 individuals with ATD. We thereby detected biallelic mutations in the IFT-B-encoding gene IFT172 in 12 families. All affected individuals displayed abnormalities of the thorax and/or long bones, as well as renal, hepatic, or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of ATD or MZSDS. Additionally, cerebellar aplasia or hypoplasia characteristic of Joubert syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 families. Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed disturbed ciliary composition, suggesting alteration of ciliary transport and signaling. Knockdown of ift172 in zebrafish recapitulated the human phenotype and demonstrated a genetic interaction between ift172 and ift80. In summary, we have identified defects in IFT172 as a cause of complex ATD and MZSDS. Our findings link the group of skeletal ciliopathies to an additional IFT-B component, IFT172, similar to what has been shown for IFT-A. "

Studies on X-inactivation in other mammals, although limited when compared with those in the mice, have revealed that, while their inactive X chromosome shares many features with those in the mice, there are marked differences in not only some epigenetic modifications of the inactive X chromosome but also when and how X-inactivation is initiated during early embryonic development. Such differences raise the issue about what extent of the molecular basis of X-inactivation in the mice is commonly shared among others. Recognizing similarities and differences in X-inactivation among mammals may provide further insight into our understanding of not only the evolutionary but also the molecular aspects for the mechanism of X-inactivation. Here, we reviewed species-specific differences in X-inactivation and discussed what these differences may reveal. "

Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. In conditions of attenuated transcription, FAs lose RNA and dissociate into RNA-free FUS complexes that become precursors of large aggresome-like structures. We propose a model of multistep FUS aggregation involving RNA-dependent and RNA-independent stages. This model can be extrapolated to formation of pathological inclusions in human FUSopathies. "

An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib.

The under-expression of PRDX2 observed in DS samples was confirmed by real-time PCR (0.73-fold). To test whether decreased expression is associated with enhanced sensitivity of DS neurons to reactive oxygen species, we down-regulated PRDX2 through stable transfections of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with antisense contructs of the complete PRDX2 coding sequence. In addition, we over-expressed SOD1 and compared the effects of the two genes on cell viability. Cells transfected with either construct showed similar sensitivity to oxidative stress in addition to increased apoptosis under basal conditions and after treatment with oxidative cytotoxic agents. This suggests that the decreased expression of PRDX2 may contribute to the altered redox state in DS at levels comparable to that of the increased expression of SOD1."

Muscle pathology of the mice treated with the vivo-morpholino was improved by showing 44% fewer angular-shaped atrophic myofibers.

The study showed that systemic delivery of the vivo-morpholino reduced the PITX1 expression and improved the muscle phenotypes.

We found that fibroblasts from EDG-1 null embryos did not migrate toward PDGF or SPP, and inhibition of motility correlated with defective activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is required for lamellipodia formation and directional locomotion [Hobson, Rosenfeldt, Barak, Olivera, Poulton, Caron, Milstien, and Spiegel (2001) Science 291, 1800-1803]. Moreover, we showed that PDGF-directed cell migration requires both sphingosine kinase activation and expression of EDG-1, suggesting a functional link between PDGF signalling and EDG-1. Indeed, treatment of wild-type cells with PDGF transactivated EDG-1 as determined by translocation of beta-arrestin and phosphorylation of EDG-1. These findings reveal a new paradigm for receptor cross-communication in which activation of a GPCR by a receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for cell motility.

D2 retrotranslocation also includes deubiquitination by the p97-associated DUB Ataxin-3 (Atx3). Inhibiting Atx3 with eeyarestatin-I did not affect D2:p97 binding but decreased UbD2 retrotranslocation and caused ER accumulation of high-molecular weight UbD2 bands possibly by interfering with the D2-ubiquitin-specific peptidases binding. Once in the cytosol, D2 is delivered to the proteasomes as evidenced by coprecipitation with 19S proteasome subunit S5a and increased colocalization with the 20S proteasome. We conclude that interaction between UbD2 and p97/Atx3 mediates retranslocation of UbD2 to the cytoplasm for terminal degradation in the proteasomes, a pathway that is accelerated by exposure to T4.

This frequently occurs as a new mutation, manifesting one of the highest documented rates for any transversion in the human genome. To understand the biology of this mutation, we have investigated its parental origin, and the ages of the parents, in 19 families with de novo c.749C>G mutations. All ten informative cases originated from the paternal allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at birth overall was 34.7 years. An exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation (c.1138G>A) of the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasia, as well as for mutations of the related FGFR2 gene causing Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes. We conclude that similar biological processes are likely to shape the occurrence of this c.749C>G mutation as for other mutations of FGFR3 as well as FGFR2."

While current therapies are mostly aimed at mitigating associated symptoms, novel therapies targeting the subcellular mechanisms underlying heart failure are emerging. Failing hearts are characterized by reduced contractile properties caused by impaired Ca(2+) cycling between the sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sarcoplasmic/ endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mediates Ca(2+) reuptake into the SR in cardiomyocytes. Of note, the expression level and/or activity of SERCA2a, translating to the quantity of SR Ca(2+) uptake, are significantly reduced in failing hearts. Normalization of the SERCA2a expression level by gene delivery has been shown to restore hampered cardiac functions and ameliorate associated symptoms in pre-clinical as well as clinical studies. SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban, protein phosphatase 1, inhibitor-1, and PKC\u03b1. SERCA2 activity is also regulated by post-translational modifications including SUMOylation and acetylation. In this review, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of SERCA2a activity and the potential therapeutic modalities for the treatment of heart failure."

We identified MDM two binding protein (MTBP) as a factor that interacts with Treslin/TICRR throughout the cell cycle. We show that MTBP depletion by means of small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication by preventing assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) holohelicase during origin firing. Although MTBP has been implicated in the function of the p53 tumor suppressor, we found MTBP is required for DNA replication irrespective of a cell's p53 status. We propose that MTBP acts with Treslin/TICRR to integrate signals from cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways to control the initiation of DNA replication in human cells."

However, the reverse mode of the NCX can cause intracellular Ca(2+) concentration overload, which exacerbates the myocardial tissue injury resulting from ischemia. Although the NCX inhibitor SEA0400 has been shown to therapeutically reduce myocardial injury, no in vivo technique exists to monitor intracellular Ca(2+) fluctuations produced by this drug. Cardiac manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) may indirectly assess Ca(2+) efflux by estimating changes in manganese (Mn(2+)) content in vivo, since Mn(2+) has been suggested as a surrogate marker for Ca(2+). This study used the MEMRI technique to examine the temporal features of cardiac Mn(2+) efflux by implementing a T(1)-mapping method and inhibiting the NCX with SEA0400. The change in (1)H(2)O longitudinal relaxation rate, Delta R(1), in the left ventricular free wall, was calculated at different time points following infusion of 190 nmol/g manganese chloride (MnCl(2)) in healthy adult male mice. The results showed 50% MEMRI signal attenuation at 3.4 +/- 0.6 h post-MnCl(2) infusion without drug intervention. Furthermore, treatment with 50 +/- 0.2 mg/kg of SEA0400 significantly reduced the rate of decrease in Delta R(1). At 4.9-5.9 h post-MnCl(2) infusion, the average Delta R(1) values for the two groups treated with SEA0400 were 2.46 +/- 0.29 and 1.72 +/- 0.24 s(-1) for 50 and 20 mg/kg doses, respectively, as compared to the value of 1.27 +/- 0.28 s(-1) for the control group. When this in vivo data were compared to ex vivo absolute manganese content data, the MEMRI T(1)-mapping technique was shown to effectively quantify Mn(2+) efflux rates in the myocardium. Therefore, combining an NCX inhibitor with MEMRI may be a useful technique for assessing Mn(2+) transport mechanisms and rates in vivo, which may reflect changes in Ca(2+) transport."

NESS038C6 chronic treatment (30 mg/kg/day for 31 days) determined a significant reduction in DIO mice weight relative to that of VH FD. The entity of the effect was comparable to that detected in both SR141716 FD and VH ND groups. Moreover, if compared to VH FD, NESS038C6 FD evidenced: (i) improvement of cardiovascular risk factors; (ii) significant decrease in adipose tissue leptin expression; (iii) increase in mRNA expression of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides and a decrease of anorexigenic peptides; (iv) expression increase of metabolic enzymes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 in the liver; (v) normalization of monoaminergic transporters and neurotrophic expression in mesolimbic area. However, in contrast to the case of rimonabant, the novel CB1 antagonist improved the disrupted expression profile of genes linked to the hunger-satiety circuit, without altering monoaminergic transmission. In conclusion, the novel CB1 antagonist compound NESS038C6 may represent a useful candidate agent for the treatment of obesity and its metabolic complications, without or with reduced side effects relative to those instead observed with rimonabant."

Using Affymetrix 250K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this clinical entity to chromosome 12q21. In one of the families, three siblings were affected, and CNV analysis of the critical region showed a homozygous 3.7 Mb deletion containing the ALX1 (CART1) gene, which encodes the aristaless-like homeobox 1 transcription factor. In the second family we identified a homozygous donor-splice-site mutation (c.531+1G > A) in the ALX1 gene, providing evidence that complete loss of function of ALX1 protein causes severe disruption of early craniofacial development. Unlike loss of its murine ortholog, loss of human ALX1 does not result in neural-tube defects; however, it does severely affect the orchestrated fusion between frontonasal, nasomedial, nasolateral, and maxillary processes during early-stage embryogenesis. This study further expands the spectrum of the recently recognized autosomal-recessive ALX-related FND phenotype in humans."

Invadopodia are membrane protrusions that localize enzymes required for ECM degradation. Little is known about the formation, function, and regulation of invadopodia. Here, we show that invadopodia have two distinct aspects: (a) structural for organizing the cellular actin cytoskeleton to form membrane protrusions and (b) functional for using proteolytic enzyme(s) for ECM degradation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition established that organization of invadopodia structure requires cortactin, whereas protease inhibitor studies identified membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as the key invadopodial enzyme responsible for gelatin matrix degradation in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. The inhibition of invadopodial structure assembly by cortactin depletion resulted in a block of matrix degradation due to failure of invadopodia formation. Either protease inhibition or MT1-MMP siRNA depletion moderately decreased the formation of invadopodial structures that were identified as actin-cortactin accumulations at the ventral cell membrane adherent to matrix. The invadopodia that were able to form upon MT1-MMP inhibition or depletion retained actin-cortactin accumulations but were unable to degrade matrix. Examination of cells at different time points as well as live-cell imaging revealed four distinct invadopodial stages: membrane cortactin aggregation at membranes adherent to matrix, MT1-MMP accumulation at the region of cortactin accumulation, matrix degradation at the invadopodia region, and subsequent cortactin dissociation from the area of continued MT1-MMP accumulation associated with foci of degraded matrix. Based on these results, we propose a stepwise model of invadopodia formation and function."

The sizes of the two chromosome XII homologues were very different: 2600 (L-type) and 1450 kb (S-type). The frequency with which we detected clonal size variation in the diploid, compared to that of the parental clones, was about 15-50% of the progeny clones and the range of the size variation of the homologues was 2580-2680 kb (L-type) and 1340-1500 kb (S-type), respectively. The homologue of the L-type appeared to be more frequently variable than that of the S-type. The size variation was shown to be derived from size changes in the rDNA cluster region, which is present in chromosome XII, by digesting the chromosome with XhoI, whose cutting site is not present in a rDNA repeat unit, and hybridizing to rDNA probes. The clonal size variation was also investigated in haploids from spores after meiosis. The L-type and S-type chromosomes segregated 2:2 in an ascus and the sizes of all the S-type chromosomes were shifted up, compared to the original diploid, though the L-type ones were stable. The S-type sizes of 1340, 1450 and 1780 kb in the original diploids changed into the ranges of 1475-1610 kb, 1520-1680 kb and 1820-2010 kb, respectively, in the segregants. Furthermore, we observed that the size of S-type chromosomes in haploid cells was gradually increasing in mitosis during successive subcultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Most cohesin in higher eukaryotes, in contrast, is dissociated from chromosomes well before anaphase. The universal role of cohesin during anaphase thus remains to be determined. We report here initial characterization of four putative cohesin subunits, Psm1, Psm3, Rad21, and Psc3, in fission yeast. They are essential for sister chromatid cohesion. Immunoprecipitation demonstrates stable complex formation of Rad21 with Psm1 and Psm3 but not with Psc3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that cohesin subunits are enriched in broad centromere regions and that the level of centromere-associated Rad21 did not change from metaphase to anaphase, very different from budding yeast. In contrast, Rad21 containing similar cleavage sites to those of Scc1p/Mcd1p is cleaved specifically in anaphase. This cleavage is essential, although the amount of cleaved product is very small (<5%). Mis4, another sister chromatid cohesion protein, plays an essential role for loading Rad21 on chromatin. A simple model is presented to explain the specific behavior of fission yeast cohesin and why only a tiny fraction of Rad21 is sufficient to be cleaved for normal anaphase."

Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where \"ERRE\" represents \"Esrrb-responsive element\") of the promoter. Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells."

Leptin levels in females with anorexia nervosa (Tanner stage B4 [median]; mean age: 17.8 +/- 1.7 years) were low (2.9 +/- 2.7 microg/L), and were related to body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.71; p = 0.03) and percentage body fat mass (r = 0.78; p = 0.01). Leptin levels of the elite gymnasts were even more decreased (1.2 +/- 0.8 microg/L) caused by the low amount of fat stores. Leptin correlated with BMI (r= 0.77; p = 0.004) and the percentage body fat mass (r = 0.6; p = 0.04). In elite gymnasts leptin levels correlated with CA showing an age-dependent increase (r= 0.59; p = 0.04). Oestradiol was secreted at a low level in both groups (AN: 25.6 +/- 17.4 microg/L; AA: 24.4 +/- 13.5 microg/L). A delay in menarche and a retarded bone maturation occurred in AA. Our results clearly show that leptin levels are low in restrained eaters. Leptin levels represent the fat stores in the body and play a permissive role for female pubertal development. There is evidence that the mechanisms leading to a dysregulation of the reproductive-axis in patients with AN are comparable with those leading to delayed puberty in juvenile elite gymnasts with AA. This implies that AN and AA are overlapping groups and AA can lead to the development of AN."

Strong Rec12 binding coincided with previously identified DSBs at the recombination hotspots ura4A, mbs1, and mbs2 and correlated with DSB formation at a new site. In addition, Rec12 binding corresponded to eight novel conversion hotspots and correlated with crossover density in segments of chromosome I. Notably, Rec12 binding inversely correlated with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, contrary to findings in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although both replication origins and Rec12-binding sites preferred AT-rich gene-free regions, they seemed to exclude each other. We also uncovered a connection between binding sites of Rec12 and meiotic cohesin Rec8. Rec12-binding peaks lay often within 2.5 kb of a Rec8-binding peak. Rec12 binding showed preference for large intergenic regions and was found to bind preferentially near to genes expressed strongly in meiosis. Surprisingly, Rec12 binding was also detected in centromeric core regions, which raises the intriguing possibility that Rec12 plays additional roles in meiotic chromosome dynamics."

The contribution of the two TAF10-containing complexes (TFIID, SAGA) to erythropoiesis remains elusive. By ablating TAF10 specifically in erythroid cells in vivo, we observed a differentiation block accompanied by deregulated GATA1 target genes, including Gata1 itself, suggesting functional cross talk between GATA1 and TAF10. Additionally, we analyzed by mass spectrometry the composition of TFIID and SAGA complexes in mouse and human cells and found that their global integrity is maintained, with minor changes, during erythroid cell differentiation and development. In agreement with our functional data, we show that TAF10 interacts directly with GATA1 and that TAF10 is enriched on the GATA1 locus in human fetal erythroid cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate a cross talk between canonical TFIID and SAGA complexes and cell-specific transcription activators during development and differentiation. "

However, normal values for bladder wall thickness (BWT) in adults have not been established. BWT was measured by suprapubic ultrasonography. Bladder volume was calculated as the product of the ultrasonographic measurements of bladder height, width and depth, and a correction factor (0.6). Three groups were assessed: men with normal lower urinary tracts (n = 172; mean age, 39.9), women with normal lower urinary tracts (n = 166; mean age, 37.8), and men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and clinical benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) (n = 150; mean age, 66.4). For the whole group of men and women with normal bladders, mean BWT was 3.35 mm, and BWT appeared normally distributed. There were a weak negative correlation with bladder volume (r = -0.12, P < 0.003) and a weak positive correlation for BWT and age for both men (r = 0.12, P < 0.014) and women (r = 0.17, P < 0.013). Mean BWT was 3.04 mm in healthy women, 3.33 mm in healthy men, and 3.67 mm in men with LUTS and BPE. Sub-dividing normal men into different age groups showed an increasing mean BWT of 3.08 mm (<20 years, n = 27), 3.25 mm (21-40 years, n = 75), 3.42 mm (41-60 years, n = 39), and 3.57 mm (>60 years, n = 31) for those sub-groups. BWT in normal adult women is 3.0 +/- 1 mm and 3.3 +/- 1. 1 mm in normal adult men. A small increase in BWT with age is seen for both genders, and BWT tends to be greater in men than in women. Men with LUTS and BPE show a moderate increase in BWT. Adjustments for bladder volume are for practical purposes negligible, although there is a small decrease in BWT with increasing volume."

Current therapeutic approaches concentrate on reducing Abeta levels and amyloid plaque load via modifying or inhibiting the generation of Abeta. Based on in vivo two-photon imaging, we present evidence that side effects on the level of dendritic spines may counteract the beneficial potential of these approaches. Two potent gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) and LY450139 (hydroxylvaleryl monobenzocaprolactam), were found to reduce the density of dendritic spines in wild-type mice. In mice deficient for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), both GSIs had no effect on dendritic spine density, demonstrating that gamma-secretase inhibition decreases dendritic spine density via APP. Independent of the effects of gamma-secretase inhibition, we observed a twofold higher density of dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex of adult APP-deficient mice. This observation further supports the notion that APP is involved in the modulation of dendritic spine density--shown here for the first time in vivo."

Although both methylases share some common properties, such as utilization of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and methylation of protein-bound arginine residues, they are distinctly different from each other in molecular weight and in catalytic, as well as the immunological, properties. The MBP-specific protein methylase I (approximately 500 kDa) methylates MBP preferentially (Km = 2 X 10(-7) M) and histone to a much lesser extent (Km = 1 X 10(-4) M), while the histone-specific methylase I (approximately 275 kDa) methylates histone only. Both methylases exhibit two major subunit bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: 100 and 72 kDa for the MBP-specific and 110 and 75 kDa for the histone-specific. At 0.5 mM p-chloromercuribenzoate, about 50% of the MBP-specific enzyme remained as active, while most of the histone-specific enzyme activity was lost. In 2 mM guanidine HCl, approximately 90% of the former enzyme activity remained while nearly complete inactivation of the latter enzyme was observed. The enzymes also exhibited quite different inactivation profiles toward high temperature (45-65 degrees C); MBP-enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees C and was rapidly inactivated at higher temperatures with an inflection point at about 57 degrees C. However, under the identical conditions, histone-enzyme was inactivated progressively and linearly in the same temperature range. Finally, Western immunoblot analysis of polyclonal antibodies directed against either enzyme exhibited no cross-reactivity with the other."

These sequences were compared with the oldest Alu species known from the human genome: dimeric Alu J and S and free Alu monomers. Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. The resulting elements successfully propagated in diverging primate lineages until about approximately 20 Myr ago, conserving similar sequence features and essentially the same Alu RNA secondary structure. We suggest that until that time the same \"retropositional niche\", molecular machinery making possible the proliferation by retroposition, constrained the evolution of Alu elements in extant primate species. These constraints became subsequently relaxed. In the Malagasy prosimians the dimeric Alu continued to amplify after acquiring a 34- to 36-nucleotide extension of their linker segment, whereas in the galago genome the \"retropositional niche\" was occupied by novel short elements."

Equipped with several datasets representing real biological environments, containing a high number of accurately quantified reference proteins, we evaluate five popular low-cost and easily implemented quantification methods (Absolute Protein Expression, Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index, Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification Index, Top3, and MeanInt). Our results demonstrate considerably improved abundance estimates upon implementing accurately quantified reference proteins; that is, using spiked in stable isotope labeled standard peptides or a standard protein mix, to generate a properly calibrated quantification model. We show that only the Top3 method is directly proportional to protein abundance over the full quantification range and is the preferred method in the absence of reference protein measurements. Additionally, we demonstrate that spectral count based quantification methods are associated with higher errors than MS1 peak intensity based methods. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of miscleaved, modified, and shared peptides as well as protein size and the number of employed reference proteins on quantification accuracy. "

Currently available antiarrhythmic medications for the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm have limitations due to the modest efficacy and a potential for adverseeffects. Although substantial progress has been made in AF-ablation techniques, broad application of these nonpharmacological treatment modalities is limited and antiarrhythmic drug treatment is still the cornerstone and the first-line therapy for the majority of AF patients. Improvements in the understanding of the principal pathophysiological mechanisms of AF obtained in the last several years have provided promising treatment opportunities. New therapeutic options are based on the more selective targeting of ion channels and intercellular connection proteins predominantly expressed in the atria, the restoration of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and the prevention of AF-associated electrical and structural remodeling. In this review, we provide a highlight of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms in AF with a relation to the potential therapeutic interventions, and discuss novel findings regarding the current and future pharmacological AF management and recent patents.

All drug-resistant tumors retained their original activating EGFR mutations, and some acquired known mechanisms of resistance including the EGFR T790M mutation or MET gene amplification. Some resistant cancers showed unexpected genetic changes including EGFR amplification and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, whereas others underwent a pronounced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Surprisingly, five resistant tumors (14%) transformed from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and were sensitive to standard SCLC treatments. In three patients, serial biopsies revealed that genetic mechanisms of resistance were lost in the absence of the continued selective pressure of EGFR inhibitor treatment, and such cancers were sensitive to a second round of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and underscore the importance of repeatedly assessing cancers throughout the course of the disease."

The two other are hitherto unreported mutations, including a splice mutation of exon 3 and a nonsense mutation in exon 4. In addition, these four tumors also showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for markers on chromosome 17 in the region of TP53. Malignant NFI tumors are initiated by a somatic inactivation of the second NFI allele.

Self-rotation function analysis indicates the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Biochemical data suggest that the blue colour of the protein is related to dimer formation. Sequence data for the protein are incomplete, but thus far have identified no model for molecular replacement.

Its role in defining decondensed domains of larval polytene chromosomes is well established, but its involvement in transcription regulation has remained controversial. For a first comprehensive molecular characterisation of JIL-1, we generated a high-resolution, chromosome-wide interaction profile of the kinase in Drosophila cells and determined its role in transcription. JIL-1 binds active genes along their entire length. The presence of the kinase is not proportional to average transcription levels or polymerase density. Comparison of JIL-1 association with elongating RNA polymerase and a variety of histone modifications suggests two distinct targeting principles. A basal level of JIL-1 binding can be defined that correlates best with the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, a mark that is placed co-transcriptionally. The additional acetylation of H4K16 defines a second state characterised by approximately twofold elevated JIL-1 levels, which is particularly prominent on the dosage-compensated male X chromosome. Phosphorylation of the histone H3 N-terminus by JIL-1 in vitro is compatible with other tail modifications. In vivo, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, together with acetylation at lysine 14, creates a composite histone mark that is enriched at JIL-1 binding regions. Its depletion by RNA interference leads to a modest, but significant, decrease of transcription from the male X chromosome. Collectively, the results suggest that JIL-1 participates in a complex histone modification network that characterises active, decondensed chromatin. We hypothesise that one specific role of JIL-1 may be to reinforce, rather than to establish, the status of active chromatin through the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10."

When cells are stressed, ANG mediates the production of tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNA (tiRNA), which reprograms protein translation into a survival mechanism. The ribonucleolytic activity of ANG is essential for both processes but how this activity is regulated is unknown. We report here that ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 (RNH1) controls both the localization and activity of ANG. Under growth conditions, ANG is located in the nucleus and is not associated with RNH1 so that the ribonucleolytic activity is retained to ensure rRNA transcription. Cytoplasmic ANG is associated with and inhibited by RNH1 so that random cleavage of cellular RNA is prevented. Under stress conditions, ANG is localized to the cytoplasm and is concentrated in stress granules where it is not associated with RNH1 and thus remains enzymatically active for tiRNA production. By contrast, nuclear ANG is associated with RNH1 in stressed cells to ensure that the enzymatic activity is inhibited and no unnecessary rRNA is produced to save anabolic energy. Knockdown of RNH1 abolished stress-induced relocalization of ANG and decreased cell growth and survival."

Therefore, the proteasome has become an attractive target for the treatment of numerous cancers. Several proteasome inhibitors that target the proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome complex have been developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. These proteasome inhibitors have displayed impressive anti-tumor functions by inducing apoptosis in different tumor types. Further, the proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, and inhibit angiogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, immune and inflammatory responses, and DNA repair response. A number of proteasome inhibitors are now in clinical trials to treat multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Many other proteasome inhibitors with different efficiencies are being developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. Several proteasome inhibitors currently in clinical trials have shown significantly improved anti-tumor activities when combined with other drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, Akt (protein kinase B) inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitors, and lenalidomide.

We show that the nature of changes is similar after speciation or duplication events. However, changes in domain architecture happen at a higher frequency after gene duplication. We suggest that the bias towards protein termini is largely because insertion and deletion of domains at most positions in a protein are likely to disrupt the structure of existing domains. We can also use Pfam to trace the evolution of specific families. For example, the immunoglobulin superfamily can be traced over 500 million years during its expansion into one of the largest families in the human genome. It can be shown that this protein family has its origins in basic animals such as the poriferan sponges where it is found in cell-surface-receptor proteins. We can trace how the structure and sequence of this family diverged during vertebrate evolution into constant and variable domains that are found in the antibodies of our immune system as well as in neural and muscle proteins."

After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome.

The secondary disease accompanied with thyroid patients should also carefully check out due to the interference which some diseases can cause in the amount of serum thyroid hormone, particularly the free thyroxin. The dilemma over thyroid clinical diagnosis occur due to variation on serum thyroid hormone which initiated by other non-thyroidal disorders which can play an important roles in metabolic disorders of thyroid hormone due to the alteration which occur on the serum level of thyroid hormone transporter proteins. The majority of serum thyroid hormones of up to 95-99% are bound to the carrier proteins mainly to Thyroxin-Binding Globulins (TBG), some transthyretin already known as pre-albumin and albumin which are all synthesis in the liver and any modification which alter their production may alter the status of thyroid hormones. It seems TBG, transthyretin and albumin carries 75, 20, 5% of thyroid hormones within blood circulation, respectively. The dilemma facing the thyroid hormones following disruption of thyroid hormone transporter protein synthesis originate from this fact that any alteration of these protein contribute to the alteration of total thyroid and free serum thyroid hormones which are in fact the biologically active form of thyroid hormones. The subsequent of latter implication result in miss-understanding and miss-diagnosis of thyroid function tests, with possible wrongly thyroid clinical care, followed by undesired therapy of otherwise healthy thyroid."

Activation of JNK requires phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TPY activation loop motif [2, 3] and can be reversed by the removal of either phosphate group. Numerous JNK phosphatases including dual-specificity phosphatases [4, 5], have been identified. Many stimuli activate JNK by increasing its rate of phosphorylation; however, JNK dephosphorylation is inhibited in cells after heat shock [6], suggesting that a JNK phosphatase(s) is inactivated. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8]. We have previously expressed M3/6 in the mouse bone marrow cell line BAF3 in order to show that JNK activation by IL-3 is necessary for cell survival and proliferation [9]. Here we report that M3/6 dissociates from JNK and appears in an insoluble fraction after heat shock. These data identify M3/6 as a JNK phosphatase that is inactivated by heat shock and provide a molecular mechanism for the activation of JNK by heat shock."

Two TP53 carriers met Chompret criteria for LFS; none met classic LFS criteria. Although two-thirds of breast cancers in women with TP53 mutations are HER2+, we observed a low prevalence of germline TP53 mutations among unselected young women with HER2+ breast cancer.

In mammals, a single enzyme, P450 17A1, catalyzes both 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and a subsequent 17\u03b1,20-lyase reaction with both Prog and Preg. Teleost fish contain two 17A P450s; zebrafish P450 17A1 catalyzes both 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and lyase reactions with Prog and Preg, and P450 17A2 is more efficient in pregnenolone 17\u03b1-hydroxylation but does not catalyze the lyase reaction, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. P450 17A2 binds all substrates and products, although more loosely than P450 17A1. Pulse-chase and kinetic spectral experiments and modeling established that the two-step P450 17A1 Prog oxidation is more distributive than the Preg reaction, i.e. 17\u03b1-OH product dissociates more prior to the lyase step. The drug orteronel selectively blocked the lyase reaction of P450 17A1 but only in the case of Prog. X-ray crystal structures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 were obtained with the ligand abiraterone and with Prog for P450 17A2. Comparison of the two fish P450 17A-abiraterone structures with human P450 17A1 (DeVore, N. M., and Scott, E. E. (2013) Nature 482, 116-119) showed only a few differences near the active site, despite only \u223c50% identity among the three proteins. The P450 17A2 structure differed in four residues near the heme periphery. These residues may allow the proposed alternative ferric peroxide mechanism for the lyase reaction, or residues removed from the active site may allow conformations that lead to the lyase activity. "

Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic re uptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks."

Afatinib is a novel dual irreversible EGFR/HER2 TKI that has been shown in preclinical studies to potentially prevent, delay or overcome resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs. On this basis, the LUX-Lung clinical trial program has been recently launched for testing this molecule in advanced NSCLC patients. Notably, early results from the randomized LUX-Lung 1 trial indicate that afatinib significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared with placebo in pretreated patients with clinically acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. On the other hand, the LUX-Lung 2 trial shows that afatinib is highly active in the EGFR-mutant subgroup of patients.

Mice with inducible deficiency of \u03b2-glucosidase [Gba(tm1Karl/tm1Karl)Tg(MX1-cre)1Cgn/0] serve as an authentic model of human Gaucher disease; we have recently reported clonal B-cell proliferation accompanied by monoclonal serum paraproteins and cognate tumours in these animals. To explore the relationship between B-cell malignancy and the biochemical defect, we treated Gaucher mice with eliglustat tartrate (GENZ 112638), a potent and selective inhibitor of the first committed step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Twenty-two Gaucher mice received 300\u2009mg/kg of GENZ 112638 daily for 3-10 months from 6 weeks of age. Plasma concentrations of \u03b2-d-glucosylceramide and the unacylated glycosphingolipid, \u03b2-d-glucosylsphingosine, declined. After administration of GENZ 112638 to Gaucher mice for 3-10 months, serum paraproteins were not detected and there was a striking reduction in the malignant lymphoproliferation: neither lymphomas nor plasmacytomas were found in animals that had received the investigational agent. In contrast, 14 out of 60 Gaucher mice without GENZ 112638 treatment developed these tumours; monoclonal paraproteins were detected in plasma from 18 of the 44 age-matched mice with Gaucher disease that had not received GENZ 112638.

The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK catalytic \u03b1-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links between AMPK-\u03b1 isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG association of AMPK-\u03b12, but not AMPK-\u03b11. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered with SG formation. Second, AMPK-\u03b1 knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, overexpression of mutant \u03b1-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG parameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-\u03b12 binding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in SGs. Collectively, our data define the master metabolic regulator AMPK as a novel SG constituent that also controls their biogenesis. "

The serum samples were collected in collaboration with the obstetricians of the region of West-Mecklenburg and North-West-Brandenburg. Laboratory testing using radioimmunoassays was performed between weeks 15 and 20 of gestation, all serum specimens being investigated in only one institution. The original alpha-software from Wald et al. was the basis for calculating the statistical risk for Down's syndrome. Pregnant women with a high risk for Down's syndrome (cutoff > or = 1:250) were taken care of in a special outpatient clinic including procedures like amniocentesis and fetal blood sampling. Amongst 5071 pregnant women, 21 fetal anomalies were seen. Five cases of Down's syndrome, three of trisomy 18, one trisomy 13, two cases of triploidy and four cases of open neural tube defects, one 46 xy/45 x mosaic karyotype and one case of gastroschisis could be diagnosed correctly. One case of trisomy 21, one case of trisomy 18 and two open neural tube defects showed false negative results. Using the cutoff of 1:250 for prenatal detection of Down's syndrome and performing ultrasound routinely to determine gestational age, the sensitivity of the \"triple-test\" was 83.33% having a specificity of 92.68%.

Control CT studies after evacuation of hematomas revealed arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa and all patients were qualified for delayed cystocisternostomy by open craniotomy. Indirect signs of presence of arachnoid cysts in the form of bony abnormalities and expanded the middle cranial fossa in the first CT were seen in all patients. Cysts were asymptomatic until the injury in all cases. The volumes of cysts in MRI scans were: 17.8 ml, 52.9 ml and 92.4 ml, respectively. All cysts were type II according to Galassi classification. After control MRI described above made to evaluate cyst appearance, delayed cystocisternostomy to basal cisterns was undertaken in two cases with full success. No complications were observed. The third patient refused surgery. During surgery the thick and non-transparent medial cyst wall and arachnoidea of tentorial notch cisterns were observed impeding the exact identification of neurovascular structures. In our opinion arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa revealed as subdural hematoma should be operated on in two stages: in the first step subdural hematoma should be evacuated and in the second step cystocisternostomy should be performed. With regard to observed morphological changes of arachnoidea and cyst walls we think that open cystocisternostomy is treatment of choice in these cases."

Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. We show that progesterone receptor (PR) signaling failed to induce RANKL in PR(+) breast cancer cell lines and in dissociated, cultured breast epithelial cells. In clinical specimens from healthy donors and intact breast tissue microstructures, hormone response was maintained and RANKL expression was under progesterone control, which increased RNA stability. RANKL was sufficient to trigger cell proliferation and was required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The findings were validated in vivo where RANKL protein expression in the breast epithelium correlated with serum progesterone levels and the protein was expressed in a subset of luminal cells that express PR. Thus, important hormonal control mechanisms are conserved across species, making RANKL a potential target in breast cancer treatment and prevention."

Mycobacteria possess several MutT proteins. Here, we purified recombinant M. tuberculosis MutT2 (MtuMutT2) and M. smegmatis MutT2 (MsmMutT2) proteins from M. tuberculosis (a slow grower) and M. smegmatis (fast growing model mycobacteria), respectively, for their biochemical characterization. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. Determination of kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) revealed that while MtuMutT2 hydrolyzes dCTP nearly four times better than it does 8-oxo-dGTP, MsmMutT2 hydrolyzes them nearly equally. Also, MsmMutT2 is about 14 times more efficient than MtuMutT2 in its catalytic activity of hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP. Consistent with these observations, MsmMutT2 but not MtuMutT2 rescues E. coli for MutT deficiency by decreasing both the mutation frequency and A-to-C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency). We discuss these findings in the context of the physiological significance of MutT proteins."

By DNaseI hypersensitivity assays, we show here that overexpression of the MAR binding proteins SMAR1 and Cux/CDP modulate the chromatin structure at MARbeta. We further demonstrate that the silencer function of MARbeta is mediated independently by SMAR1 and Cux/CDP as judged by their ability to repress Ebeta-dependent reporter gene expression. Moreover, the repressor activity of SMAR1 is strongly enhanced in the presence of Cux/CDP. These two proteins physically interact with each other and colocalize within the perinuclear region through a SMAR1 domain required for repression. The repression domain of SMAR1 is separate from the MARbeta binding domain and contains a nuclear localization signal and an arginine-serine (RS)-rich domain, characteristic of pre-mRNA splicing regulators. Our data suggest that at the double positive stage of T cell development, cis-acting MARbeta elements recruit the strong negative regulators Cux and SMAR1 to control Ebeta-mediated recombination and transcription."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314, which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation. These results suggest that mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314. "

Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. Interestingly, there is a significant overlap between RA susceptibility genes and those of other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes, which suggests common pathogenic mechanisms. Genetic analyses may not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA, but may also open new avenues for therapeutic approaches, because overactive immune-signaling pathways might specifically be addressed by biologic therapies. However, the predictive value of many of the recent findings of large-scale genetic analyses in identifying new genetic polymorphisms remains low.

PTEN is the second most frequently mutated gene in human cancer after p53. Germline mutations of PTEN have been found in cancer susceptibility syndromes, such as Cowden syndrome, in which over 80% of patients have mutations of PTEN. Homozygous deletion of Pten causes embryonic lethality, suggesting that PTEN is essential for embryonic development. Mice heterozygous for Pten develop spontaneous tumors in a variety of organs comparable with the spectrum of its mutations in human cancer. The mechanisms of PTEN functions in tumor suppression are currently under intense investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that PTEN plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that loss of PTEN leads to massive alterations of chromosomes. The tumor suppressor p53 is known as a guardian of the genome that mediates the cellular response to environmental stress, leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. Through completely different mechanisms, PTEN also protects the genome from instability. Thus, we propose that PTEN is a new guardian of the genome. In this review, we will discuss new discoveries on the role of PTEN in tumor suppression and explore mechanisms by which PTEN maintains genomic stability."

The risk of SCD in athletes is higher than in non-athletes because of several factors associated with sports activity that increase the risk in people with an underlying cardiovascular abnormality. A clear gender difference in the incidence of SCD exists in young athletes, with the risk in male athletes being up to 9 times higher than in female athletes. The most common causes of SCD in young athletes is underlying inherited/congenital cardiac disease, such as cardiomyopathies, congenital coronary anomalies and ion channelopathies. Blunt chest trauma also may cause ventricular fibrillation in a structurally normal heart, known as commotio cordis. Although geographical differences in the causes of SCD in young athletes have been reported, these disparities are more likely to be related to the type and implementation of pre-participation screening leading to the identification of athletes at risk, rather than reflecting a truly different ethiology. More studies are needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of diseases known to cause SCD in young athletes."

The disorder is characterized by an abnormally short QT interval (<300 ms) and a propensity to atrial fibrillation, sudden cardiac death or both. As in the case of long QT syndrome, more than one relevant genetic mutation has been identified that can lead to a short QT interval on electrocardiography; so far two have been identified. Shortening of the effective refractory period combined with increased dispersion of repolarization is the likely substrate for re-entry and life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. Thus far, 22 people have been classified as having short QT syndrome: 15 from the actual measurement of a short QT interval on electrocardiograms and 7 by history after they died from sudden cardiac death. Several cases, especially among children, have probably been overlooked, since the shortness of the QT interval becomes apparent only at heart rates less than 80 beats/min. The best form of treatment is still unknown, but prevention of atrial fibrillation has been accomplished by propafenone. Implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is recommended for prevention of sudden cardiac death."

Consequently, impairments in synapse formation or synaptic transmission are thought to be responsible for several types of mental disabilities. BRAG1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Arf6 that localizes to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Mutations in BRAG1 have been identified in families with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations mapped to either the catalytic domain or an IQ-like motif; however, the pathophysiological basis of these mutations remains unknown. Here, we show that the BRAG1 IQ motif binds apo-calmodulin (CaM), and that calcium-induced CaM release triggers a reversible conformational change in human BRAG1. We demonstrate that BRAG1 activity, stimulated by activation of NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors, depresses AMPA receptor (AMPA-R)-mediated transmission via JNK-mediated synaptic removal of GluA1-containing AMPA-Rs in rat hippocampal neurons. Importantly, a BRAG1 mutant that fails to activate Arf6 also fails to depress AMPA-R signaling, indicating that Arf6 activity is necessary for this process. Conversely, a mutation in the BRAG1 IQ-like motif that impairs CaM binding results in hyperactivation of Arf6 signaling and constitutive depression of AMPA transmission. Our findings reveal a role for BRAG1 in response to neuronal activity with possible clinical relevance to nonsyndromic XLID."

We quantified differences in structural disorder and dynamics for an open conformation of SERCA versus closed structures and observed that dynamic motions of SERCA cytoplasmic domains decreased with decreasing domain-domain separation distance. The results are useful for interpretation of recent intramolecular F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance measurements obtained for SERCA fused to fluorescent protein tags. Those previous physical measurements revealed several discrete structural substates and suggested open conformations of SERCA are more dynamic than compact conformations. The present simulations support this hypothesis and provide additional details of SERCA molecular mechanisms. Specifically, all-atoms simulations revealed large-scale translational and rotational motions of the SERCA N-domain relative to the A- and P-domains during the transition from an open to a closed headpiece conformation over the course of a 400 ns trajectory. The open-to-closed structural transition was accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition mediated by an initial interaction of an N-domain loop (N\u03b25-\u03b26, residues 426-436) with residues 133-139 of the A-domain. Mutation of three negatively charged N-domain loop residues abolished the disorder-to-order transition and prevented the initial domain-domain interaction and subsequent closure of the cytoplasmic headpiece. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were in harmony with all-atoms simulations and physical measurements and revealed a close communication between fluorescent protein tags and the domain to which they were fused. The data indicate that previous intramolecular FRET distance measurements report SERCA structure changes with high fidelity and suggest a structural mechanism that facilitates the closure of the SERCA cytoplasmic headpiece.

Normal activities were measured in samples from the father and younger sister but a partial deficiency (43% of control serum) was found in the mother. Chromosome studies on the patient revealed a partial deletion of the long arm of one X-chromosome, most probably of band Xq25, which was not inherited from either parent.

Resting astrocytes form a network that is interconnected through gap junctions, composed mainly of connexin43 (Cx43) protein. Although astrocytic gap junctional connectivity is known to be altered in many CNS pathologies, little is known about Cx43 expression in inflammatory demyelinating disease. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of Cx43 in spinal cords of EAE mice compared with healthy controls. Lumbar ventral white matter areas were heavily infiltrated with CD11beta-immunoreactive monocytes, and within these infiltrated regions loss of Cx43 immunoreactivity was evident. These regions also showed axonal dystrophy, demonstrated by the abnormally dephosphorylated heavy-chain neurofilament proteins. Astrocytes in these Cx43-depleted lesions were strongly glial fibrillary acidic protein reactive. Significant loss (38%) of Cx43 protein in EAE mouse at the lumbar portion of spinal cords was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Decreased Cx43 transcript level was also observed on cDNA microarray analysis. In addition to changes in Cx43 expression, numerous other genes were altered, including those encoding adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins. Our data support the notion that, in addition to damage of myelinating glia, altered astrocyte connectivity is a prominent feature of inflammatory demyelination."

Both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways converge on phosphorylation of Ser(535) within the IFNAR1 degron leading to recruitment of beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase and concomitant ubiquitination and degradation. Casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1 alpha) was shown to directly phosphorylate Ser(535) within the ligand-independent pathway. Yet given the constitutive activity of CK1 alpha, it remained unclear how this pathway is stimulated by UPR. Here we report that induction of UPR promotes the phosphorylation of a proximal residue, Ser(532), in a pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase-dependent manner. This serine serves as a priming site that promotes subsequent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within its degron by CK1 alpha. These events play an important role in regulating ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 as well as the extent of Type I interferon signaling."

This two-protein prion driven by the Q/N-rich prion domains of Sup35 and Tia1/Pub1 can be visualized as distinctive line structures along tubulin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we find that tubulin-associated complex containing Pub1 and Sup35 oligomers normally exists in yeast, and its assembly depends on prion domains of Pub1 and Sup35. This Sup35/Pub1 complex, which also contains TUB1 mRNA and components of translation machinery, is important for the integrity of the tubulin cytoskeleton: PUB1 disruption and Sup35 depletion from the complex lead to cytoskeletal defects. We propose that the complex is implicated in protein synthesis at the site of microtubule assembly. Thus our study identifies the role for prion domains in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. "

We have isolated a 1.18 kb alfalfa cDNA (pIFRalf1) which, when expressed in Escherichia coli, converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin stereospecifically to (3R)-vestitone, as would be predicted for IFR from alfalfa. The calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide (35,400) derived from the 954 bp open reading frame compares favorably to estimated Mrs determined for IFR proteins purified from other legumes. The transcript (1.4 kb) is highly induced in elicited alfalfa cell cultures. The kinetics of induction are consistent with the appearance of IFR activity, the accumulation of medicarpin, and the observed induction of other enzymes in the pathway. Low levels of IFR transcripts were found in healthy plant parts (roots and nodules) which accumulate low levels of a medicarpin glucoside. IFR appears to be encoded by a single gene in alfalfa.

Moreover, Ser(67) of inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain. Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1 was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors opposed increases in striatal diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 levels. Phosphomimetic mutation of Ser(65) and/or Ser(67) did not convert inhibitor-1 into a protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 is a poor substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These observations extend earlier studies regarding the function of phospho-Ser(67) and underscore the possibility that phosphorylation in this region of inhibitor-1 by multiple protein kinases may serve as an integrative signaling mechanism that governs the responsiveness of inhibitor-1 to cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation."

These findings imply that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is involved in the formation of P-bodies and stress granules. To verify these observations, we examined whether another Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (RA) affected P-bodies and stress granules. Treatment with RA reduced the level of the Hsp90 client protein Argonaute 2 and the number of P-bodies. Although stress granules still assembled in RA-treated cells upon heat shock, they were smaller and more dispersed in the cytoplasm than those in untreated cells. Furthermore eIF4E and eIF4E-transporter were dissociated selectively from stress granules in RA-treated cells. These observations were comparable to those obtained upon treatment with GA in our previous work. Thus, we conclude that abrogation of the chaperone activity of Hsp90 affects P-body formation and the integrity of stress granules."

However, this example also demonstrates that successful implementation of pharmacogenetic screening requires that a range of criteria be adequately addressed. These include pharmaceutical factors (e.g. lack of alternative treatments with similar or improved cost effectiveness, safety, and efficacy), clinical factors (e.g. accurate diagnosis of the adverse event, in this case provided by clinical diagnostic criteria and adjunctive epicutaneous patch testing), sufficient objective evidence of the test's predictive value and generalizability (in this case provided by the first large-scale randomized trial of a pharmacogenetic test), as well as availability of quality-assured laboratory services that are responsive to the needs of targeted genetic screening. This example is intended to serve as a precedent for other pharmacogenetic screening strategies, particularly those aimed at reducing rates of serious drug hypersensitivity reactions in clinical practice."

The biological mechanisms behind this side effect are not fully comprehended although involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems has been suggested. The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were performed before and after local L-DOPA application in the striatum. In addition, effects from the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OHDPAT; 1 mg/kg) was assessed on glutamate release and on dyskinetic behavior. The results revealed a bilateral \u2248 30% reduction of basal extracellular glutamate concentration and attenuated potassium-evoked glutamate release after a unilateral dopamine-depletion in L-DOPA na\u00efve animals. In dyskinetic subjects, basal glutamate concentration was comparable to normal controls, although potassium-evoked glutamate release was reduced to similar levels as in drug na\u00efve dopamine-lesioned animals. Furthermore, acute striatal L-DOPA administration attenuated glutamate release in all groups, except in the dopamine-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic animals. Co-administration of 8-OHDPAT and L-DOPA decreased dyskinesia in dopamine-lesioned animals, but did not affect potassium-evoked glutamate release, which was seen in normal animals. These findings indicate altered glutamate transmission upon dopamine-depletion and dyskinesia."

Plant fitness and productivity depend directly on a balance between excitations in the photosynthetic apparatus, generated by captured light quanta, and the rate of photochemical processes. Excess excitation energy leads to oxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and entire organism and therefore the balance between the excitation density and photosynthesis requires precise and efficient regulation, operating also at the level of antenna complexes. We show that illumination of the isolated LHCII leads to isomerization of the protein-bound neoxanthin from conformation 9'-cis to 9',13- and 9',13'-dicis forms. At the same time light-driven excitation quenching is observed, manifested by a decrease in chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity and shortened fluorescence lifetimes. Both processes, the neoxanthin isomerization and the chlorophyll excitation quenching, are reversible in dim light. The results of the 77K florescence measurements of LHCII show that illumination is associated with appearance of the low-energy states, which can serve as energy traps in the pigment-protein complex subjected to excess excitation. Possible sequence of the molecular events is proposed, leading to a protective excess excitation energy quenching: neoxanthin photo-isomerization\u2192formation of LHCII supramolecular structures which potentiate creation of energy traps\u2192excitation quenching."

We previously published the exon-intron organization of the human gene, but did not functionally analyze the 5' flanking region. We now provide a description of this GC-rich region which includes one potential YY1 element and one potential SP1 binding site. There are 13 GGC trinucleotides within the first 150 bp preceding the initiation codon. The 5' end of intron 1 contains six potential Sp1 binding sites, one AP1 binding site, and eight AP2 binding sites. A construct containing nucleotides -176 to -24 had the strongest promoter activity using a vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. We also provide evidence for the presence of inhibitory sequences located immediately upstream of the promoter region, and within the first 234 nucleotides of intron 1.

CSQ-1 shows moderate similarity (50% similarity, 30% identity) to rabbit skeletal calsequestrin. Unlike mammals, which have two different genes encoding cardiac and fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoforms, csq-1 is the only calsequestrin gene in the C. elegans genome. We show that csq-1 is highly expressed in the body-wall muscles, beginning in mid-embryogenesis and maintained through the adult stage. In body-wall muscle cells, CSQ-1 is localized to sarcoplasmic membranes surrounding sarcomeric structures, in the regions where ryanodine receptors (UNC-68) are located. Mutation in UNC-68 affects CSQ-1 localization, suggesting that the two possibly interact in vivo. Genetic analyses of chromosomal deficiency mutants deleting csq-1 show that CSQ-1 is not essential for initiation of embryonic muscle formation and contraction. Furthermore, double-stranded RNA injection resulted in animals completely lacking CSQ-1 in body-wall muscles with no observable defects in locomotion. These findings suggest that although CSQ-1 is one of the major calcium-binding proteins in the body-wall muscles of C. elegans, it is not essential for body-wall muscle formation and contraction."

Due to the lack of pathognomonic morphological or biomolecular markers, HNPCC has traditionally posed unique problems to clinicians and geneticists alike, both in terms of diagnosis and clinical management. Recently, novel insight into the pathogenesis of this syndrome has been provided by the identification of its molecular basis. In HNPCC families, germline mutations in any of four genes encoding proteins of a specialized DNA repair system, the mismatch repair, predispose to cancer development. Mutations in mismatch repair genes lead to an overall increase of the mutation rate and are associated with a phenotype of length instability of microsatellite loci. The present report summarizes the clinicopathological aspects of HNPCC and reviews the most recent molecular and biochemical findings."

The patient is a Japanese boy with acanthosis nigricans, lack of subcutaneous fat, hirsutism, thick lips, gum hypertrophy and extremely high insulin levels (6702 mU/mL).  He was as having identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in INSR (p.T910M and p. E1047K).  At 24 day-old, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rh-IGF1) treatment was started because of poor weight gain.  At 2 years old, the patient's serum glucose level and HbA1C value had worsened, and both a bolus of rh-IGF-1 and a subcutaneous injection of a rapid-acting insulin analog after meals, in addition to \u03b1-glycosidase inhibitor, were initiated from 2 years onward.  Oxygen administration and biphasic positive airway pressure treatment were also initiated from 2 years old due to upper airway obstruction with adenoidal hypertrophy.  In the experiments conducted using COS7 cells homozygously transfected with the INSR mutation, T910M INSR failed to process the proreceptor and decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.  E1047K INSR resulted in a complete absence of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.  These findings suggest the near absence of INSR in this patient.  We consider that the rhIGF1 treatment contributed to his long survival, but it was not able to prevent his diabetic condition.  Our report provides important insights into the function of INSR, and for the treatment of leprechaunism."

Diagnostic criteria included the finding of granular IgA deposits in the skin of all patients. The mean age at onset of the rash was 7 X 2 years and favoured sites were the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Symptoms suggesting small intestinal disease were rare but in 35 (61%) of the children subtotal villous atrophy and in 16 (28%) partial villous atrophy were found on jejunal biopsy. Eighteen children underwent a second biopsy after a mean of 21 months on a gluten free diet; villous height was found to be increased and the intraepithelial lymphocyte count decreased in all these patients. Gluten challenge caused a reversal in the two children who underwent a third biopsy. The effect of the gluten free diet on the rash was examined in Finnish children by observing the daily requirements of dapsone, a drug used to control the rash at the beginning of the diet. Eight (67%) of the 12 children were able to stop taking dapsone after a mean of 11 months on the diet and all three patients treated with diet alone became asymptomatic after three to 6 months on the diet. These results confirm that most children with dermatitis herpetiformis have jejunal villous atrophy, though they rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms. The central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal biopsy."

The general Eurasian continental east-to-west pattern of the spread of TBEV was confirmed at the regional level but is interlaced with spreading that arises because of local geography and anthropogenic influence. This spread is reflected by the disease pattern in the Czech Republic that has been observed since 1991.

Recently, the multi-ligand receptor sortilin has also been implicated in this transport, but the transport carriers involved herein have not been identified. By quantitative immuno-electron microscopy, we localized endogenous sortilin of HepG2 cells predominantly to the TGN and endosomes. In the TGN, sortilin colocalized with MPRs in the same clathrin-coated vesicles. In endosomes, sortilin and MPRs concentrated in sorting nexin 1 (SNX1)-positive buds and vesicles. SNX1 depletion by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased pools of sortilin in the TGN and an increase in lysosomal degradation. These data indicate that sortilin and MPRs recycle to the TGN in SNX1-dependent carriers, which we named endosome-to-TGN transport carriers (ETCs). Notably, ETCs emerge from early endosomes (EE), lack recycling plasma membrane proteins and by three-dimensional electron tomography exhibit unique structural features. Hence, ETCs are distinct from hitherto described EE-derived membranes involved in recycling. Our data emphasize an important role of EEs in recycling to the TGN and indicate that different, specialized exit events occur on the same EE vacuole."

Techniques such as the traditional Papanicolaou test and the newer liquid-based cytology allow for the early detection of cervical abnormalities prior to the development of invasive cervical cancer. As oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for cervical cancer, HPV-DNA testing has also been proposed as a routine screening method for the general population. Screening limitations, such as adherence, test sensitivity and specificity, access, and cost-effectiveness are reflected in current screening guidelines. The development of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccines is a major milestone in cervical cancer prevention. These vaccines protect against the initial infection of certain oncogenic HPV types, and therefore prevent the development of cervical dysplasia, precancerous lesions, and cervical cancer. Considering routine cervical cancer vaccination in adolescent girls, screening guidelines must adapt in order to retain efficient and cost-effective prevention measures. Although the true epidemiological and economic impact of cervical cancer vaccines cannot be immediately realized, mathematical models predict various scenarios in which vaccination, in addition to cervical screening, will be cost-effective and further reduce cervical cancer disease."

This study aimed to investigate the antiulcer effects of mirtazapine and to determine its relationship with antioxidant mechanisms. The antiulcer activities of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg mirtazapine have been investigated on indomethacin-induced ulcers in rats, and the results have been compared with that of the control group. Mirtazapine decreased the indomethacin-induced ulcers significantly at all doses used. Mirtazapine significantly increased the glutathione (GSH) level, which decreased in the control group given only indomethacin. All doses of mirtazapine significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) level in stomach tissue compared to the control. Additionally, all doses of mirtazapine reversed the decrease in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in the stomach tissue of control rats. And finally, all doses of mirtazapine decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels significantly compared to the control. In conclusion, the activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms and the inhibition of some toxic oxidant mechanisms play a role in the antiulcer effect mechanism of mirtazapine. This new indication of mirtazapine will make it the first-choice drug in depressive patients with gastric ulcers."

Each of these repetitive units is folded into a triple-stranded structure that is highly helical. Peptide maps, antibody crossreactivity, peptide sequence analysis, and more recently nucleic acid sequences have defined several major properties of the erythroid molecule and related proteins in other tissues.

Necitumumab is a second-generation anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) similar to cetuximab. Enrollment has been stopped in one of two necitumumab phase III trials because of safety concerns. Ramucirumab is an anti-VEGFR2 mAb targeting the same pathway as bevacizumab. Although the phase II safety data for ramucirumab appear better than the data for necitumumab, fewer phase III data are available. Tivantinib is a highly selective, orally available MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor. MET is overexpressed in 61% of NSCLC cases. Although tivantinib is the last of the three agents discussed here to enter phase III, its phase II results are the most robust."

An 'aggregation-prone' pentapeptide ((47)LQVVR(51)) was located within the HCC sequence using AmylPred, an 'aggregation-prone' peptide prediction algorithm developed in our lab. This peptide was synthesized and self-assembled into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies reveal.

Many broad spectrum CDK inhibitors failed to inhibit Pfmrk suggesting that the active site differs from other CDKs in important ways. By screening compounds in the Walter Reed chemical database, we identified oxindole-based compounds as effective inhibitors of Pfmrk (IC(50) = 1.5 microM).

Many recent studies have shown that DOX toxicity involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although protection or alleviation of DOX toxicity can be achieved by administration of antioxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, their cardioprotective effect remains controversial. Thus alternative naturally occurring antioxidants may potentially be candidates for antioxidant therapy. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative and cytoprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria (PU) against DOX toxicity using H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. The total antioxidant capacity of PU (1 mg/ml) was 5306.75+/-461.62 FRAP value (microM). DOX IC50 values were used to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of PU ethanolic extract (1 or 10 microg/ml) in comparison with those of ascorbic acid (VIT C, 100 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 microM). PU treatments (1 or 10 microg/ml) dose dependently caused rightward DOX IC50 shifts of 2.8- and 8.5-fold, respectively while treatments with VIT C and NAC increased DOX IC50 by 3.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity were parameters used to evaluate cytoprotective effect. All antioxidants completely inhibited cellular lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activation induced by DOX (1 microM). Endogenous antioxidant defense such as total glutathione (tGSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was also modulated by the antioxidants. PU treatment alone dose dependently increased tGSH, and this effect was retained in the presence of DOX. Similar effect was observed in the assessment of catalase and SOD enzyme activity. The nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) transcription factor assay demonstrated that all antioxidants significantly inhibited DOX-induced NFkappaB activation. Our results suggest that PU protection against DOX cardiotoxicity was mediated through multiple pathways and this plant may serve as an alternative source of antioxidants for prevention of DOX cardiotoxicity."

Deamination of adenine by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) leads to the conversion of adenine into inosine (A-I editing) recognized by the splicing and translation systems as guanine. This may modify splicing sites in pre-mRNA and codons in translated regions ofmRNA and also affect the RNA secondary structure. Apart from mRNA, editing also involves microRNAs whose regulatory functions in multicellular animals are associated with the inhibition of transcription of target genes or with the degradation of certain RNA transcripts. ADARs can inhibit the production of mature microRNAs or modify microRNAs so that their specificity to target genes is altered. Adenosine deaminases editing adenines in transport RNAs (ADATs) convert adenine into inosine in tRNAs of all eukaryotes; as a result, the diversity of tRNA forms in the cell increases."

The process of store-operated Ca(2+) influx is essential for short-term as well as long-term responses by immune-system cells. Short-term responses include mast cell degranulation and killing of target cells by effector cytolytic T cells, whereas long-term responses typically involve changes in gene transcription and include T and B cell proliferation and differentiation. Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. The importance of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway for lymphocyte activation is underscored by the finding that the underlying defect in a family with a hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome is a defect in CRAC channel function, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, NFAT activation and transcription of cytokines, chemokines and many other NFAT target genes whose transcription is essential for productive immune defence. We recently used a two-pronged genetic approach to identify Orai1 as the pore subunit of the CRAC channel. On the one hand, we initiated a positional cloning approach in which we utilised genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping to identify the genomic region linked to the mutant gene in the SCID family described above. In parallel, we used a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify critical regulators of NFAT nuclear translocation and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. These approaches, together with subsequent mutational and electrophysiological analyses, converged to identify human Orai1 as a pore subunit of the CRAC channel and as the gene product mutated in the SCID patients."

                    "context": "There may be a relationship between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and iron absorption. PPIs may decrease the amount of iron absorbed gastrointestinally specifically due to alteration of the pH in the duodenum. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that includes an urge to move legs, accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, the urge to move is partially or totally relieved by movement, and the urge is worse or only occurs at night. In the majority of the restless leg syndrome population, the sensation is deep seated, often described as being in the shin bones, and most commonly felt between the knee and ankle. It may be described as a creepy, shock-like, tense, electric, buzzing, itchy, or even numb sensation. A subpopulation of this restless leg syndrome patient population experiences restless leg syndrome associated pain (RLSAP) that has been described as a deep \"achy pain.\" This pain has not been found to be relieved by many of the typical over the counter analgesics. Often, constant movement of the legs appears to be the only remedy, as these sensations usually appear during periods of rest. Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). The authors theorize that there may be a possible correlation between PPIs and the symptoms (e.g. pain) associated with RLS. The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). While there is no robust direct evidence to support any associations of PPIs and iron deficiency or PPIs associated with RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP), it is hoped that this manuscript may spark research efforts on this issue."

Because these polymorphisms influence warfarin dose requirements, they may primarily help determine therapeutic warfarin doses in patients who newly start on the drug. To assist in estimating therapeutic warfarin doses, the warfarin label provides a pharmacogenomic dosing table and various warfarin pharmacogenomic dosing algorithms are available. On the other hand, polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene affect clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. These polymorphisms may be useful to identify clopidogrel nonresponders who may benefit from taking an alternative antiplatelet agent such as prasugrel and ticagrelor. Although both drugs have pharmacogenomic tests available for clinical use, their clinical utilities have not been established and are currently being actively studied. In this review, clinical application of warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenomics will be focused. With the current level of evidence, potential patients who may get benefit from warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenomic testing will be discussed.

Although TREX2 is thought to bind NPC protein Nup1, defining the precise role of this interaction has been frustrated by the complex pleiotropic phenotype exhibited by nup1\u0394 strains. To provide a structural framework for understanding the binding of TREX2 to NPCs and its function in the gene expression pathway, we have determined the structure of the Nup1:TREX2 interaction interface and used this information to engineer a Sac3 variant that impairs NPC binding while not compromising TREX2 assembly. This variant inhibited the NPC association of both de-repressed and activated GAL1 and also produced mRNA export and growth defects. These results indicate that the TREX2:Nup1 interaction facilitates the efficient nuclear export of bulk mRNA together with the re-positioning of GAL1 to NPCs that is required for transcriptional control that is mediated by removal of SUMO from repressors by NPC-bound Ulp1.

In the past few years, however, several dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, including nicardipine, isradipine, felodipine, nimodipine, and amlodipine, have been marketed. Others are currently awaiting FDA approval. In addition, bepridil, which belongs to a new class of calcium channel antagonists, has recently been marketed for refractory angina pectoris. Clinical uses of calcium channel antagonists have been expanded since the 1970s to include management of cardiovascular disorders such as supraventricular arrhythmias, CHF secondary to diastolic dysfunction, and myocardial reinfarction in selected patients. Calcium channel antagonists are also being investigated for prevention of atherosclerosis. Calcium channel antagonists are a heterogeneous group of pharmacologic agents. Differences in tissue selectivity are largely responsible for the variations in hemodynamic and electrophysiologic properties of these agents. Thus, their clinical uses and side effect profiles differ. These differences must be taken into consideration in the selection of the most appropriate agent for a specific indication. Potential advantages of some of the newer dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists include less frequent dosing (amlodipine and isradipine) and little or no negative inotropic effect (nicardipine, felodipine, amlodipine, isradipine) compared with the prototype calcium channel antagonists. Additional clinical experience with these newer agents is required, however, before their role in the management of cardiovascular disorders can be fully delineated. The availability of sustained-release formulations of verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, felodipine, and nicardipine, as well as the recent marketing of calcium channel antagonists with relatively long half-lives (amlodipine and isradipine), makes once- or twice-daily dosing possible with most calcium channel blockers. However, selection of a particular agent will depend on several factors, including clinical efficacy, side effect profile, cost, and patient characteristics such as concomitant disease states and baseline hemodynamic status."

Chem. 274, 25136-25143), it has been shown that fU correctly paired with A is recognized by AlkA protein (Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II). In the present work, mispairing frequency of fU with G and cellular repair protein that specifically recognized fU:G mispairs were studied using defined oligonucleotide substrates. Mispairing frequency of fU was determined by incorporation of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate of fU opposite template G using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment deficient in 3'-5' exonuclease. Mispairing frequency of fU was dependent on the nearest neighbor base pair in the primer terminus and 2-12 times higher than that of thymine at pH 7.8 and 2.6-6.7 times higher at pH 9.0 with an exception of the nearest neighbor T(template):A(primer). AlkA catalyzed the excision of fU placed opposite G, as well as A, and the excision efficiencies of fU for fU:G and fU:A pairs were comparable. In addition, MutS protein involved in methyl-directed mismatch repair also recognized fU:G mispairs and bound them with an efficiency comparable to T:G mispairs, but it did not recognize fU:A pairs. Prior complex formation between MutS and a heteroduplex containing an fU:G mispair inhibited the activity of AlkA to fU. These results suggest that fU present in DNA can be restored by two independent repair pathways, i.e. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS. Biological relevance of the present results is discussed in light of DNA replication and repair in cells."

Existing methodologies typically require a combination of isotope-labeled spike-in references, cell counting, and protein concentration measurements. Here we present a novel method that delivers similar quantitative results directly from deep eukaryotic proteome datasets without any additional experimental steps. We show that the MS signal of histones can be used as a \"proteomic ruler\" because it is proportional to the amount of DNA in the sample, which in turn depends on the number of cells. As a result, our proteomic ruler approach adds an absolute scale to the MS readout and allows estimation of the copy numbers of individual proteins per cell. We compare our protein quantifications with values derived via the use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and protein epitope signature tags in a method that combines spike-in protein fragment standards with precise isotope label quantification. The proteomic ruler approach yields quantitative readouts that are in remarkably good agreement with results from the precision method. We attribute this surprising result to the fact that the proteomic ruler approach omits error-prone steps such as cell counting or protein concentration measurements. The proteomic ruler approach is readily applicable to any deep eukaryotic proteome dataset-even in retrospective analysis-and we demonstrate its usefulness with a series of mouse organ proteomes. "

Many tumor membrane targets are simultaneously targeted by humoral immunity, thus forming recognizable immunoglobulin responses. We sought to use this immune response to identify novel membrane-associated targets for CLL. Using a novel strategy, we interrogated CLL membrane-specific autologous immunoglobulin G reactivity. Our analysis unveiled lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1), a lymphocyte-specific target that is highly expressed in CLL. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by crosslinking F-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for critical signaling pathways. Small interfering RNA knockdown of LCP1 blocked migration toward CXCL12 in transwell assays and to bone marrow in an in vivo xenotransplant model, confirming a role for LCP1 in leukemia migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1. Our data demonstrate a novel strategy to identify cancer membrane target antigens using humoral anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we identify LCP1 as a membrane-associated target in CLL with confirmed pathogenic significance.

Sequencing by Edman degradation revealed a 21-residue peptide (GCRFCCNCCPNMSGCGVCCRF) with eight putative cysteines. Molecular mass measurements of the native peptide and the reduced and alkylated peptide confirmed the sequence with four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Peptide sequence homology to human hepcidin and other predicted hepcidins, indicated that the peptide is a new member of the hepcidin family. Nucleotide sequences for cDNA and genomic DNA were determined for white bass.

The gene has two introns and three exons. A TATA box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors including C/EBP, nuclear factor-kappaB, and hepatocyte nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site.

We reconstituted the mitochondrial targeting and insertion of TSPO into the OMM to analyze the signals and mechanisms required for this process. Initial studies indicated the formation of a mitochondrial 66 kDa complex through Blue Native-PAGE analysis. The formation of this complex was found to be dependent on the presence of ATP and the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90. Through mutational analysis we identified two areas necessary for TSPO targeting, import, and function: amino acids 103-108 (Schellman motif), which provide the necessary structural orientation for import, and the cholesterol-binding C-terminus required for insertion. Although the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex proteins Tom22 and Tom40 were present in the OMM, the TOM complex did not interact with TSPO. In search of proteins involved in TSPO import, we analyzed complexes known to interact with TSPO by mass spectrometry. Formation of the 66 kDa complex was found to be dependent on an identified protein, Metaxin 1, for formation and TSPO import. The level of import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria was increased following treatment of the cells with cAMP. These findings suggest that the initial targeting of TSPO to mitochondria is dependent upon the presence of cytosolic chaperones interacting with the import receptor Tom70. The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif. Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1. Import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria is regulated by cAMP."

Twenty-nine patients with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for CCSVI, outside a clinical relapse. All the patients were regularly observed over at least two years before the first endovascular treatment and for at least two years after it (mean post-procedure follow up 30.6\u00b16.1 months). The following clinical outcome measures were used: annual relapse rate and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. All the patients were observed intensively (mean 6 hours) on the day of the endovascular treatment to monitor for possible complications (bleeding, shock, heart attack, death). We compared the annual relapse rate before and after treatment (in the two years before and the two years after the first endovascular treatment) and the EDSS score recorded two years before versus two years after the treatment. Overall, 44 endovascular procedures were performed in the 29 patients, without complications. Thirteen of the 29 patients (45%) underwent more than one treatment session because of venous re-stenosis: 11 and two patients underwent two and three endovascular treatments respectively. The annual relapse rate of MS was significantly lower post-procedure (0.45\u00b10.62 vs 0.76\u00b10.99; p=0.021), although it increased in four patients. The EDSS score two years after treatment was significantly lower compared to the EDSS score recorded at the examination two years before treatment (1.98\u00b10.92 vs 2.27\u00b10.93; p=0.037), although it was higher in four patients. Endovascular treatment of concurrent CCSVI seems to be safe and repeatable and may reduce annual relapse rates and cumulative disability in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Randomized controlled studies are needed to further assess the clinical effects of endovascular treatment of CCSVI in MS."

Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function and morphology and to look for mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients presented with EVA. Among 57 consecutive patients with sensorineural deafness 15 with EVA, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were identified and studied. A complete evaluation of thyroid function including thyroid echography and perchlorate discharge test was carried out in all patients with EVA; all exons of the SLC26A4 gene were amplified from peripheral leukocytes and directly sequenced, using specific intronic primers. Out of 15 patients with EVA, goiter was present in 8 (53%), hypothyroidism in 7 (47%), increased serum thyroglobulin levels in 8 (53%) and a positive perchlorate discharge test in 10 (67%). Nine alleles of the SLC26A4 gene were mutated: 2 novel mutations (L465W and G497R) and 4 already known mutations (T410M, R409H, T505N and IVS1001+1G>A) were found. Four subjects were compound heterozygous and 1 heterozygous (G497R/wt). All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid. The remaining 10 patients had no mutations in the SLC26A4 gene: 4 of them were hypothyroid, 2 with goiter and positive perchlorate discharge test, 2 without goiter and with negative perchlorate discharge test. Two patients without mutations were euthyroid with positive perchlorate discharge test. Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations. The results of the present study lend support to the concept that all patients with mutated SLC26A4 gene have abnormalities of thyroid function tests."

In the present study assessment was performed of the diagnostic importance of the ventricular derepolarization parameters, clinical features, and prevalence of JLNS among 132 children with congenital hearing loss (CHL). In the CHL group the mean QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals and the dispersion values (QT-d, JT-d, QTc-d, and JTc-d) were significantly longer than those of control subjects (n = 96) (P < 0.05). Patients with CHL and JLNS (n = 5) had significantly longer mean values of QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals and dispersion values than those of CHL without JLNS (n = 127) and control subjects (P < 0.05). The results suggest that assessment of ventricular derepolarization parameters in children with CHL will be helpful in the early detection of JLNS because infants with CHL cannot accurately describe the symptoms of syncope."

Here we analyze genome-wide occupancy patterns of CTCF by ChIP-seq in 19 diverse human cell types, including normal primary cells and immortal lines. We observed highly reproducible yet surprisingly plastic genomic binding landscapes, indicative of strong cell-selective regulation of CTCF occupancy. Comparison with massively parallel bisulfite sequencing data indicates that 41% of variable CTCF binding is linked to differential DNA methylation, concentrated at two critical positions within the CTCF recognition sequence. Unexpectedly, CTCF binding patterns were markedly different in normal versus immortal cells, with the latter showing widespread disruption of CTCF binding associated with increased methylation. Strikingly, this disruption is accompanied by up-regulation of CTCF expression, with the result that both normal and immortal cells maintain the same average number of CTCF occupancy sites genome-wide. These results reveal a tight linkage between DNA methylation and the global occupancy patterns of a major sequence-specific regulatory factor."

High-affinity binding of the plant homeodomain (PHD) of TFIID subunit TAF3 to trimethylated lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) is involved in promoter recruitment of this basal transcription factor. Here, we show that for transcription activation the PHD of TAF3 can be replaced by PHDs of other high-affinity H3K4me3 binders. Interestingly, H3K4me3 binding of TFIID and the TAF3-PHD is decreased by phosphorylation of the adjacent threonine residue (H3T3), which coincides with mitotic inhibition of transcription. Ectopic expression of the H3T3 kinase haspin repressed TAF3-mediated transcription of endogenous and of reporter genes and decreased TFIID association with chromatin. Conversely, immunofluorescence and live-cell microscopy studies showed an increased association of TFIID with mitotic chromosomes upon haspin knockdown. Based on our observations, we propose that a histone H3 phospho-methyl switch regulates TFIID-mediated transcription during mitotic progression of the cell cycle."

During beta-cell regeneration these histone modifications are reversed resulting in reduced p16(INK4a) expression and increased proliferation.

We identified, by differential display technique, the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4 mRNA down regulation in frataxin overexpressing cells. We studied the stress kinases pathway in this cellular model and in fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Frataxin overexpression reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, exposure of FRDA fibroblasts to several forms of environmental stress caused an up regulation of phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun. To understand if this susceptibility results in cell death, we have investigated the involvement of caspases. A significantly higher activation of caspase-9 was observed in FRDA versus control fibroblasts after serum-withdrawal. Our findings suggest the presence, in FRDA patient cells, of a 'hyperactive' stress signaling pathway. The role of frataxin in FRDA pathogenesis could be explained, at least in part, by this hyperactivity."

Here we review recent findings that disruptions of CNEs, within or at long distance from the coding sequences of key genes involved in NCC development, result in neurocristopathies via the alteration of tissue- or stage-specific long-distance regulation of gene expression. While most studies on human genetic disorders have focused on protein-coding sequences, these examples suggest that investigation of genomic alterations of CNEs will provide a broader understanding of the molecular etiology of both rare and common human congenital malformations."

To date such studies have focused almost exclusively on protein-coding transcripts. However, recent transcriptome analyses show that the mammalian genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which appear to be expressed in a developmentally regulated manner. The functions of these remain untested. To identify ncRNAs involved in ES cell biology, we used a custom-designed microarray to examine the expression profiles of mouse ES cells differentiating as embryoid bodies (EBs) over a 16-d time course. We identified 945 ncRNAs expressed during EB differentiation, of which 174 were differentially expressed, many correlating with pluripotency or specific differentiation events. Candidate ncRNAs were identified for further characterization by an integrated examination of expression profiles, genomic context, chromatin state, and promoter analysis. Many ncRNAs showed coordinated expression with genomically associated developmental genes, such as Dlx1, Dlx4, Gata6, and Ecsit. We examined two novel developmentally regulated ncRNAs, Evx1as and Hoxb5/6as, which are derived from homeotic loci and share similar expression patterns and localization in mouse embryos with their associated protein-coding genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence that both ncRNAs are associated with trimethylated H3K4 histones and histone methyltransferase MLL1, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation of homeotic loci during ES cell differentiation. Taken together, our data indicate that long ncRNAs are likely to be important in processes directing pluripotency and alternative differentiation programs, in some cases through engagement of the epigenetic machinery."

Although SOD1 mutant mice show phenotypes similar to FALS, dissimilar drug responses and size differences limit their usefulness to study the disease mechanism(s) and identify potential therapeutic compounds. Development of an in vitro model system for ALS is expected to help in obtaining novel insights into disease mechanisms and discovery of therapeutics. We report the establishment of an in vitro FALS model from human embryonic stem cells overexpressing either a wild-type (WT) or a mutant SOD1 (G93A) gene and the evaluation of the phenotypes and survival of the spinal motor neurons (sMNs), which are the neurons affected in ALS patients. The in vitro FALS model that we developed mimics the in vivo human ALS disease in terms of the following: (a) selective degeneration of sMNs expressing the G93A SOD1 but not those expressing the WT gene; (b) susceptibility of G93A SOD1-derived sMNs to form ubiquitinated inclusions; (c) astrocyte-derived factor(s) in the selective degeneration of G93A SOD1 sMNs; and (d) cell-autonomous, as well as non-cell-autonomous, dependent sMN degeneration.

The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity.

Particularly, the sustained activation of diverse developmental cascades such as hedgehog, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/TGF-\u03b2R receptors and/or stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) can play critical functions for high self-renewal potential, survival, invasion and metastases of cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies. It has also been observed that cancer cells may be reprogrammed to re-express different pluripotency-associated stem cell-like markers such as Myc, Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2 along the EMT process and under stressful and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the enhanced expression and/or activities of some drug resistance-associated molecules such as Bcl-2, Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters frequently occur in cancer cells during cancer progression and metastases. These molecular events may cooperate for the survival and acquisition of a more aggressive and migratory behavior by cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during cancer transition to metastatic and recurrent disease states. Of therapeutic interest, these altered gene products may also be exploited as molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets to develop novel multitargeted strategies for improving current cancer therapies and preventing disease relapse.

The leading compound in this class of therapeutic, PBT2, improved cognition in a clinical trial with AD patients. The aim of the present study was to examine the cellular mechanism of action for PBT2. We show PBT2 induces inhibitory phosphorylation of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-isoforms of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and that this activity is dependent on PBT2 translocating extracellular Zn and Cu into cells. This activity is supported when A\u03b2:Zn aggregates are the source of extracellular Zn and adding PBT2 to A\u03b2:Zn preparations promotes A\u03b2 degradation by matrix metalloprotease 2. PBT2-induced glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation appears to involve inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin. Consistent with this, PBT2 increased phosphorylation of other calcineurin substrates, including cAMP response element binding protein and Ca\u00b2\u207a/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. These data demonstrate PBT2 can decrease A\u03b2 levels by sequestering the Zn that promotes extracellular formation of protease resistant A\u03b2:Zn aggregates, and that subsequent intracellular translocation of the Zn by PBT2 induces cellular responses with synapto-trophic potential. Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD."

                    "context": "The acromelic dysplasia group is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, stiff joint, and \"muscular\" build. Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), geleophysic dysplasia (GD), acromicric dysplasia (AD), and Myhre syndrome (MS). Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern inheritance. WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of microspherophakia and has autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. GD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, tracheal stenosis, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early death. AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and skeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). Finally, MS is sporadic, characterized by prognathism, deafness, developmental delay, thickened calvarium, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. We first identified mutations in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the dominant form of WMS and then mutations in A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 (ADAMTS10) in the recessive form of WMS. The function of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between ADAMTS10 and FBN1. We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the recessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of GD and in AD (exon 41-42, encoding TGF\u03b2 binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1). The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we identified latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) binding protein 1 as a partner of ADAMTSL2. We found an increased level of active TGF\u03b2 in the fibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced phosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGF\u03b2 signaling in GD and AD. Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship as the underlying mechanism of the short stature phenotypes. Using exome sequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, all involving isoleucine residue at position 500, in the MH2 domain. In MS fibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased level of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein. Functional SMAD4 is required for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. We therefore studied the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus. We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGF\u03b2 target genes supporting impaired TGF\u03b2 driven transcriptional control in MS. Our findings support a direct link between the short stature phenotypes and the TGF\u03b2 signaling. However, the finding of enhanced TGF\u03b2 signaling in Marfan phenotypes supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGF\u03b2 action."

At least two kallikreins, KLK6 and KLK10, are significantly up-regulated in pancreatic cancer. We probed 2 normal and 6 pancreatic cancer SAGE libraries with gene-specific tags for each of these kallikreins. KLK6 was found to be expressed in 5/6 cancer libraries and showed the most marked (5-fold) increase in average expression levels in cancer vs. normal. These data were verified by screening the EST databases, where all mRNA clones isolated were from cancerous libraries, with no clones detected in normal pancreatic tissues or cell lines. X-profiler comparison of two pools of normal and cancerous pancreatic libraries further verified the significant increase of KLK6 expression levels in pancreatic cancer. DDD data showed a 13-fold increase in KLK10 expression in pancreatic cancer. Three kallikrein genes, KLK6, 8 and 10 are overexpressed in colon cancer compared to normal colon, while one kallikrein, KLK1, is down-regulated. While no expression of KLK6 was detected in normal colon, KLK6-specific tags were detectable in 2 cancer libraries. Similar results were obtained by EST screening; no KLK6 clones were detected in any of the 28 normal libraries examined, while 10 KLK6 EST clones were found in colon adenocarcinoma. KLK10 was not detectable in normal colon. Gene-specific tags were, however, detectable with high density in colon cancer and 7 EST clones were found to be expressed in colon Adenocarcinoma."

Starting at 4-5 mo of age, OVE26 mice were treated with GKT137831 at 10 or 40 mg/kg, once-a-day for 4 wk. At both doses, GKT137831 inhibited NADPH oxidase activity, superoxide generation, and hydrogen peroxide production in the renal cortex from diabetic mice without affecting Nox1 or Nox4 protein expression. The increased expression of fibronectin and type IV collagen was reduced in the renal cortex, including glomeruli, of diabetic mice treated with GKT137831. GKT137831 significantly reduced glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial matrix expansion, urinary albumin excretion, and podocyte loss in OVE26 mice. GKT137831 also attenuated macrophage infiltration in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium.

Thus, there is a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1\u03b2 activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1\u03b2 has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1\u03b2 signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1\u03b2 signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple components, it is important to understand the kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on this process. In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1\u03b2 system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1\u03b2 for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the binding of IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1RI and the subsequent recruitment of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of these interactions. Based on this information and recently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for binding of IL-1\u03b2 to its receptor by altering the electrostatic surface potential of IL-1\u03b2, thus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1\u03b2 signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1\u03b2-associated autoinflammatory diseases.

The cDNA encodes the precursor form of H-protein that is comprised of 39 amino acid residues for a mitochondrial presequence and 125 amino acid residues for the mature protein, following a 5' untranslated region of 13 base pairs. There are two genuine consensus sequences for the cleavage/polyadenylation of the precursor H-protein mRNA in the 3' untranslated region of the cDNA sequence. We showed by comparison with the delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene that only one copy of the H-protein cDNA occurs in the haploid genome of the chicken. Nevertheless, two types of H-protein mRNAs, which differ by the length of their 3' untranslated region, are produced in liver. The chicken H-protein gene extends over 8 kilobase pairs on the genome and includes 5 exons that encode the entire cDNA sequence.

The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers and binding to some transcription factors. The WD domain folds to form a beta-propeller, which mediates protein-protein interactions. Many transcription factors interact with the WD domain via a short peptide motif that falls into either of two classes: WRPW and related tetrapeptides; and the 'eh1' motif (FxIxxIL). Gro family proteins are broadly expressed during development and in the adult. They have essential functions in many developmental pathways (including Notch and Wnt signaling) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of some cancers. The molecular mechanisms through which Gro proteins act to repress transcription are not yet well understood. It is becoming clear that Gro proteins have different modes of action in vivo dependent on biological context and these include direct and indirect modification of chromatin structure at target genes."

GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'\u2192P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase. The aim of this study was to define the effects of long-term GRN163L exposure on the maintenance of telomeres and lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells. Telomere size, telomerase activity, and telomerase inhibition response to GRN163L were measured in a panel of 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The cell lines exhibited large differences in levels of telomerase activity (46-fold variation), but most lines had very short telomeres (2-3 kb in size). GRN163L inhibited telomerase in all 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines, with IC50 ranging from 50 nM to 200 nM. Continuous GRN163L exposure of CAPAN1 (IC50\u200a=\u200a75 nM) and CD18 cells (IC50\u200a=\u200a204 nM) resulted in an initial rapid shortening of the telomeres followed by the maintenance of extremely short but stable telomeres. Continuous exposure to the drug eventually led to crisis and to a complete loss of viability after 47 (CAPAN1) and 69 (CD18) doublings. Crisis In these cells was accompanied by activation of a DNA damage response (\u03b3-H2AX) and evidence of both senescence (SA-\u03b2-galactosidase activity) and apoptosis (sub-G1 DNA content, PARP cleavage). Removal of the drug after long-term GRN163L exposure led to a reactivation of telomerase and re-elongation of telomeres in the third week of cultivation without GRN163L. These findings show that the lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells can be limited by continuous telomerase inhibition. These results should facilitate the design of future clinical trials of GRN163L in patients with pancreatic cancer. "

In this paper, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, we present evidence that Alu and B1 elements have been selectively retained in the upstream and intronic regions of genes belonging to specific functional classes. At the same time, we found no evidence for selective loss of these elements in any functional class. A subset of the functional links we discovered corresponds to functions where Alu involvement has actually been experimentally validated, whereas the majority of the functional links we report are novel. Finally, the unexpected finding that Alu and B1 elements show similar biases in their distribution across functional classes, despite having spread independently in their respective genomes, further supports our claim that the extant instances of Alu and B1 elements are the result of positive selection."

We have previously argued that unrepaired G:T mismatches from spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites could be converted to apparent in vivo mutations in the bacterial recovery systems because of rapid, random, mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have measured mutation frequencies in spleen of male mice induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) using the PhiX174 transgene, which is not subject to mismatch repair in E.coli, using single-burst analysis, a unique method to identify in vivo mutation. In order to compare our results to those using the lacI and cII transgenes, we converted all mutant frequencies to base pair substitution (bps) mutation frequencies per nucleotide based on mutant spectra from this study and published literature. We found this frequency in control spleen to be similar for lacI (3.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-8)) and PhiX174 (3.1 +/- 1.2 x 10(-8)) at 6 weeks of age. We found a strong age dependence for spontaneous lacI mutation that extrapolated to a value at conception (1.8 +/- 0.9 x 10(-8)) that was not significantly different from the human germ line bps mutation frequency per nucleotide of 1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8). These two transgenes provided similar mutational responses to 40 mg/kg ENU, 7- to 9-fold. In contrast, the cII target gene in the same tissue produces both spontaneous and induced mutation frequencies approximately 10 times higher, for unknown reasons. We conclude that the spontaneous mutant frequencies measured by the lacI and PhiX174 transgenes in this moderately dividing tissue accurately measure in vivo mutation frequencies at early ages. For these two transgenes, seemingly high mutant frequencies may reflect the expected accumulation of somatic mutation with age."

PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), containing \u03b1-synuclein, a small protein which is widely expressed in the brain. The \u03b1-synuclein gene, SNCA, is located on chromosome 4q22.1; SNCA-linked PD shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a relatively early onset age, and it usually progresses rapidly. Three missense mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in addition to gene multiplications of the SNCA have been described so far. Although it is clear that LBs and LNs contain mainly the \u03b1-synuclein protein, the mechanism(s) which leads \u03b1-synuclein to accumulate needs to be elucidated. The primary question in the molecular pathology of PD is how wild-type \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in PD, and which interacting partner(s) plays role(s) in the aggregation process. It is known that dopamine synthesis is a stressfull event, and \u03b1-synuclein expression somehow affects the dopamine synthesis. The aberrant interactions of \u03b1-synuclein with the proteins in the dopamine synthesis pathway may cause disturbances in cellular mechanisms. The normal physiological folding state of \u03b1-synuclein is also important for the understanding of pathological aggregates. Recent studies on the \u03b1-synuclein protein and genome-wide association studies of the \u03b1-synuclein gene show that PD has a strong genetic component, and both familial and idiopathic PD have a common denominator, \u03b1-synuclein, at the molecular level. It is clear that the disease process in Parkinson's disease, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, is very complicated; there can be several different molecular pathways which are responsible for diverse and possibly also unrelated functions inside the neuron, playing roles in PD pathogenesis."

In our review, we explore this comparison emphasizing overlaps and disconnects, summarize recent literature exploring the relationship between the 2 entities, and make suggestions for future research. There is considerable overlap in the diagnostic criteria for childhood RLS and growing pains. The literature also indicates that RLS and growing pains more commonly occur together than one would expect based on chance alone, and the family histories of RLS and growing pains often are overlapping. Leg rubbing to obtain relief from leg discomfort is common to both disorders, though walking to obtain relief seems unique to RLS. Childhood RLS also has been reported to be painful in up to 45% of cases. The development of standard diagnostic criteria is necessary to move forward in the field of growing pains research. A quantitative and validated rating scale for growing pains severity already exists. Because of the clinical and genetic similarity between RLS and growing pains, studies that parallel those previously performed in RLS patients are recommended for growing pains patients. For example, a genome wide association study in growing pains patients of all possible genes with particular attention to those identified as related to RLS and a therapeutic trial of medications known to be effective in RLS would be welcome. Abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism also may be common to both disorders. "

Residing in the cytosol as dimers and tetramers, Drp1 is recruited by receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it further assembles into a helical ring that drives division via GTP-dependent constriction. The Drp1 receptor Mff is a major regulator of mitochondrial fission, and its overexpression results in increased fission. In contrast, the alternative Drp1 receptors MiD51 and MiD49 appear to recruit inactive forms of Drp1, because their overexpression inhibits fission. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we studied the interaction of Drp1 with Mff. We show that the insert B region of Drp1 inhibits Mff-Drp1 interactions, such that recombinant Drp1 mutants lacking insert B form a stable complex with Mff. Mff cannot bind to assembly-deficient mutants of Drp1, suggesting that Mff selectively interacts with higher-order complexes of Drp1. In contrast, the alternative Drp1 receptors MiD51 and MiD49 can recruit Drp1 dimers. Therefore Drp1 recruitment by Mff versus MiD51 and MiD49 may result in different outcomes because they recruit different subpopulations of Drp1 from the cytosol. "

This article describes the development and validation of a bioanalytical assay for niraparib and its carboxylic acid metabolite M1 in human plasma and urine using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sample pre-treatment involved protein precipitation for plasma and dilution of urine samples using acetonitrile-methanol (50:50, v/v). Final extracts were injected onto a SunFire C18 column and gradient elution using 20mM ammonium acetate (mobile phase A) and formic acid:acetonitrile:methanol (0.1:50:50, v/v/v) (mobile phase B) was applied. Detection was performed on an API5500 tandem mass spectrometer operating in the positive electrospray ionisation mode applying multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The assay was successfully validated in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration and latest European Medicines Agency guidelines on bioanalytical method validation and can therefore be applied in pharmacological clinical studies."

Diagnosis of both, acute myocardial infarction and beta-thalassaemia trait, was based on the standard clinical and laboratory criteria. We found that patients with acute myocardial infarction had low frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait (4.31%), as compared with the mean incidence of heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia in the whole Greek population (7.61%) (p < 0.02). This finding was more clear in the older age groups of the patients studied. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait between control subjects (8.49%) and the whole Greek population. We concluded that the heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia may protect the carrier from acute myocardial infarction. This effect is probably related to low serum cholesterol levels, slight anaemia, and microcytosis lowering the blood viscosity. These changes are usually present in the beta-thalassaemia trait carriers."

The anti-PD-L1 mAb avelumab is unique among checkpoint inhibitors in that it is a fully human IgG1 capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. Here, we investigated avelumab as a potential therapy for chordoma. We examined 4 chordoma cell lines, first for expression of PD-L1, and in vitro for ADCC killing using NK cells and avelumab. PD-L1 expression was markedly upregulated by IFN-\u03b3 in all 4 chordoma cell lines, which significantly increased sensitivity to ADCC. Brachyury is a transcription factor that is uniformly expressed in chordoma. Clinical trials are ongoing in which chordoma patients are treated with brachyury-specific vaccines. Co-incubating chordoma cells with brachyury-specific CD8+ T cells resulted in significant upregulation of PD-L1 on the tumor cells, mediated by the CD8+ T cells' IFN-\u03b3 production, and increased sensitivity of chordoma cells to avelumab-mediated ADCC. Residential cancer stem cell subpopulations of chordoma cells were also killed by avelumab-mediated ADCC to the same degree as non-cancer stem cell populations. These findings suggest that as a monotherapy for chordoma, avelumab may enable endogenous NK cells, while in combination with T-cell immunotherapy, such as a vaccine, avelumab may enhance NK-cell killing of chordoma cells via ADCC.

In a population of wild chimpanzees, we measured urinary oxytocin levels following a rare cooperative event--food sharing. Subjects showed higher urinary oxytocin levels after single food-sharing events compared with other types of social feeding, irrespective of previous social bond levels. Also, urinary oxytocin levels following food sharing were higher than following grooming, another cooperative behaviour. Therefore, food sharing in chimpanzees may play a key role in social bonding under the influence of oxytocin. We propose that food-sharing events co-opt neurobiological mechanisms evolved to support mother-infant bonding during lactation bouts, and may act as facilitators of bonding and cooperation between unrelated individuals via the oxytocinergic system across social mammals."

Including subsequent fine mapping on chromosome 5p, a total of 523 markers were genotyped. The highest nonparametric multipoint LOD score of 2.59 (empirical genome-wide significance 0.1) was obtained for chromosome 5p at 17 cM (according to the Marshfield map). Subsequent analyses revealed (a) a higher LOD score of 3.37 at 39 cM for a quantitative severity score based on symptoms of inattention than for hyperactivity/impulsivity (LOD score of 1.11 at 59 cM), and (b) an HLOD of 4.75 (empirical genome-wide significance 0.001) based on a parametric model assuming dominant inheritance. The locus of the solute carrier 6A3 (SLC6A3; dopamine transporter 1; DAT1) localizes to 5p15.33; the gene has repeatedly been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. However, in our sample the DAT1 VNTR did not show association with ADHD.

The classroom example of a visible evolutionary response is industrial melanism in the peppered moth (Biston betularia): the replacement, during the Industrial Revolution, of the common pale typica form by a previously unknown black (carbonaria) form, driven by the interaction between bird predation and coal pollution. The carbonaria locus has been coarsely localized to a 200-kilobase region, but the specific identity and nature of the sequence difference controlling the carbonaria-typica polymorphism, and the gene it influences, are unknown. Here we show that the mutation event giving rise to industrial melanism in Britain was the insertion of a large, tandemly repeated, transposable element into the first intron of the gene cortex. Statistical inference based on the distribution of recombined carbonaria haplotypes indicates that this transposition event occurred around 1819, consistent with the historical record. We have begun to dissect the mode of action of the carbonaria transposable element by showing that it increases the abundance of a cortex transcript, the protein product of which plays an important role in cell-cycle regulation, during early wing disc development. Our findings fill a substantial knowledge gap in the iconic example of microevolutionary change, adding a further layer of insight into the mechanism of adaptation in response to natural selection. The discovery that the mutation itself is a transposable element will stimulate further debate about the importance of 'jumping genes' as a source of major phenotypic novelty. "

However, cardio-specific expression of polyQ peptides caused pathological response in murine models, suggesting the presence of a nervous system-independent heart phenotype in HD patients. A positive correlation between the CAG repeat size and severity of symptoms observed in HD patients has also been observed in in vitro HD cellular models. Here, we test the suitability of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines carrying HD-specific mutation as in vitro models for understanding molecular mechanisms of cardiac pathology seen in HD patients. We have differentiated three HD-hESC lines into cardiomyocytes and investigated CAG stability up to 60 days after starting differentiation. To assess CAG stability in other tissues, the lines were also subjected to in vivo differentiation into teratomas for 10 weeks. Neither directed differentiation into cardiomyocytes in vitro nor in vivo differentiation into teratomas, rich in immature neuronal tissue, led to an increase in the number of CAG repeats. Although the CAG stability might be cell line-dependent, induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with larger numbers of CAG repeats could have an advantage as a research tool for understanding cardiac symptoms of HD patients.

Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of \u03b3-secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates A\u03b2. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to A\u03b2 deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in >\u00a040% of cases, has been found to impair A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of A\u03b242 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different A\u03b2 antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, A\u03b2 dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target."

Although both are rare, once wild poliovirus transmission has been interrupted by OPV, the only poliomyelitis due to poliovirus will be caused by OPV. Poliovirus will be eradicated only when OPV use is discontinued. This paradox provides a major incentive for eventually stopping polio immunization or replacing OPV, but it also introduces complexity into the process of identifying safe and scientifically sound strategies for doing so. The core post eradication immunization issues include the risk/benefits of continued OPV use, the extent of OPV replacement with IPV, possible strategies for discontinuing OPV, and the potential for development and licensure of a safe and effective replacement for OPV. Formulation of an informed post eradication immunization policy requires careful evaluation of polio epidemiology, surveillance capability, vaccine availability, laboratory containment, and the risks posed by the very tool responsible for successful interruption of wild poliovirus transmission."

Effective surface charge neutralization of bacteria was observed for HD5 as compared to the non-fatty acylated linear analogs. Our results show that HD5 and non-fatty acylated linear analogs enter the bacterial cytoplasm without causing damage to the bacterial inner membrane. Although fatty acylated peptides exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable to HD5, their mechanism of action involved permeabilization of the Escherichia coli inner membrane. HD5 and analogs had the ability to bind plasmid DNA. HD5 had greater binding affinity to plasmid DNA as compared to the analogs. The three dimensional structure of HD5 favors greater interaction with the bacterial cell surface and also with DNA. Antibacterial activity of HD5 involves entry into bacterial cytoplasm and binding to DNA which would result in shut down of the bacterial metabolism leading to cell death. We show how a moderately active linear peptide derived from the \u03b1-defensin HD5 can be engineered to enhance antimicrobial activity almost comparable to the native peptide. "

In this perspective, we used subgroups of specific ALS-linked gene mutations to go through existing animal models and to provide a comprehensive profile of the differences and similarities between animal models of disease and human disease. Finally, we reviewed application of biomarkers and gene therapies relevant in personalized medicine approach.

However, all neural crest cells express Sox10 and the mechanisms directing neural crest cells into a specific lineage are poorly understood.

In neural crest cells, HDAC1/2 induced expression of the transcription factor Pax3 by binding and activating the Pax3 promoter. In turn, Pax3 was required to maintain high Sox10 levels and to trigger expression of Fabp7. In addition, HDAC1/2 were bound to the P0 promoter and activated P0 transcription. Consistently, in vivo genetic deletion of HDAC1/2 in mouse neural crest cells led to strongly decreased Sox10 expression, no detectable Pax3, virtually no satellite glia, and no Schwann cell precursors in dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. Similarly, in vivo ablation of Pax3 in the mouse neural crest resulted in strongly reduced expression of Sox10 and Fabp7. Therefore, by controlling the expression of Pax3 and the concerted action of Pax3 and Sox10 on their target genes, HDAC1/2 direct the specification of neural crest cells into peripheral glia. "

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are key regulators of Ub signaling, but a dedicated DUB for Met1 linkages has not been identified. Here, we reveal a previously unannotated human DUB, OTULIN (also known as FAM105B), which is exquisitely specific for Met1 linkages. Crystal structures of the OTULIN catalytic domain in complex with diubiquitin reveal Met1-specific Ub-binding sites and a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in which the proximal Ub activates the catalytic triad of the protease. Mutation of Ub Glu16 inhibits OTULIN activity by reducing kcat 240-fold. OTULIN overexpression or knockdown affects NF-\u03baB responses to LUBAC, TNF\u03b1, and poly(I:C) and sensitizes cells to TNF\u03b1-induced cell death. We show that OTULIN binds LUBAC and that overexpression of OTULIN prevents TNF\u03b1-induced NEMO association with ubiquitinated RIPK1. Our data suggest that OTULIN regulates Met1-polyUb signaling."

A. muciniphila has been linked with intestinal health and improved metabolic status in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. Specifically, A. muciniphila has been shown to reduce high-fat-diet-induced endotoxemia, which develops as a result of an impaired gut barrier. Despite the accumulating evidence of the health-promoting effects of A. muciniphila, the mechanisms of interaction of the bacterium with the host have received little attention. In this study, we used several in vitro models to investigate the adhesion of A. muciniphila to the intestinal epithelium and its interaction with the host mucosa. We found that A. muciniphila adheres strongly to the Caco-2 and HT-29 human colonic cell lines but not to human colonic mucus. In addition, A. muciniphila showed binding to the extracellular matrix protein laminin but not to collagen I or IV, fibronectin, or fetuin. Importantly, A. muciniphila improved enterocyte monolayer integrity, as shown by a significant increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cocultures of Caco-2 cells with the bacterium. Further, A. muciniphila induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) production by enterocytes at cell concentrations 100-fold higher than those for Escherichia coli, suggesting a very low level of proinflammatory activity in the epithelium. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that A. muciniphila adheres to the intestinal epithelium and strengthens enterocyte monolayer integrity in vitro, suggesting an ability to fortify an impaired gut barrier. These results support earlier associative in vivo studies and provide insights into the interaction of A. muciniphila with the host. "

This upregulation was canceled by knockdown of NOXO1 with small interfering RNAs. TNF-alpha rapidly phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2, followed by phosphorylation of c-Jun and c-Fos and appearance of an AP-1 binding activity within 30 min. We cloned the 5' flank of the human NOXO1 gene (-3888 to +263 bp), and found that the region between -585 and -452 bp, which contains consensus elements of YY-1, AP-1, and Ets, and the GC-rich region encoding three putative binding sites for SP-1, was crucial for TNF-alpha-dependent promoter activity. Serial mutation analysis of the elements identified an AP-1 binding site (from -561 to -551 bp, agtAAGtcatg) as a crucial element for TNF-alpha-stimulated transcription of the human NOXO1 gene, which was also confirmed by the AP-1 decoy experiments. Thus, TNF-alpha acts as a potent activator of Nox1-based oxidase in colon epithelial cells, suggesting a potential role of this oxidase in inflammation of the colon."

In humans, haploinsufficiency of MITF causes Waardenburg syndrome type 2, while a dominant-negative mutation causes Tietz syndrome. Four isoforms have been cloned so far: MITF-M is the most abundant and is expressed in neural-crest-derived melanocytes; MITF-A is expressed in various cultured cells including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and enriched in RPE of embryonal and developing eyes; MITF-H are expressed in many types of cultured cells and in the heart tissue; MITF-C is expressed in many types of cultured cells, but not in melanocytes. Many growth factor signaling pathways have been implicated for regulation of MITF at both protein and promoter levels. Most notably, Steel factor/c-Kit signaling pathway was linked to phosphorylation of MITF at Ser73 and Ser409 through activation of MAP kinase and RSK-1, respectively. Phosphorylation of MITF is also conducted at Ser298 through GSK3beta, although the signaling pathway for this event still remains to be elucidated. IGF-1 and HGF/SF pathways may merge with the c-Kit signaling pathway. WNT and MSH signaling pathways regulate MITF positively at the promoter level. Endothelins may regulate MITF at the protein and promoter levels. MITF is involved in the differentiation, growth and survival of pigment cells, employing a number of signaling pathways."

Previously, research on snails was used to show that left-right signaling of Nodal, downstream of symmetry breaking, may be an ancestral feature of the Bilateria [1 and 2]. Here, we report that a disabling mutation in one copy of a tandemly duplicated, diaphanous-related formin is perfectly associated with symmetry breaking in the pond snail. This is supported by the observation that an anti-formin drug treatment converts dextral snail embryos to a sinistral phenocopy, and in frogs, drug inhibition or overexpression by microinjection of formin has a chirality-randomizing effect in early (pre-cilia) embryos. Contrary to expectations based on existing models [3, 4 and 5], we discovered asymmetric gene expression in 2- and 4-cell snail embryos, preceding morphological asymmetry. As the formin-actin filament has been shown to be part of an asymmetry-breaking switch in vitro [6 and 7], together these results are consistent with the view that animals with diverse body plans may derive their asymmetries from the same intracellular chiral elements [8]."

We performed a 3-month general toxicology study, a preliminary pharmacokinetic study using drug-loaded vaginal gel, and a detailed assessment of the kinetics of dapivirine delivery to plasma, vaginal, and rectal fluid and rectal, vaginal, and cervical tissue over 28 days of exposure and 3 and 7 days after removal of the ring. The findings of the general toxicology study supported the existing data from both preclinical and clinical studies in that there were no signs of toxicity related to dapivirine. In addition, the presence of the physical dapivirine ring did not alter local or systemic toxicity or the pharmacokinetics of dapivirine. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the dapivirine ring produced significant vaginal tissue levels of dapivirine. However, no dapivirine was detected in cervical tissue samples using the methods described here. Plasma and vaginal fluid levels were lower than those in previous clinical studies, while there were detectable dapivirine levels in the rectal tissue and fluid. All tissue and fluid levels tailed off rapidly to undetectable levels following removal of the ring. The sheep represents a very useful model for the assessment of the safety and pharmacokinetics of microbicide drug delivery devices, such as the vaginal ring."

Microscopic analysis revealed that GFP-labelled 20S as well as 19S subunits are accumulated mainly in the nuclear envelope (NE)-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network in yeast. These findings were supported by the co-localization and co-enrichment of 26S proteasomes with NE-ER marker proteins. A major location of proteasomal peptide cleavage activity was visualized in the NE-ER network, indicating that proteasomal degradation takes place mainly in this subcellular compartment in yeast."

In a subgroup analysis, adverse events were more frequent in older children, children with type 3 spinal muscular atrophy, and with a 21- or 22-gauge needle compared to a 24-gauge needle or smaller.

Anti-pT668 immunostaining of AD brain sections with hydrated autoclave enhancement identified SP neurites and NFTs in which pT668-ACD colocalizes with tau. We produced and examined transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress human APP695, harboring the double Swedish/London mutation, and develop age-dependently Abeta plaques in the brain. All Abeta plaques contain co-accumulations of pT668-ACD, but co-accumulation of tau appears in only a fraction of Abeta plaques in older animals. We also examined the established tau Tg mice that overexpress the smallest human brain tau isoform and develop neuronal accumulations of tau in older animals. Examination of the old tau Tg mice showed that neuronal cells affected by tau accumulation induce co-accumulation of pT668-ACD. We speculate that in AD brains, extracellular Abeta deposition is accompanied by intracellular accumulation of pT668-ACD, followed by tau accumulation in the SP with dystrophic neurites and that neuronal cells affected by tau accumulation induce co-accumulation of pT668-ACD in NFTs. Thus, pT668-ACD is likely to mediate pathological interaction between Abeta and tau."

A major breakthrough in understanding the etiology of neurological disorders is the recent insight on the role of the gut microbiota (GM). Human GM also referred to as the \"forgotten organ\" is home to 10(13-14) microorganisms, which is 10 times the number of cells present in the human body. In addition, the gut microbiome (total genome of GM) is 150 times greater as compared to the human genome. An emerging concept gaining worldwide focus and acceptance is that, this much big genome can potentially control human behavior and other biological functions. Herein we hypothesize on the basis of GM's ability to modify brain and behavior and that it can directly or indirectly control social behavior. This review focuses on the association of GM with various domains of social behavior like stress, cognition and anxiety. "

MRP1 (ABCC1) is one of 13 polytopic membrane proteins that comprise the 'C' subfamily of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins. MRP1 and related ABCC family members, including MRP2, 3, 4 and 5 (ABCC2, 3, 4 and 5), each have a distinctive pattern of tissue expression and substrate specificity. Together, these five transporters play important roles in the disposition and elimination of drugs and other organic anions, and in maintenance of blood-tissue barriers, as confirmed by enhanced chemosensitivity of respective knockout mice. Moreover, Mrp2 (Abcc2) deficient animals display mild conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, corresponding to a human condition known as Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS). Naturally occurring mutations in MRP/ABCC-related drug transporters have been reported, some of which are non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. The consequences of the resulting amino acid changes can sometimes be predicted from in vitro site-directed mutagenesis studies or from knowledge of mutations of analogous (conserved) residues in ABCC proteins that cause DJS, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (ABCC6), cystic fibrosis (CFTR/ABCC7) or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (SUR1/ABCC8). Continual updating of databases of sequence variants and haplotype analysis, together with in vitro biochemical validation assays and pharmacological studies in knockout animals, should make it possible to determine how genetic variation in the MRP-related transporters contributes to the range of responses to drugs and chemicals observed in different human populations."

We estimate that the combined incidence of ALD and its variants in Australasia is at least 1.6 per 100,000. Of 95 affected males, 51 had cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, 24 had adrenomyeloneuropathy, 15 had Addison's disease only, and 5 remained asymptomatic when last examined. However, the distribution of phenotypes among newly diagnosed patients has changed substantially over the last 15 years, with cerebral forms of the disease forming a decreasing proportion of new diagnoses. The measurement of plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) alone detects 93% of women who can be proven to be carriers. The addition of genetic linkage studies or assay of VLCFAs in cultured fibroblasts improved this detection rate to the point that there were no obligate carriers who could not be detected using a combination of two or more techniques."

How these clusters are formed during evolution is unknown. The DAL cluster is the largest metabolic gene cluster in yeast and consists of six adjacent genes encoding proteins that enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use allantoin as a nitrogen source. We show here that the DAL cluster was assembled, quite recently in evolutionary terms, through a set of genomic rearrangements that happened almost simultaneously. Six of the eight genes involved in allantoin degradation, which were previously scattered around the genome, became relocated to a single subtelomeric site in an ancestor of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces castellii. These genomic rearrangements coincided with a biochemical reorganization of the purine degradation pathway, which switched to importing allantoin instead of urate. This change eliminated urate oxidase, one of several oxygen-consuming enzymes that were lost by yeasts that can grow vigorously in anaerobic conditions. The DAL cluster is located in a domain of modified chromatin involving both H2A.Z histone exchange and Hst1-Sum1-mediated histone deacetylation, and it may be a coadapted gene complex formed by epistatic selection."

Previously, we found C-terminal-truncated fragments of apoE in AD brains and showed that such fragments can cause neurodegeneration and can induce NFT-like inclusions in cultured neuronal cells and in transgenic mice. Here, we analyzed apoE fragmentation in brain tissue homogenates from transgenic mice expressing apoE3 or apoE4 in neurons [neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-apoE] or astrocytes [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-apoE] by Western blotting. The C-terminal-truncated fragments of apoE accumulated, in an age-dependent manner, in the brains of NSE-apoE4 and, to a significantly lesser extent, NSE-apoE3 mice; however, no fragments were detected in GFAP-apoE3 or GFAP-apoE4 mice. In NSE-apoE mice, the pattern of apoE fragmentation resembled that seen in AD brains, and the fragmentation was specific for certain brain regions, occurring in the neocortex and hippocampus, which are vulnerable to AD-related neurodegeneration, but not in the less vulnerable cerebellum. Excitotoxic challenge with kainic acid significantly increased apoE fragmentation in NSE-apoE4 but not NSE-apoE3 mice. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) also accumulated in an age-dependent manner in NSE-apoE4 mice and, to a much lesser extent, in NSE-apoE3 mice but not in GFAP-apoE3 or GFAP-apoE4 mice. Intraneuronal p-tau inclusions in the hippocampus were prominent in 21-month-old NSE-apoE4 mice but barely detectable in NSE-apoE3 mice. Thus, the accumulation of potentially pathogenic C-terminal-truncated fragments of apoE depends on both the isoform and the cellular source of apoE. Neuron-specific proteolytic cleavage of apoE4 is associated with increased phosphorylation of tau and may play a key role in the development of AD-related neuronal deficits."

Knowledge about the morphology and behavior of Bacillus anthracis changed little while in transit between these nodes, even during complex debates about the nature of bacterial morphology, disease causation, and spontaneous generation. Working independently of their more famous counterparts (Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur), Anglo-American anthrax investigators used visual representations of anthrax bacilli to persuade their peers that a specific, identifiable cause produced all forms of anthrax-malignant pustule (cutaneous anthrax), intestinal anthrax, and woolsorter's disease (pneumonic anthrax). By the late 1870s, this point of view also supported what we would today call an ecological notion of the disease's origins in the interactions of people, animals, and microorganisms in the context of global commerce."

Clinically it is characterized by growth and body proportion abnormalities, gonadal dysgenesis resulting in sexual infantilism, primary amenorrhoea, infertility, characteristic stigmata, anomalies of heart, renal and bones and the presence of some diseases like Hashimoto thyroiditis with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoporosis, hypertension. Turner's syndrome occurs in 1:2000 to 1:2500 female livebirth. The most frequent X chromosome aberrations in patients with phenotype of Turner syndrome are as follows: X monosomy - 45,X; mosaicism (50-75%), including 45,X/46,XX (10-15%), 45,X/46,XY (2-6%), 45,X/46,X,i(Xq), 45,X/46,X,del(Xp), 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX; aberration of X structure: total or partial deletion of short arm of X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) isochromosom of long arm of X chromosome (46,X,(i(Xq)), ring chromosome (46, X,r(X)), marker chromosome (46,X+m). Searching of X chromosome and mapping and sequencing of genes located at this chromosome (such as SHOX, ODG2, VSPA, SOX 3) have made possible to look for linkage between phenotypes and adequate genes or regions of X chromosome. In this paper current data concerning correlation between phenotype and karyotype in patients with TS have been presented."

Here we report an activator-dependent interaction of transcription initiation and termination factors during gene looping in budding yeast. Chromatin analysis revealed that MET16, INO1, and GAL1p-BUD3 are in a stable looped configuration during activated transcription. Looping was nearly abolished in the absence of transcription activators Met28, Ino2, and Gal4 of MET16, INO1, and GAL1p-BUD3 genes, respectively. The activator-independent increase in transcription was not accompanied by loop formation, thereby suggesting an essential role for activators in gene looping. The activators did not facilitate loop formation directly because they did not exhibit an interaction with the 3' end of the genes. Instead, activators physically interacted with the general transcription factor TFIIB when the genes were activated and in a looped configuration. TFIIB cross-linked to both the promoter and the terminator regions during the transcriptionally activated state of a gene. The presence of TFIIB on the terminator was dependent on the Rna15 component of CF1 3' end processing complex. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a physical interaction of Rna15 with TFIIB. We propose that the activators facilitate gene looping through their interaction with TFIIB during transcriptional activation of genes."

A full-length buffalo DGAT1 genomic DNA was amplified by iterative PCR based on homolog cloning. The buffalo DGAT1 gene comprises 17 exons and spans approximately 8.3 kb. The genomic structures of DGAT1 are highly conserved among mammal species. The deduced protein of buffalo DGAT1 contains 489 amino acids, showing high-sequence similarity with mammal homologs. Through PCR-SSCP analysis and sequencing, seven polymorphic positions were detected in the complete genomic region of buffalo DGAT1, and their frequencies were observed from a collection of 117 buffalo. The SNP (C/T) detected at position 11785 in exon 17 creates a substitution change for the amino acid sequence, resulting in an Ala residue (GCG) transition to a Val residue (GTG) in position 484 of buffalo DGAT1 protein.

To date, glial tumours from the Tunisian population have not been investigated. To address this, we correlated the clinico-pathology with molecular data of 110 gliomas by a combination of HM450K array, MLPA and TMA-IHC. PTEN loss and EGFR amplification were distributed in different glioma histological groups. However, 1p19q co-deletion and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion were, respectively, restricted to Oligodendroglioma and Pilocytic Astrocytoma. CDKN2A loss and EGFR overexpression were more common within high-grade gliomas. Furthermore, survival statistical correlations led us to identify Glioblastoma (GB) prognosis subtypes. In fact, significant lower overall survival (OS) was detected within GB that overexpressed EGFR and Cox2. In addition, IDH1R132H mutation seemed to provide a markedly survival advantage. Interestingly, the association of IDHR132H mutation and EGFR normal status, as well as the association of differentiation markers, defined GB subtypes with good prognosis. By contrast, poor survival GB subtypes were defined by the combination of PTEN loss with PDGFRa expression and/or EGFR amplification. Additionally, GB presenting p53-negative staining associated with CDKN2A loss or p21 positivity represented a subtype with short survival. Thus, distinct molecular subtypes with individualised prognosis were identified. Interestingly, we found a unique histone mutation in a poor survival young adult GB case. This tumour exceptionally associated the H3F3A G34R mutation and MYCN amplification as well as 1p36 loss and 10q loss. Furthermore, by exhibiting a remarkable methylation profile, it emphasised the oncogenic power of G34R mutation connecting gliomagenesis and chromatin regulation."

Analogously to mRNAs, the non-protein-encoding pri-miRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and post-transcriptionally modified by addition of a 5'-cap and a 3'-poly (A) tail. Subsequently, the pri-miRNA undergoes a number of processing steps in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and ends up as a mature approximately 22 nt miRNA, which can exert its function by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of a subset of mRNAs. Binding of the miRNA to the mRNA results in a reduced translation rate and/or increased degradation of the mRNA. In this way a large number of cellular pathways, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are regulated by mi-RNAs. As corruption of these pathways is the hallmark of many cancers, dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis or expression levels may lead to tumorigenesis. The mechanisms that alter the expression of miRNAs are similar to those that change the expression levels of mRNAs of tumor suppressor- and oncogenes, i.e. gross genomic aberrations, epigenetic changes, and minor mutations affecting the expression level, processing, or target-interaction potential of the miRNA. Furthermore, expression profiling of miRNAs has been found to be useful for classification of different tumor types. Taken together, miRNAs can be classified as onco-miRs or tumor suppressor-miRs, and may turn out to be potential targets for cancer therapy."

This dynamic alteration in nucleosome structure provides a molecular mechanism to regulate transcription, gene silencing, chromosome segregation and DNA repair. Here we show that genetic instability, sensitivity to drugs impairing different cellular processes and genome-wide transcriptional misregulation in htz1Delta can be partially or totally suppressed if SWR1 is not formed (swr1Delta), if it forms but cannot bind to chromatin (swc2Delta) or if it binds to chromatin but lacks histone replacement activity (swc5Delta and the ATPase-dead swr1-K727G). These results suggest that in htz1Delta the nucleosome remodelling activity of SWR1 affects chromatin integrity because of an attempt to replace H2A with Htz1 in the absence of the latter. This would impair transcription and, either directly or indirectly, other cellular processes. Specifically, we show that in htz1Delta, the SWR1 complex causes an accumulation of recombinogenic DNA damage by a mechanism dependent on phosphorylation of H2A at Ser129, a modification that occurs in response to DNA damage, suggesting that the SWR1 complex impairs the repair of spontaneous DNA damage in htz1Delta. In addition, SWR1 causes DSBs sensitivity in htz1Delta; consistently, in the absence of Htz1 the SWR1 complex bound near an endonuclease HO-induced DSB at the mating-type (MAT) locus impairs DSB-induced checkpoint activation. Our results support a stepwise mechanism for the replacement of H2A with Htz1 and demonstrate that a tight control of this mechanism is essential to regulate chromatin dynamics but also to prevent the deleterious consequences of an incomplete nucleosome remodelling."

To identify novel ODA loci, we conducted targeted high-throughput sequencing of 407 candidate genes in an initial cohort of 22 sporadic ODA patients. Patched 1 (PTCH1), an inhibitor of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, harbored an enrichment of rare heterozygous variants in comparison to either controls, or to the other candidate genes (four missense and one frameshift); targeted resequencing of PTCH1 in a second cohort of 48 ODA patients identified two additional rare nonsynonymous changes. Using multiple transient models and a CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutant, we show physiologically relevant phenotypes altering SHH signaling and eye development upon abrogation of ptch1 in zebrafish for which in vivo complementation assays using these models showed that all six patient missense mutations affect SHH signaling. Finally, through transcriptomic and ChIP analyses, we show that SOX2 binds to an intronic domain of the PTCH1 locus to regulate PTCH1 expression, findings that were validated both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that PTCH1 mutations contribute to as much as 10% of ODA, identify the SHH signaling pathway as a novel effector of SOX2 activity during human ocular development, and indicate that ODA is likely the result of overactive SHH signaling in humans harboring mutations in either PTCH1 or SOX2."

Gene looping has been shown to play important roles in transcription. Gene-loop formation is dependent on regulatory proteins localized at the 5' and 3' ends of genes, such as TFIIB. However, whether other factors contribute to gene looping remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the contribution of intrinsic DNA and chromatin structures to gene looping. We found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae looped genes show high DNA bendability around middle and 3/4 regions in open reading frames (ORFs). This bendability pattern is conserved between yeast species, whereas the position of bendability peak varies substantially among species. Looped genes in human cells also show high DNA bendability. Nucleosome positioning around looped ORF middle regions is unstable. We also present evidence indicating that this unstable nucleosome positioning is involved in gene looping. These results suggest a mechanism by which DNA bendability and unstable nucleosome positioning could assist in the formation of gene loops. "

This highly restricted distribution must be co-determined by the thymidine hydroxylases (JBP1 and JBP2) that catalyze the initial step in J synthesis. To determine the DNA sequences recognized by JBP1/2, we used SMRT sequencing of DNA segments inserted into plasmids grown in Leishmania tarentolae. We show that SMRT sequencing recognizes base J in DNA. Leishmania DNA segments that normally contain J also picked up J when present in the plasmid, whereas control sequences did not. Even a segment of only 10 telomeric (GGGTTA) repeats was modified in the plasmid. We show that J modification usually occurs at pairs of Ts on opposite DNA strands, separated by 12 nucleotides. Modifications occur near G-rich sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes and JBP2 is needed, as it does not occur in JBP2-null cells. We propose a model whereby de novo J insertion is mediated by JBP2. JBP1 then binds to J and hydroxylates another T 13 bp downstream (but not upstream) on the complementary strand, allowing JBP1 to maintain existing J following DNA replication. "

They have diverse biological functions, including the regulation of growth factor signaling, mitochondrial fusion, and parasite invasion. Despite their existence in all branches of life, the sequence identity between rhomboids is low. We have combined BLAST-based database mining with functional and structural data to generate a comprehensive genomic analysis of eukaryotic rhomboid-like proteins. We show that robust membrane topology models are necessary to classify active rhomboid proteases unambiguously, and we define rules for distinguishing predicted active proteases from the larger evolutionary group of rhomboid-like proteins. This leads to a revision of estimates of numbers of proteolytically active rhomboids. We identify three groups of eukaryotic rhomboid-like proteins: true active rhomboids, a tightly clustered group of novel inactive rhomboids that we name the iRhoms, and a small number of other inactive rhomboid-like proteins. The active proteases are themselves subdivided into secretase and PARL-type (mitochondrial) subfamilies; these have distinct transmembrane topologies. This enhanced genomic analysis leads to conclusions about rhomboid enzyme function. It suggests that a given rhomboid can only cleave a single orientation of substrate, and that both products of rhomboid catalyzed intramembrane cleavage can be released from the membrane. Our phylogeny predictions also have evolutionary implications: Despite the complex classification of rhomboids, our data suggest that a rhomboid-type intramembrane protease may have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor."

The CCAAT enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) is expressed as multiple isoforms and has been shown to be essential to myeloid (granulocyte) terminal differentiation. We have defined a novel synergistic, as opposed to antagonistic, combinatorial interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1, and a unique repressor role for certain C/EBPepsilon isoforms in the transcriptional regulation of a model eosinophil granulocyte gene, the major basic protein (MBP). The eosinophil-specific P2 promoter of the MBP gene contains GATA-1, C/EBP, and PU.1 consensus sites that bind these factors in nuclear extracts of the eosinophil myelocyte cell line, AML14.3D10. The promoter is transactivated by GATA-1 alone but is synergistically transactivated by low levels of PU.1 in the context of optimal levels of GATA-1. The C/EBPepsilon(27) isoform strongly represses GATA-1 activity and completely blocks GATA-1/PU.1 synergy. In vitro mutational analyses of the MBP-P2 promoter showed that both the GATA-1/PU.1 synergy, and repressor activity of C/EBPepsilon(27) are mediated via protein-protein interactions through the C/EBP and/or GATA-binding sites but not the PU.1 sites. Co-immunoprecipitations using lysates of AML14.3D10 eosinophils show that both C/EBPepsilon(32/30) and epsilon(27) physically interact in vivo with PU.1 and GATA-1, demonstrating functional interactions among these factors in eosinophil progenitors. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27)."

A newborn infant was referred for genetic evaluation because of abnormal male external genitalia. The infant had severe penile/scrotal hypospadias. Gonads were palpable. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a de novo mosaic 46,XX,dup(17)(q23.1q24.3)/46, XX karyotype. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a BAC clone containing the SOX9 gene demonstrated that the SOX9 gene is duplicated on the rearranged chromosome 17. The presence of SRY was ruled out by FISH with a probe containing the SRY gene and polymerase chain reaction with SRY-specific primers. Microsatellite analysis with 13 markers on 17q23-24 determined that the duplication is maternal in origin and defined the boundary of the duplication to be approximately 12 centimorgans (cM) proximal and 4 cM distal to the SOX9 gene. Thus, SOX9 duplication is the most likely cause for the sex reversal in this case because it plays an important role in male sex determination and differentiation. This study suggests that extra dose of SOX9 is sufficient to initiate testis differentiation in the absence of SRY. Other SRY-negative XX sex-reversed individuals deserve thorough investigation of SOX9 gene."

We previously identified a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) in human and mouse brain. Here we show that this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7). ciRS-7 contains more than 70 selectively conserved miRNA target sites, and it is highly and widely associated with Argonaute (AGO) proteins in a miR-7-dependent manner. Although the circRNA is completely resistant to miRNA-mediated target destabilization, it strongly suppresses miR-7 activity, resulting in increased levels of miR-7 targets. In the mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7, particularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of endogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA."

We have investigated this hypothesis by performing linkage studies in 12 multiplex families with the Marfan syndrome, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) associated with 3 genes encoding chains of fibrillar collagens. The data exclude linkage to all 3 candidate genes in 2 families and at least 1 of the candidates is excluded in 6 additional families. Each candidate was excluded in at least 3 families. In no case was strong evidence in favor of linkage of the Marfan syndrome to any of the 3 genes observed. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome."

CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3). This conclusion is supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in these conditions. Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome and the first in a new line of drugs designed for longer-acting IL-1 blockade. Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS. The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review. Rilonacept is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring weekly rather than daily self-administration. Other autoinflammatory disorders may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, gout and familial mediterranean fever."

Tropilaelaps is hence considered more dangerous to A. mellifera than the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Honey bees are also infected by many different viruses, some of them associated with and vectored by V. destructor. In recent years, deformed wing virus (DWV) has become the most prevalent virus infection in honey bees associated with V. destructor. DWV is distributed world-wide, and found wherever the Varroa mite is found, although low levels of the virus can also be found in Varroa free colonies. The Varroa mite transmits viral particles when feeding on the haemolymph of pupae or adult bees. Both the Tropilaelaps mite and the Varroa mite feed on honey bee brood, but no observations of DWV in Tropilaelaps have so far been reported. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to show the presence of DWV in infested brood and Tropilaelaps mercedesae mites collected in China, and to demonstrate a close quantitative association between mite-infested pupae of A. mellifera and DWV infections. Phylogenetic analysis of the DWV sequences recovered from matching pupae and mites revealed considerable DWV sequence heterogeneity and polymorphism. These polymorphisms appeared to be associated with the individual brood cell, rather than with a particular host."

Nine of the 14 mutations are predicted to significantly disrupt the protein products of G4.5. The occurrence of missense mutations in exons 3 and 8 suggests that these exons encode essential portions of the G4. 5 proteins, whose functions remain unknown. We found no correlation between the location or type of mutation and any of the clinical or laboratory abnormalities of Barth syndrome, which suggests that additional factors modify the expression of the Barth phenotype.

Their step-wise transcriptional activation follows their genomic topology and the various states of activation are subsequently memorized into domains of progressively overlapping gene products. We have analyzed the 3D chromatin organization of Hox clusters during their early activation in vivo, using high-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture. Initially, Hox clusters are organized as single chromatin compartments containing all genes and bivalent chromatin marks. Transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3D organization, whereby the genes switch autonomously from an inactive to an active compartment. These local 3D dynamics occur within a framework of constitutive interactions within the surrounding Topological Associated Domains, indicating that this regulation process is mostly cluster intrinsic. The step-wise progression in time is fixed at various body levels and thus can account for the chromatin architectures previously described at a later stage for different anterior to posterior levels.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02557.001.

Gene discoveries have also provided insights into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis and remodeling. Interestingly, at least half of these key molecular genetic studies were initiated with the benefit of prior knowledge of relevant proteins. In addition, multiple important findings originated from studies in mouse, and from other types of non-genetic approaches. Although it appears by now that the main lipid pathways have been uncovered, and that only modulators or adaptor proteins such as those encoded by LDLRAP1, APOA5, ANGPLT3/4, and PCSK9 are currently being discovered, genome wide association studies (GWAS) in particular have implicated many new loci based on statistical analyses; these may prove to have equally large impacts on lipoprotein traits as gene products that are already known. On the other hand, since 2004 - and particularly since 2010 when massively parallel sequencing has become de rigeur - no major new insights into genes governing lipid metabolism have been reported. This is probably because the etiologies of true Mendelian lipid disorders with overt clinical complications have been largely resolved. In the meantime, it has become clear that proving the importance of new candidate genes is challenging. This could be due to very low frequencies of large impact variants in the population. It must further be emphasized that functional genetic studies, while necessary, are often difficult to accomplish, making it hazardous to upgrade a variant that is simply associated to being definitively causative. Also, it is clear that applying a monogenic approach to dissect complex lipid traits that are mostly of polygenic origin is the wrong way to proceed. The hope is that large-scale data acquisition combined with sophisticated computerized analyses will help to prioritize and select the most promising candidate genes for future research. We suggest that at this point in time, investment in sequence technology driven candidate gene discovery could be recalibrated by refocusing efforts on direct functional analysis of the genes that have already been discovered.

By targeted testing of variants within candidate genes, potential predictors of anti-TNF response have been reported; however, very few markers have replicated consistently between studies. Emerging genome-wide association studies suggest that there may be a number of genes with modest effects on treatment response rather than a few genes of large effect.

METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who had undergone surgery using an EETTA to the IAC at 2 university tertiary care referral centers during the period from November 2011 to January 2015. RESULTS Ten patients underwent surgery via an EETTA for the treatment of VS in the IAC at the University Hospital of Modena or the University Hospital of Verona. The patients had Koos Grade I or II tumors and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Class D hearing status preoperatively. Gross-total resection was achieved in all patients. No major complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or hemorrhage were reported. In 7 of 10 (70%) patients, facial nerve function was normal immediately after surgery (Rough Grading System [RGS] Grade I). Two patients presented with a transitory facial palsy immediately after surgery (RGS Grade II-III) but experienced complete recovery during the follow-up period. The mean follow-up was 10 months. CONCLUSIONS The EETTA proved to be successful for the removal of VS or meningioma involving the cochlea, fundus, and IAC, with possible lower complication rates and less invasive procedures than those for traditional microscopic approaches. The potential for the extensive and routine use of this approach in lateral and posterior skull base surgery will depend on the development of technology and surgical refinements and on the diffusion of skull base endoscopic skills among the otolaryngological and neurosurgical communities."

For sap-feeding insects, sequenced symbiont genomes are available only for phloem-feeding examples from the suborder Sternorrhyncha and xylem-feeding examples from the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, confounding comparisons. We sequenced genomes of the obligate symbionts, Sulcia muelleri and Nasuia deltocephalinicola, of the phloem-feeding pest insect, Macrosteles quadrilineatus (Auchenorrhyncha: Cicadellidae). Our results reveal that Nasuia-ALF has the smallest bacterial genome yet sequenced (112 kb), and that the Sulcia-ALF genome (190 kb) is smaller than that of Sulcia in other insect lineages. Together, these symbionts retain the capability to synthesize the 10 essential amino acids, as observed for several symbiont pairs from xylem-feeding Auchenorrhyncha. Nasuia retains genes enabling synthesis of two amino acids, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Both symbionts have lost genes underlying ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, possibly as a consequence of the enriched sugar content of phloem. Shared genomic features, including reassignment of the UGA codon from Stop to tryptophan, and phylogenetic results suggest that Nasuia-ALF is most closely related to Zinderia, the betaproteobacterial symbiont of spittlebugs. Thus, Nasuia/Zinderia and Sulcia likely represent ancient associates that have co-resided in hosts since the divergence of leafhoppers and spittlebugs >200 Ma, and possibly since the origin of the Auchenorrhyncha, >260 Ma.

Two new genes linked to two different forms of hereditary hypophosphatemias have recently been described. Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. Intact plasma levels of the phosphaturic protein FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23) were clearly elevated in some of the affected individuals, providing a possible explanation for the phosphaturia and inappropriately normal 1,25(OH)2D levels, and suggesting that DMP1 may regulate FGF23 expression. Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria is another rare disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. Affected individuals present with hypercalciuria due to increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption. The disease was mapped to a 1.6 Mbp region on chromosome 9q34, which contains SLC34A3, the gene encoding the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIc. This was the first demonstration that NaPi-IIc has a key role in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis. Thus, DMP1 and NaPi-IIc add two new members to the bone-kidney axis proposed since it was discovered that the first phosphatonin, FGF23, was of osteoblastic/osteocyte origin. This provides a mechanism for the skeleton to communicate with the kidney to coordinate the mineralization of extracelular matrix and the renal handling of phosphate."

Although several web servers and stand-alone tools were developed to address this problem, all these tools, however, can only handle one type of samples. Furthermore, the number of their built-in properties is limited, and hence it is often difficult for users to formulate the biological sequences according to their desired features or properties. In this article, with a much larger number of built-in properties, we are to propose a much more flexible web server called Pse-in-One (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-in-One/), which can, through its 28 different modes, generate nearly all the possible feature vectors for DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Particularly, it can also generate those feature vectors with the properties defined by users themselves. These feature vectors can be easily combined with machine-learning algorithms to develop computational predictors and analysis methods for various tasks in bioinformatics and system biology. It is anticipated that the Pse-in-One web server will become a very useful tool in computational proteomics, genomics, as well as biological sequence analysis. Moreover, to maximize users' convenience, its stand-alone version can also be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-in-One/download/, and directly run on Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS.

DBA is the first human disease due to mutations in a ribosomal structural protein. Families unlinked to this locus have also been reported. In an investigation of 23 individuals, we identified eight different mutations in 9 patients. These include five missense, one frameshift, one splice site defect, and one 4-bp insertion in the regulatory sequence. Seven mutations are new; one has so far been found in 8 patients and is a relatively common de novo event. Two mutations are predicted to generate a truncated protein. We also report the prevalence of RPS 19 mutations in the Italian DBA population, as shown by an analysis of 56 patients. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with the same mutation. The main clinical applications for molecular analysis are clinical diagnosis of patients with an incomplete form of DBA and testing of siblings of a patient with a severe form so as to avoid using those who carry a mutation and a silent phenotype as allogeneic stem cell donors."

Despite recognition as the CB marker protein, coilin is primarily nucleoplasmic, and the function of this fraction is not fully characterized. Here we show that coilin binds double stranded DNA and has RNase activity in vitro. U1 and U2 snRNAs undergo a processing event of the primary transcript prior to incorporation in the snRNP. We find that coilin displays RNase activity within the CU region of the U2 snRNA primary transcript in vitro, and that coilin knockdown results in accumulation of the 3' pre-processed U1 and U2 snRNA. These findings present new characteristics of coilin in vitro, and suggest additional functions of the protein in vivo."

Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease."

Wild-type F. graminearum (strain PH-1) and two isogenic transformants lacking either the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP1 gene or the trichodiene synthase TRI5 gene were individually spray- or point-inoculated onto Arabidopsis and wheat floral tissue. Disease development was quantitatively assessed both macroscopically and microscopically and deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin concentrations determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Wild-type strain inoculations caused high levels of disease in both plant species and significant DON production. The map1 mutant caused minimal disease and DON accumulation in both hosts. The tri5 mutant, which is unable to produce DON, exhibited reduced pathogenicity on wheat ears, causing only discrete eye-shaped lesions on spikelets which failed to infect the rachis. By contrast, the tri5 mutant retained full pathogenicity on Arabidopsis floral tissue. This study reveals that DON mycotoxin production is not required for F. graminearum to colonize Arabidopsis floral tissue."

On the other hand, overexpressing an adult dADAR isoform with high enzymatic activity ubiquitously during larval and pupal stages is lethal. Advantage was taken of this to screen for genetic modifiers; Adar overexpression lethality is rescued by reduced dosage of the Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin), gene encoding a subunit of inhibitory GABA receptors. Reduced dosage of the Gad1 gene encoding the GABA synthetase also rescues Adar overexpression lethality. Drosophila Adar(5G1) mutant phenotypes are ameliorated by feeding GABA modulators. We demonstrate that neuronal excitability is linked to dADAR expression levels in individual neurons; Adar-overexpressing larval motor neurons show reduced excitability whereas Adar(5G1) null mutant or targeted Adar knockdown motor neurons exhibit increased excitability. GABA inhibitory signalling is impaired in human epileptic and autistic conditions, and vertebrate ADARs may have a relevant evolutionarily conserved control over neuronal excitability. "

In order to investigate the effects of hCG on clinical endpoints, knowledge on reference range (RR) methodology and determinants of gestational hCG levels is crucial. Moreover, a better understanding of gestational hCG physiology can improve current screening programs and future clinical management. Serum total hCG levels were determined in 8195 women participating in the Generation R Study. Gestational age specific RRs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (US RRs) were calculated and compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (LMP RRs) and a model-based RR. We also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hCG levels. Compared to the US RRs, the LMP RRs were lower, most notably for the median and lower limit levels. No considerable differences were found between RRs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only. Maternal smoking, BMI, parity, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight and hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms were associated with total hCG. We provide gestational RRs for total hCG and show that total hCG values and RR cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology. This is likely due to the influence of hCG on embryonic growth, suggesting that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hCG levels. Furthermore, we identify different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hCG levels considerably and should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies. "

Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Expression of wild-type human PRDM12 in Xenopus induced the expression of sensory neuronal markers, which was reduced using various human PRDM12 mutants. In Drosophila, we identified Hamlet as the functional PRDM12 homolog that controls nociceptive behavior in sensory neurons. Furthermore, expression analysis of human patient fibroblasts with PRDM12 mutations uncovered possible downstream target genes. Knockdown of several of these target genes including thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme (TRHDE) in Drosophila sensory neurons resulted in altered cellular morphology and impaired nociception. These data show that PRDM12 and its functional fly homolog Hamlet are evolutionary conserved master regulators of sensory neuronal specification and play a critical role in pain perception. Our data also uncover novel pathways in multiple species that regulate evolutionary conserved nociception. "

We employed yeast chronological and replicative lifespan assays, as well as oxidative stress assays, to explore the potential evolutionary conservation of function between the FOXOs and the yeast forkhead box transcription factors FKH1 and FKH2. We report that the deletion of both FKH genes impedes normal lifespan and stress resistance, particularly in stationary phase cells, which are non-responsive to caloric restriction. Conversely, increased expression of the FKHs leads to extended lifespan and improved stress response. Here we show the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) genetically interacts with the Fkh pathway, likely working in a linear pathway under normal conditions, as fkh1\u0394 fkh2\u0394 post-mitotic survival is epistatic to that observed in apc5(CA) mutants. However, under stress conditions, post-mitotic survival is dramatically impaired in apc5(CA) fkh1\u0394 fkh2\u0394, while increased expression of either FKH rescues APC mutant growth defects. This study establishes the FKHs role as evolutionarily conserved regulators of lifespan in yeast and identifies the APC as a novel component of this mechanism under certain conditions, likely through combined regulation of stress response, genomic stability, and cell cycle regulation."

One particular subtype, tardive dyskinesia, is characterized by rapid, repetitive, stereotypic, involuntary movements of the face, limbs or trunk. The inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter system, using tetrabenazine therapy, improves the severity of tardive dyskinesia. But there are also drawbacks to tetrabenazine treatment, such as a fluctuating response and the need for frequent intake due to its rapid metabolism. Clinical research on the potentially more efficacious and easier to use tetrabenazine analogs is already under way. One of them is valbenazine, the purified parent drug of the (+)-\u03b1-isomer of tetrabenazine. The FDA lowered approval hurdles for valbenazine due to a successful Phase II trial, which showed a distinctive improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms during valbenazine administration. This resurgence in the clinical research of tardive syndrome therapy is most welcome. This author notes that the putative long-term side effects of valbenazine should carefully be investigated in the future via naturalistic observational trials. Furthermore, valbenazine may also support the onset of symptoms, such as Parkinsonism and depression, with chronic administration, as it, to a certain extent, shares the mode of action of tetrabenazine.

Recently supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis. Our work combines both analytical and experimental techniques to show that SSCprofiler is a highly accurate tool which can be used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates in the human genome.

Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a \u03b2-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org). "

During carcinogenesis, the expression of many genes is altered alongside extensive changes in the epigenome, with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. However the spectrum of alterations that occur at distal regulatory regions has not been extensively studied. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession GSE57498.

The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence. The DosR regulon is regulated by a two-component regulatory system consisting of two sensor kinases-DosS (Rv3132c) and DosT (Rv2027c), and a response regulator DosR (Rv3133c). The underlying regulatory mechanism of DosR regulon expression is very complex. Many factors are involved, particularly the oxygen tension. The DosR regulon enables the pathogen to persist during lengthy hypoxia. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that the DosR regulon is widely distributed among the mycobacterial genomes, ranging from the pathogenic strains to the environmental strains. In-depth studies on the DosR response should provide insights into its role in TB latency in vivo and shape new measures to combat this exceeding recalcitrant pathogen."

Anatomical landmarks indicating support to the urethrovesical junction were evaluated by the position of the urethra at the most dependent point in the bladder on straining and the urethral descent on straining to beneath the posterior ramus of the symphysis pubis on bead chain cystography. The urethrovesical junction drop on straining was evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography. Cystographic and ultrasonographic tests for the position of the urethrovesical junction at the most dependent position in the bladder during straining were very sensitive in women with stress urinary incontinence (94 and 87% respectively) but much less specific (45 and 48% respectively). When evaluating anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction and its descent on straining, these tests were both highly sensitive (97 and 94% respectively) and specific (76 and 96% respectively) in women with genuine stress urinary incontinence. Simple clinical tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence. Transrectal ultrasonography is a simple and quick out-patient procedure. The availability of ultrasound equipment in most clinics and the high sensitivity and specificity of the test make it an attractive and cost-effective alternative to X-ray cystography in the pre-operative evaluation of anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction."

Zinc cluster transcription factors play a central role in the transcriptional regulation of drug resistance. Mrr1 regulates the expression of the major facilitator MDR1, Tac1 controls the expression of the ABC transporters CDR1 and CDR2, and Upc2 regulates ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG) genes. Gain-of-function mutations in these transcription factors result in constitutive overexpression of their target genes and are responsible for fluconazole resistance in many clinical C. albicans isolates. The transcription factor Ndt80 contributes to the drug-induced upregulation of CDR1 and ERG genes and also binds to the MDR1 and CDR2 promoters, suggesting that it is an important component of all major transcriptional mechanisms of fluconazole resistance. However, we found that Ndt80 is not required for the induction of MDR1 and CDR2 expression by inducing chemicals. CDR2 was even partially derepressed in ndt80\u0394 mutants, indicating that Ndt80 is a repressor of CDR2 expression. Hyperactive forms of Mrr1, Tac1, and Upc2 promoted overexpression of MDR1, CDR1/CDR2, and ERG11, respectively, with the same efficiency in the presence and absence of Ndt80. Mrr1- and Tac1-mediated fluconazole resistance was even slightly enhanced in ndt80\u0394 mutants compared to wild-type cells. These results demonstrate that Ndt80 is dispensable for the constitutive overexpression of Mrr1, Tac1, and Upc2 target genes and the increased fluconazole resistance of strains that have acquired activating mutations in these transcription factors."

These include the type of colour space used (e.g., RGB, HSV, CIELUV, CIELAB) and different measures of consistency (e.g., city block and Euclidean distance in colour space). This study aims to find the most reliable way of diagnosing grapheme-colour synaesthesia based on maximising sensitivity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true synaesthetes) and specificity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true non-synaesthetes). We show, applying ROC (receiver operating characteristics) to binary classification of a large sample of self-declared synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, that the consistency criterion (i.e., cut-off value) for diagnosing synaesthesia is considerably higher than the current standard in the field. We also show that methods based on perceptual CIELUV and CIELAB colour models (rather than RGB and HSV colour representations) and Euclidean distances offer an even greater sensitivity and specificity than most currently used measures.

Bypass of many of these impediments is facilitated by elongation factor TFIIS through a mechanism that involves cleavage of the nascent transcript by the RNA polymerase II/TFIIS elongation complex. Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The \"intrinsic\" cleavage activity is greatly stimulated at mildly basic pH and requires divalent cations. Both arrested and stalled complexes can carry out the intrinsic cleavage reaction, although not all stalled complexes are equally efficient at this reaction. Arrested complexes in which the nascent transcript was cleaved in the absence of TFIIS were reactivated to readthrough blocks to elongation. Thus, cleavage of the nascent transcript is sufficient for reactivating some arrested complexes. Small RNA products released following transcript cleavage in stalled ternary complexes differ depending upon whether the cleavage has been induced by TFIIS or has occurred in mildly alkaline conditions. In contrast, both intrinsic and TFIIS-induced small RNA cleavage products are very similar when produced from an arrested ternary complex. Although alpha-amanitin interferes with the transcript cleavage stimulated by TFIIS, it has little effect on the intrinsic cleavage reaction. A mutant RNA polymerase previously shown to be refractory to TFIIS-induced transcript cleavage is essentially identical to the wild type polymerase in all tested aspects of intrinsic cleavage."

Models of Pol III based on cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of distinct Pol III conformations reveal unique features distinguishing Pol III from other polymerases. Novel concepts concerning Pol III functioning involve recruitment of general Pol III-specific transcription factors and distinctive mechanisms of transcription initiation, elongation and termination. Despite the short length of Pol III transcription units, mapping of transcriptionally active Pol III with nucleotide resolution has revealed strikingly uneven polymerase distribution along all genes. This may be related, at least in part, to the transcription factors bound at the internal promoter regions. Pol III uses also a specific negative regulator, Maf1, which binds to polymerase under stress conditions; however, a subset of Pol III genes is not controlled by Maf1.

Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely driven primarily by a reduction in food intake."

To examine this variation, and as a first step in the 1001 Genomes Project for this species, we produced 15- to 25-fold coverage in Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) reads for the reference accession, Col-0, and two divergent strains, Bur-0 and Tsu-1. We aligned reads to the reference genome sequence to assess data quality metrics and to detect polymorphisms. Alignments revealed 823,325 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 79,961 unique 1- to 3-bp indels in the divergent accessions at a specificity of >99%, and over 2000 potential errors in the reference genome sequence. We also identified >3.4 Mb of the Bur-0 and Tsu-1 genomes as being either extremely dissimilar, deleted, or duplicated relative to the reference genome. To obtain sequences for these regions, we incorporated the Velvet assembler into a targeted de novo assembly method. This approach yielded 10,921 high-confidence contigs that were anchored to flanking sequences and harbored indels as large as 641 bp. Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the Illumina SBS coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. Our pipeline for aligning reads and predicting SNPs and indels, SHORE, is available for download at http://1001genomes.org."

In mammals, G2 and metaphase cell cycle delays induced by Topo II poisons have been proposed to be the result of checkpoint activation in response to the catenation state of DNA. However, the apparent lack of such controls in model organisms has excluded genetic proof that Topo II checkpoints exist and are separable from the conventional DNA damage checkpoint controls. But here, we define a Topo II-dependent G2/M checkpoint in a genetically amenable eukaryote, budding yeast, and demonstrate that this checkpoint enhances cell survival. Conversely, a lack of the checkpoint results in aneuploidy. Neither DNA damage-responsive pathways nor Pds1/securin are needed for this checkpoint. Unusually, spindle assembly checkpoint components are required for the Topo II checkpoint, but checkpoint activation is not the result of failed chromosome biorientation or a lack of spindle tension. Thus, compromised Topo II function activates a yeast checkpoint system that operates by a novel mechanism."

A number of these cytokines are critical for lymphocyte development and mediating immune responses. JAK3 is of particular interest due to its importance in immune function and its expression, which is largely confined to lymphocytes, thus limiting the potential impact of JAK3 inhibition on nonimmune physiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potency and selectivity of the investigational JAK3 inhibitor VX-509 (decernotinib) [(R)-2-((2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methyl-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)butanamide] against JAK3 kinase activity and inhibition of JAK3-mediated signaling in vitro and JAK3-dependent physiologic processes in vivo. These results demonstrate that VX-509 potently inhibits JAK3 in enzyme assays (Ki = 2.5 nM + 0.7 nM) and cellular assays dependent on JAK3 activity (IC50 range, 50-170 nM), with limited or no measurable potency against other JAK isotypes or non-JAK kinases. VX-509 also showed activity in two animal models of aberrant immune function. VX-509 treatment resulted in dose-dependent reduction in ankle swelling and paw weight and improved paw histopathology scores in the rat collagen-induced arthritis model. In a mouse model of oxazolone-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity, VX-509 reduced the T cell-mediated inflammatory response in skin. These findings demonstrate that VX-509 is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK3 in vitro and modulates proinflammatory response in models of immune-mediated diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and delayed-type hypersensitivity. The data support evaluation of VX-509 for treatment of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. "

The host innate immune response to RNA virus infection primarily involves pathogen-sensing toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3 and TLR7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5). In this study, by using siRNA knockdown, we report that TV infection in LLC-MK2 cells results in an early [3\u2009h post infection (h p.i.), P<0.05] RIG-I-dependent and type I interferon-mediated antiviral response, whereas an MDA5-mediated antiviral effect was observed at later (12\u2009h p.i.; P<0.05) stages of TV replication. Induction of RIG-I and MDA5 was critical for inhibition of TV replication. Furthermore, pre-activation of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway prevented TV replication (>900-fold decrease; P<0.05), suggesting that RIG-I and MDA5 ligands could be used to develop novel preventive and therapeutic measures against norovirus."

Recently, we have shown that the novel DDX1 gene containing a DEAD box motif maps to the same chromosome band as MYCN at 2p24 and is co-amplified with MYCN in retinoblastoma cell lines. Here, we show that the DDX1 gene is co-amplified with the MYCN gene in 2 of three neuroblastoma cell lines and that DDX1 RNA levels correlate with DDX1 gene copy number. Since amplification of MYCN is an indicator of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, it was of interest to determine whether co-amplification with DDX1 occurred in clinical samples of neuroblastoma and whether such a finding carried any additional prognostic significance. We determined the gene copy number of DDX1 in 32 neuroblastoma patient samples (representative of all stages): 13 were MYCN amplified and 19 had normal copy numbers of the MYCN gene. Of the 13 neuroblastomas that were MYCN amplified, seven were also DDX1 amplified. Of the 19 that were not MYCN amplified, none were DDX1 amplified. This is the first example of a gene that is co-amplified with MYCN at a high frequency in neuroblastoma. While there was a trend towards a worse clinical outcome with co-amplification, the numbers were too small to reach significance."

The puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard-core injection addicts. Three long-term intravenous drug users, two males, one female, mean age 30.6 years (26-37) presented puffy hands. These patients had been drug addicts for four to twelve years (mean duration 7.3 years) and had stopped heroin injections for 3-5 years (mean 4.6), participating in a buprenorphine substitution program. The edema appeared several years after drug cessation (1.5-5, mean 2.3). Typically the puffiness was bilateral, the hands swollen from the proximal segments of the fingers to the wrist. In one patient, the edema was localized both in the hands and in the feet. The edema was not pitting and unaffected by elevation. Duplex ultrasound examination of the extremities was normal. Lymphangiography performed in one patient was consistent with deep lymphatic destruction. Puffy hand syndrome appears to be the end result of lymphatic obstruction. Repeated injections of drugs in or outside the veins destroy the lymphatics. Buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign. Although it is supposed to be administered orally, many drug addicts use it as an i.v. solution. Because buprenorphine is poorly soluble, it causes lymphatic obstruction. This type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires incision and drainage."

Heterophile antibody tests, including the Monospot test, are red cell or latex agglutination assays, which detect antired cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap and specific tests that can be performed from the onset of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. In adolescents, heterophile antibody tests have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of primary acute EBV infection. However, the tests have low sensitivity and low negative predictive value in young children and are not useful under the age of 4. Heterophile tests may be positive in other viral infections, autoimmune disease and haematological malignancies, but do not appear to be positive in primary bacterial infection. Virus-specific serology is required in children under the age of 4 or if an older child is heterophile negative. Virus-specific serology allows diagnosis and the pattern of positivity and negativity enables the clinician to stage the EBV infection. Virus-specific serology appears to have better sensitivity in young children, but there is cross-reaction with other herpesvirus infections, a longer turnaround time and it is more expensive to perform. Further research is needed to establish which children benefit from and hence require testing for heterophile antibodies, the cost-effectiveness of EBV investigations and whether heterophile titres have predictive value for the severity of infection and the likelihood of complications."

Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a mixture of polyclonal IgG antibodies isolated and pooled from thousands of healthy human donors. The scientific rationale for testing IVIG as a potential AD treatment include its natural anti-A\u03b2 antibody activity, its favorable safety profile and inherent anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory properties. Over the past decade, several clinical and pre-clinical experimental findings, advanced our knowledge about biological and therapeutic properties of IVIG that are relevant to AD therapy. Anti-amyloid antibodies in IVIG show significantly higher binding avidity for amyloid oligomers and fibrils than for A\u03b2 monomers. In a double transgenic murine model of AD, intracerebral injection of IVIG causes suppression of A\u03b2 fibril pathology whereas long term peripheral IVIG treatments causes elevation of total brain A\u03b2 levels with no measurable impact on A\u03b2 deposits or tendency for inducing cerebral microhemmorhage. Furthermore, chronic IVIG treatment suppressed neuroinflammation and fostered adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In clinical studies with AD patients, IVIG showed an acceptable safety profile and has not been reported to increase the incidence of amyloid related imaging abnormalities. Preliminary studies on small number of patients reported clinical benefits in mild to moderate stage AD patients. However, double blind, placebo controlled studies later did not replicate those initial findings. Interestingly though, in APOE4 carriers and in moderate disease stage subgroups, positive cognitive signals were reported. Nevertheless, both clinical and experimental (mouse) studies show that antibodies in IVIG can accumulate in CNS and its biological activities include neutralization of A\u03b2 oligomers, suppression of neuroinflammation and immunomodulation. Identifying mediators of IVIG's effects at the cellular and molecular level is warranted. In light of its favourable safety profile and aforementioned biological properties, IVIG is still an enigmatic experimental candidate with enormous potential for being an AD therapeutic. "

The first FK506 binding domain was shown sufficient to bind to both phosphatidylinositol-phosphate stereoisomers. GFP-tagged ROF1 under the control of a 35S promoter was localised in the cytoplasm and the cell periphery of Nicotiana tabacum leaf explants. Immunofluorescence microscopy of Arabidopsis thaliana root tips verified its cytoplasmic localization and membrane association and showed ROF1 localization in the elongation zone which was expanded to the meristematic zone in plants grown on high salt media. Endogenous ROF1 was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media (0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl) at both an mRNA and protein level. Plants over-expressing ROF1, (WSROF1OE), exhibited enhanced germination under salinity stress which was significantly reduced in the rof1(-) knock out mutants and abolished in the double mutants of ROF1 and of its interacting homologue ROF2 (WSrof1(-)/2(-)). Our results show that ROF1 plays an important role in the osmotic/salt stress responses of germinating Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and suggest its involvement in salinity stress responses through a phosphatidylinositol-phosphate related protein quality control pathway."

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03b2-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences. "

We have assessed the effects of NAP (davunetide), an eight-amino acid peptide that decreases tau hyperphosphorylation, in mice overexpressing wild-type human \u03b1-synuclein (Thy1-aSyn mice), a model that recapitulates aspects of PD. We found that the p-tau/tau level increased in a subcortical tissue block that includes the striatum and brain stem, and in the cerebellum of the Thy1-aSyn mice compared to nontransgenic controls. Intermittent intranasal NAP administration at 2 \u03bcg/mouse per day, 5 days a week, for 24 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, significantly decreased the ratio of p-tau/tau levels in the subcortical region while a higher dose of 15 \u03bcg/mouse per day induced a decrease in p-tau/tau levels in the cerebellum. Both NAP doses reduced hyperactivity, improved habituation to a novel environment, and reduced olfactory deficits in the Thy1-aSyn mice, but neither dose improved the severe deficits of motor coordination observed on the challenging beam and pole, contrasting with previous data obtained with continuous daily administration of the drug. The data reveal novel effects of NAP on brain p-tau/tau and behavioral outcomes in this model of synucleinopathy and suggest that sustained exposure to NAP may be necessary for maximal benefits. "

Familial Mediterranean fever type 1 is characterized by recurrent short episodes of inflammation and serositis, including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to renal failure, is the most severe complication. Familial Mediterranean fever type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation of familial Mediterranean fever in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Routine treatment of end-stage renal disease, including renal transplantation, is advised. Lifelong treatment with colchicine is required for homozygotes for the p.Met694Val mutation or compound heterozygotes for p.Met694Val and another disease-causing allele; this prevents the inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Individuals who do not have the p.Met694Val mutation and who are only mildly affected should be either treated with colchicine or monitored every 6 months for the presence of proteinuria. Molecular genetic testing of the MEFV gene, the only gene currently known to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever, can be offered to family members, especially when the p.Met694Val allele is present, because renal amyloidosis can be prevented by colchicine."

These scenarios are relevant, for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a circular molecular structure. A solution for these inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred multiple sequence alignment program."

Conditions were selected under which introduction of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici caused severe foot and root rot, whereas inoculation of the seed with P. fluorescens WCS365 decreased the percentage of diseased plants from 96 to 7%. This is a much better disease control level than was observed in potting soil. Analysis of root exudate revealed that the presence of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici did not alter the total amount of organic acids, but that the amount of citric acid decreased and that of succinic acid increased compared with the nontreated control. In contrast, in the presence of the P. fluorescens biocontrol strain WCS365, the total amount of organic acid increased, mainly due to a strong increase of the amount of citric acid, whereas the amount of succinic acid decreased dramatically. Under biocontrol conditions, when both microbes are present, the content of succinic acid decreased and the level of citric acid was similar to that in the nontreated control. The amount of sugar was approximately half that of the control sample when either one of the microbes was present alone or when both were present. Analysis of the interactions between the two microbes grown together in sterile tomato root exudate showed that WCS365 inhibited multiplication of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, whereas the fungus did not affect the number of CFU of the bacterium."

The results were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Detection of extraluminal air in the upright plain films and CT was analyzed by Z test. Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P<.05). CT detected extraluminal air in more cases than the upright plain films did (69% vs. 19%; Z=4.62>Z(0.01)=2.326).

The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral).

Here, we present a review of published papers in the last 3\u00a0years regarding this topic. The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed. "

However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb-Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of >50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously in vivo validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through in vivo validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations."

Likewise, we investigated whether pain thresholds or the appraisal of pain change after psychotherapy. We investigated 28 patients with BPD undergoing DBT (self-referral), 15 patients with treatment as usual and 23 healthy control subjects at two time points 12 weeks apart. We conducted an fMRI experiment eliciting negative emotions with picture stimuli and induced heat pain to investigate the role of pain in emotion regulation. Additionally, we assessed heat and cold pain thresholds.At first measurement, patients with BPD showed amygdala deactivation in response to painful stimulation, as well as altered connectivity between left amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These effects were reduced after DBT, as compared with patients with treatment as usual. Pain thresholds did not differ between the patient groups. We replicated the role of pain as a means of affect regulation in BPD, indicated by increased amygdala coupling. For the first time, we could demonstrate that pain-mediated affect regulation can be changed by DBT."

RNA primers and DNA synthesised by DNA polymerase \u03b1 are displaced by DNA polymerase \u03b4 to create bifurcated nucleic acid structures known as 5'-flaps. These 5'-flaps are removed by Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN), a structure-specific nuclease whose divalent metal ion-dependent phosphodiesterase activity cleaves 5'-flaps with exquisite specificity. FENs are paradigms for the 5' nuclease superfamily, whose members perform a wide variety of roles in nucleic acid metabolism using a similar nuclease core domain that displays common biochemical properties and structural features. A detailed review of FEN structure is undertaken to show how DNA substrate recognition occurs and how FEN achieves cleavage at a single phosphate diester. A proposed double nucleotide unpairing trap (DoNUT) is discussed with regards to FEN and has relevance to the wider 5' nuclease superfamily. The homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein (PCNA) coordinates the actions of DNA polymerase, FEN and DNA ligase by facilitating the hand-off intermediates between each protein during Okazaki fragment maturation to maximise through-put and minimise consequences of intermediates being released into the wider cellular environment. FEN has numerous partner proteins that modulate and control its action during DNA replication and is also controlled by several post-translational modification events, all acting in concert to maintain precise and appropriate cleavage of Okazaki fragment intermediates during DNA replication."

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients.

Clinical inflammatory signs, probe-to-bone test, and plain X-rays are postulated as the basic tests for clinical diagnosis when DFO is suspected. Diagnosis should be supported by laboratory tests, of which ESR (>70mm/h) has been shown to be most precise. MRI is the most accurate imaging test, especially for differential diagnosis with Charcot foot. Pathogen isolation by bone culture is essential when the patient is treated with ATB only.

Hyperflexion was the most common mechanism of injury, followed by pretibial trauma in the hyperflexed knee or in the \"dashboard\" injury. There were seven complete midsubstance tears and five partial tears. Direct visualization of the posterior cruciate ligament was not attained in one patient. All patients were treated nonoperatively on a physiotherapy routine. Average followup was 2.6 years. Patients were clinically examined and subjected to KT-1000 and Cybex testing. All patients were able to return to their previous activity and experienced no limitations with their injured knees. Using Hughston's criteria, subjective and functional ratings were all good. However, only 3 rated good and 10 fair when assessed objectively. We conclude that acceptable functional stability in these patients does not necessarily require absolute static stability.

Aims The Gore REDUCE Clinical Study (REDUCE) aims to establish superiority of patent foramen ovale closure in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing the risk of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke. Methods and design This controlled, open-label trial randomized 664 subjects with cryptogenic stroke at 63 multinational sites in a 2:1 ratio to either antiplatelet therapy plus patent foramen ovale closure (with GORE\u00ae HELEX\u00ae Septal Occluder or GORE\u00ae CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder) or antiplatelet therapy alone. Subjects will be prospectively followed for up to five years. Neuroimaging is required for all subjects at baseline and at two years or study exit. Study outcomes The two co-primary endpoints for the study are freedom from recurrent clinical ischemic stroke through at least 24 months post-randomization and incidence of new brain infarct (defined as clinical ischemic stroke or silent brain infarct) through 24 months. The primary analyses are an unadjusted log-rank test and a binomial test of subject-based proportions, respectively, both on the intent-to-treat population, with adjustment for testing multiplicity. Discussion The REDUCE trial aims to target a patient population with truly cryptogenic strokes. Medical therapy is limited to antiplatelet agents in both arms thereby reducing confounding. The trial should determine whether patent foramen ovale closure with the Gore septal occluders is safe and more effective than medical therapy alone for the prevention of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct; the neuroimaging data will provide an opportunity to further support the proof of concept. The main results are anticipated in 2017. Registration Clinical trial registration-URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00738894."

Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-A\u03b2 drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the \u03b2-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-A\u03b2 drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of A\u03b2 in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure."

By inhibiting the transporter protein SGLT2 in the kidneys, dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading to urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in blood glucose levels. Unlike oral antidiabetic drugs from several other classes, the efficacy of dapagliflozin is independent of insulin secretion and action. Therefore, when used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, dapagliflozin provides complementary therapy via its unique mechanism of action. A consistent finding across phase III, randomized, double-blind trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes was that dapagliflozin 5 or 10\u2009mg/day for 24 weeks as monotherapy in previously untreated patients, or as add-on combination therapy with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone or insulin-based therapy, significantly reduced both glycosylated haemoglobin values (primary endpoint) and fasting plasma glucose levels compared with placebo. Various randomized trials have also shown improvements in postprandial blood glucose with dapagliflozin monotherapy and combination therapy compared with placebo. In addition, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glipizide, in terms of glycaemic control after 52 weeks, when used as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately controlled with metformin. In most clinical trials, dapagliflozin was associated with reductions in body weight that were statistically superior to placebo or active comparators. Longer-term extension studies indicate that the efficacy of dapagliflozin is maintained for up to \u22482 years. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of 24 or 52 weeks duration and in extension studies of up to \u22482 years. Events suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract infections occurred more frequently among dapagliflozin than placebo recipients. These adverse events are of special interest because they appear to be related to the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia, especially when used alone or in combination with metformin, although the incidence of hypoglycaemic events reported with dapagliflozin in clinical trials varied depending on the background therapy. Longer-term tolerability/safety data with dapagliflozin are awaited with interest. In conclusion, dapagliflozin, with its unique and complementary mechanism of action, appears to be an important addition to the therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes, particularly when used as add-on therapy."

Definitive treatment of hypoglycaemia due to NICTH is by tumour resection. Our patient was a 78-year-old woman admitted after a fall with a facial injury and a history of significant weight loss. Her blood sugar was persistently low despite intravenous dextrose infusion. CT of the thorax revealed a large heterogeneous mass measuring 11.6\u00d716.3\u00d715.6\u2005cm in the right hemithorax. A biopsy of the mass was reported as a solitary fibrous tumour. Biochemical investigations revealed low insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1 and a high IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio, consistent with NICTH.

They play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological equilibrium of different biological niches and are essential for fermented food production and probiotic formulation. Despite the consensus about the 'health-promoting' significance of Lactobacillus genus, its genotypic and phenotypic characterization still poses several difficulties. The aim of this study was to assess the integration of different approaches, genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequencing), proteomic (MALDI-TOF MS) and metabolomic (1H-NMR), for the taxonomic and metabolic characterization of Lactobacillus species. For this purpose we analyzed 40 strains of various origin (intestinal, vaginal, food, probiotics), belonging to different species. The high discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF for species identification was underlined by the excellent agreement with the genotypic analysis. Indeed, MALDI-TOF allowed to correctly identify 39 out of 40 Lactobacillus strains at the species level, with an overall concordance of 97.5%. In the perspective to simplify the MALDI TOF sample preparation, especially for routine practice, we demonstrated the perfect agreement of the colony-picking from agar plates with the protein extraction protocol. 1H-NMR analysis, applied to both culture supernatants and bacterial lysates, identified a panel of metabolites whose variations in concentration were associated with the taxonomy, but also revealed a high intra-species variability that did not allow a species-level identification. Therefore, despite not suitable for mere taxonomic purposes, metabolomics can be useful to correlate particular biological activities with taxonomy and to understand the mechanisms related to the antimicrobial effect shown by some Lactobacillus species."

Studies have shown that the current treatments for AD, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI's) and NMDA receptor antagonists, have limited efficacy. The 5-HT-6 receptor antagonists Idalopirdine and Intepirdine have shown the most progress in current clinical trials and warrant consideration as emerging treatments for AD. Areas covered: This review discusses 5-HT6 antagonists currently in clinical trials as potential treatments for AD symptomatology and how 5-HT6 physiology may play a positive role in alleviating AD symptom pathophysiology. A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the terms Idalopirdine, Intepirdine, 5-HT-6 antagonist, and AD as keywords. Clinicaltrials.gov and Alzforum were also used to obtain information on clinical trials. Expert opinion: If current Phase-3 trials are positive, 5-HT6 antagonists such as Idalopirdine and Intepirdine may be considered as supplementary treatments to ChEI's and NMDA receptor antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of AD."

The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function.

Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1."

Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy."

They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10\u00a0years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy."

Within 5 min of suspending cells containing collapsed vesicles in growth medium, small transparent vesicles were detected. By 15 min the average number of vesicles per cell was 15. This number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle assembly. In addition, inhibition of protein or ribonucleic acid synthesis resulted in a loss of extant gas vesicles. Over the time course of our study, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was not required for gas vesicle assembly or stability."

This overview has indicated that A. americanum is involved in the ecology of several disease agents of humans and other animals, and the role of this tick as a vector of these diseases ranges from incidental to significant. Probably the clearest relationship is that of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and A. americanum. Also, there is a definite association between A. americanum and tularemia, as well as between the lone star tick and Theileria cervi to white-tailed deer. Evidence of Babesia cervi (= odocoilei) being transmitted to deer by A. americanum is largely circumstantial at this time. The role of A. americanum in cases of southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) is currently a subject of intensive investigations with important implications. The lone star tick has been historically reported to be a vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsiae, but current opinions are to the contrary. Evidence incriminated A. americanum as the vector of Bullis fever in the 1940s, but the disease apparently has disappeared. Q fever virus has been found in unfed A. americanum, but the vector potential, if any, is poorly understood at this time. Typhus fever and toxoplasmosis have been studied in the lone star tick, and several non-pathogenic organisms have been recovered. Implications of these tick-disease relationships are discussed."

However, the bacterium possesses mechanisms to resist and persist in this environment, in part by its ability to attach to and invade into the gallbladder epithelium. Such persistence in the gallbladder epithelium contributes to chronic carriage. In addition, patients harboring gallstones in their gallbladders have increased risk of becoming carriers because these abnormalities serve as a substrate for Salmonella biofilm formation. Our laboratory has studied the Salmonella interactions in this specific environment by developing in vitro methods that closely mimic the gallbladder and gallstones niches.

To investigate the hypothesis that the circadian oscillator of the cerebellum is involved in circadian physiology and food anticipation, we therefore by use of Cre-LoxP technology generated a conditional knockout mouse with the core clock gene Arntl deleted specifically in granule cells of the cerebellum, since expression of clock genes in the cerebellar cortex is mainly located in this cell type. We here report that deletion of Arntl heavily influences the molecular clock of the cerebellar cortex with significantly altered and arrhythmic expression of other central clock and clock-controlled genes. On the other hand, daily expression of clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was unaffected. Telemetric registrations in different light regimes did not detect significant differences in circadian rhythms of running activity and body temperature between Arntl conditional knockout mice and controls. Furthermore, food anticipatory behavior did not differ between genotypes.

The combination of cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF with the anti-GD2 MoAb ch14.18 (Dinutuximab) has shown a significant improvement in outcome for HR-NB. The FDA and EMA approved dinutuximab (Unituxin(R)) in 2015 for the treatment of patients with HR-NB who achieved at least a partial response after multimodality therapy. "

ChIP-exo allows identification of a nearly complete set of the binding locations of DNA-binding proteins at near-single-nucleotide resolution with almost no background. The process is initiated by cross-linking DNA and associated proteins. Chromatin is then isolated from nuclei and subjected to sonication. Subsequently, an antibody against the desired protein is used to immunoprecipitate specific DNA-protein complexes. ChIP DNA is purified, sequencing adaptors are ligated, and the adaptor-ligated DNA is then digested by lambda exonuclease, generating 25- to 50-nucleotide fragments for high-throughput sequencing. The sequences of the fragments are mapped back to the reference genome to determine the binding locations. The 5' ends of DNA fragments on the forward and reverse strands indicate the left and right boundaries of the DNA-protein binding regions, respectively."

It is thought that stalling of the mitochondrial replication machinery during DNA synthesis is a prominent source of mitochondrial genome instability; however, the precise molecular determinants of defective mitochondrial replication are not well understood. In this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the \"Pattern Finder\" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. We then used this information to map G4P sequences with deletions characteristic of representative mitochondrial genetic disorders and also those identified in various cancers and aging. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that mitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for the mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the mitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicase.

MafA was specifically downregulated in islets from Nrd1(del\u03b2) mice, whereas overexpression of NRDc upregulated MafA and insulin expression in INS832/13 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that NRDc is associated with Islet-1 in the enhancer region of MafA, where NRDc controls the recruitment of Islet-1 and MafA transcription.

The present study reports the results of a three-year TB surveillance among HCW in a large teaching hospital in Rome, using TST (by standard Mantoux technique) and IGRA (by QuantiFERON-TB) as first- and second-level screening tests, respectively. Out of 2290 HCW enrolled, 141 (6.1%) had a positive TST; among them, 99 (70.2%) underwent the IGRA and 16 tested positive (16.1%). The frequency of HCW tested positive for TB seems not far from other experiences in low incidence countries. Our results confirm the higher specificity of IGRA, but, due to its higher cost, TST can be considered a good first level screening test, whose positive results should be further confirmed by IGRA before the patients undergo X-ray diagnosis and/or chemotherapy."

The dog is typical of its genus, Canis, in its relatively unspecialized dentition, and a taste system that is rather insensitive to salt. The preference of many dogs for large infrequent meals reflects the competitive feeding behavior of its pack-hunting ancestor, the wolf Canis lupus. However, its long history of domestication, possibly 100,000 years, has resulted in great intraspecific diversity of conformation and behavior, including feeding. Morphologically and physiologically domestic cats are highly specialized carnivores, as indicated by their dentition, nutritional requirements, and sense of taste, which is insensitive to both salt and sugars. Their preference for several small meals each day reflects a daily pattern of multiple kills of small prey items in their ancestor, the solitary territorial predator Felis silvestris. Although in the wild much of their food selection behavior must focus on what to hunt, rather than what to eat, cats do modify their food preferences based on experience. For example, the \"monotony effect\" reduces the perceived palatability of foods that have recently formed a large proportion of the diet, in favor of foods with contrasting sensory characteristics, thereby tending to compensate for any incipient nutritional deficiencies. Food preferences in kittens during weaning are strongly influenced by those of their mother, but can change considerably during at least the first year of life."

Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of DBA families. Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause DBA by haploinsufficiency. However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism. To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an arginine residue is replaced with a tryptophan residue at codon 62 (RPS19R62W). Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal. Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in growth retardation, a mild anemia with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to DBA. RNA profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in RNA profiles of DBA patient cells. We conclude that RPS19R62W is a dominant negative DBA mutation."

However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located. Moreover, existing models do not account for the gene-specific roles of TF-binding sites, primarily because their roles often are not well understood. We introduce two models of regulatory sequence evolution that address some of the shortcomings of existing models and implement simulation frameworks based on them. One model simulates the evolution of an individual binding site in the context of a CRM, while the other evolves an entire CRM. Both models use a state-of-the art sequence-to-expression model to predict the effects of mutations on the regulatory output of the CRM and determine the strength of selection. We use the new framework to simulate the evolution of TF-binding sites in 37 well-studied CRMs belonging to the anterior-posterior patterning system in Drosophila embryos. We show that these simulations provide accurate fits to evolutionary data from 12 Drosophila genomes, which includes statistics of binding site conservation on relatively short evolutionary scales and site loss across larger divergence times. The new framework allows us, for the first time, to test hypotheses regarding the underlying cis-regulatory code by directly comparing the evolutionary implications of the hypothesis with the observed evolutionary dynamics of binding sites. Using this capability, we find that explicitly modeling self-cooperative DNA binding by the TF Caudal (CAD) provides significantly better fits than an otherwise identical evolutionary simulation that lacks this mechanistic aspect. This hypothesis is further supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of intersite spacing between adjacent CAD sites. Experimental tests confirm direct homodimeric interaction between CAD molecules as well as self-cooperative DNA binding by CAD. We note that computational modeling of the D. melanogaster CRMs alone did not yield significant evidence to support CAD self-cooperativity. We thus demonstrate how specific mechanistic details encoded in CRMs can be revealed by modeling their evolution and fitting such models to multispecies data. "

H19 knockdown in the myocardium of DCM rats attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved left ventricular structure and function. Adriamycin treatment was associated with elevated H19 and miR-675 expression and increased apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Enforced expression of miR-675 was found to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes with adriamycin treatment and H19-siRNA transfection. The 3'-untranslated region of PA2G4 was cloned downstream of a luciferase reporter construct and cotransfected into HEK293 cells with miR-675 mimic. The results of luciferase assay showed that PA2G4 was a direct target of miR-675. The expression of PA2G4 was reduced in cardiomyocytes transfected with miR-675 mimic. Moreover, H19 knockdown was found to increase PA2G4 expression and suppress apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin.

We engineered the BAC to replace the mouse coding region with the human MC1R sequence and used this in the transgenic assay. The human receptor also efficiently rescued Mc1r deficiency, and in addition, appeared to be completely resistant to the effects of agouti, suggesting agouti protein may not play a role in human pigmentary variation. Three human variant alleles account for 60% of all cases of red hair.

To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.

The C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol \u03b8 is important in the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol \u03b8 participates in a route of DSB repair termed \"alternative end-joining\" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex and requires DNA end resection. Pol \u03b8 is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. \"Signatures\" of Pol \u03b8 action during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining employs the ability of Pol \u03b8 to tightly grasp a 3' terminus through unique contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers. Pol \u03b8 is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a backup role in DNA base excision repair. POLQ is a member of a cluster of similarly upregulated genes that are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancer types. Inhibition of pol \u03b8 is a compelling approach for combination therapy of radiosensitization."

However, potential of the therapy for DMD at different stages of the disease progression is not understood. In this study, we examined the effect of peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO)-mediated exon skipping on disease progression of utrophin-dystrophin-deficient mice (dko) of four age groups (21-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50+ days), representing diseases from early stage to advanced stage with severe kyphosis. Biweekly intravenous (i.v.) administration of the PPMO restored the dystrophin expression in nearly 100% skeletal muscle fibers in all age groups. This was associated with the restoration of dystrophin-associated proteins including functional glycosylated dystroglycan and neuronal nitric synthase. However, therapeutic outcomes clearly depended on severity of the disease at the time the treatment started. The PPMO treatment alleviated the disease pathology and significantly prolonged the life span of the mice receiving treatment at younger age with mild phenotype. However, restoration of high levels of dystrophin expression failed to prevent disease progression to the mice receiving treatment when disease was already at advanced stage. The results could be critical for design of clinical trials with antisense therapy to DMD. "

Moreover, circRNAs' closed ring structure, insensitivity to RNase, and stability are advantages over linear RNAs in terms of development and application as a new kind of clinical marker. In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear. Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues. Discovery of sponge role of circRNAs caused researchers to more closely explore the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis and has significant clinical implications, and may open a new chapter in research on the pathology and treatment of cancers. This review summarizes the structure and function of circRNAs and provides evidence for the impact of ciRS-7 in promoting the development of cancer by acting as sponge of miR-7."

Both negative enrichment and recollection of isolated CTCs are required in the downstream analysis, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and massive equipment required. To solve these limitations, we have developed a simple and disposable spiral shape microfluidic channel that can separate all CTCs from blood cells, and at the same time, can identify the types of CTCs based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression level. Two different types of tumor cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both from the same origin of breast carcinoma cells, were used to demonstrate the functionality of the developed system. The spiral channel system could capture the EpCAM positive and negative CTCs with 96.3% and 81.2% purity, respectively, while both EpCAM positive and negative CTCs were differently positioned along the microfluidic channel. The average selectivity of EpCAM positive and negative CTCs is 6.1:4.8. In addition, the throughput of the system was optimized at a sample flow rate of 150\u00b5l/min. The developed system successfully demonstrated its potential to identify biomarkers, including EpCAM, for detecting the heterogenic CTCs."

EpCAM accumulated on the lateral interfaces of human colon carcinoma and normal intestinal epithelial cells but did not co-localize with TJ. Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased. Physical interactions between EpCAM and claudins were required for claudin stabilization. These findings suggest that EpCAM modulates adhesion and TJ function by regulating intracellular localization and degradation of selected claudins."

In order to test/reject ancient admixture from genome-wide data, we incorporate the model of genetic introgression into a statistical hypothesis-testing framework. We show that the power to reject ancient admixture increases as the ratio, at the time of putative admixture, of the population size of Homo sapiens over that of Neanderthal decreases. We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size."

MC1R variants were suggested to be associated with red hair, fair skin, and an increased risk of melanoma. We performed a meta-analysis on the association between the 9 most studied MC1R variants (p.V60L, p.D84E, p.V92M, p.R142H, p.R151C, p.I155T, p.R160W, p.R163Q and p.D294H) and melanoma and/or red hair, fair skin phenotype. Eleven studies on MC1R and melanoma, and 9 on MC1R and phenotype were included in the analysis. The 7 variants p.D84E, p.R142H, p.R151C, p.I155T, p.R160W, p. R163Q and p.D294H were significantly associated with melanoma development, with ORs (95%CI) ranging from 1.42 (1.09-1.85) for p.R163Q to 2.45 (1.32-4.55) for p.I155T. The MC1R variants p.R160W and p.D294H were associated both with red hair and fair skin, while p.D84E, p.R142H, and p.R151C were strongly associated with red hair only- ORs (95%CI) ranged from 2.99 (1.51-5.91) for p.D84E to 8.10 (5.82-11.28) for p.R151C. No association with melanoma or phenotype was found for p.V60L and p.V92M variants. In conclusion this meta-analysis provided evidence that some MC1R variants are associated both with melanoma and phenotype, while other are only associated with melanoma development. These results suggest that MC1R variants could play a role in melanoma development both via pigmentary and non-pigmentary pathways."

The current treatment which includes use of amphotericin B, antimonials, and others has major drawbacks due to toxicity, resistance, and extraordinary high cost. So there is an urgent need of development of new drug targets to fight against leishmaniasis. In this regard we have selected Leishmania donovani Ca2+ ion channel (Ld-CC) as potential drug target. Ld-CC regulates concentration of Ca2+ ions which is involved in several functions like flagellar motion, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and entry inside the macrophages. Since Ld-CC has not been characterised yet, we performed homology modelling of Leishmania donovani Ca2+ ion channel (Ld-CC) and docking studies of ligand library against this channel. 542 compound library of National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity 3 dataset selected for screening studies. The ligands ZINC17287336 and ZINC29590262 were selected as best energy conformers because they show highest binding affinity towards its target (Ld-CC). They interact with the active site residues in the pocket of Ld-CC which suggests that the docked conformations are good and acceptable. Moreover, these two selected compounds also have relatively high binding affinity than nifedipine and verapamil, known human calcium channel blockers which had been reported to have mild anti-leishmanial activity. Among these two top screened inhibitors the ligand ZINC29590262 shows poor binding affinity towards the Human voltagedependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1C in comparison to the Ld-CC. Therefore, we proposed this ligand as the best inhibitor which shows 40% more binding affinity with Ld-CC than the human-VDCC. These results suggest that our screened ligand ZINC29590262 could act as novel drug and may show much better antileishmanial activity."

The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. Because of linkage studies implicating 7q31 in autism, where language impairment is a component of the disorder, and in specific language impairment, FOXP2 has also been considered as a potential susceptibility locus for the language deficits in autism and/or specific language impairment. In this study, we characterized mice with a disruption in the murine Foxp2 gene. Disruption of both copies of the Foxp2 gene caused severe motor impairment, premature death, and an absence of ultrasonic vocalizations that are elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. Disruption of a single copy of the gene led to modest developmental delay but a significant alteration in ultrasonic vocalization in response to such separation. Learning and memory appear normal in the heterozygous animals. Cerebellar abnormalities were observed in mice with disruptions in Foxp2, with Purkinje cells particularly affected. Our findings support a role for Foxp2 in cerebellar development and in a developmental process that subsumes social communication functions in diverse organisms."

However, the approval of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shifted the treatment paradigm and provides hope for improved survival. The ability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evade the host immune system can be overcome by agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475/lambrolizumab), which is a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors). This remarkable efficacy lead to approval of pembrolizumab in the second-line setting as response rates were almost doubled compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Most recently, data in the first-line setting from the KEYNOTE-024 study have redefined the SOC therapy for a selected subset of patients. In patients with \u226550% PD-L1+ tumors, pembrolizumab had a clear progression-free survival and overall survival benefit. Toxicity was mostly immune related and similar to checkpoint blockade toxicities observed in previous studies. The initial approval and subsequent studies of pembrolizumab required and utilized a companion diagnostic test, Dako's IHC 22C3, to assess PD-L1 status of patients. The evaluation and scoring system of this assay has been used by other companies as a reference to develop their own assays, which may complicate selection of patients. Finally, the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous, ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy, chemoradiation, other immunotherapeutics, immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Further studies are also evaluating pembrolizumab in small-cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. This explosion of studies truly conveys the lack of therapeutic answers for lung cancer patients and the promise of pembrolizumab."

In line, mutant mice overexpressing Hand2 in otherwise healthy heart muscle cells developed a phenotype of pathological hypertrophy. Conversely, conditional gene-targeted Hand2 mice demonstrated a marked resistance to pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy, fibrosis, ventricular dysfunction and induction of a fetal gene program. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of miR-25 by a specific antagomir evoked spontaneous cardiac dysfunction and sensitized the murine myocardium to heart failure in a Hand2-dependent manner. Our results reveal that signalling cascades integrate with microRNAs to induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 in the postnatal mammalian myocardium with impact on embryonic gene programs in heart failure.

Employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) we have identified the nature and relative abundance of cerumen VOCs from 32 male donors. Our results show that cerumen contains a complex mixture of VOCs and that the amounts of these compounds vary across individuals as well as across ethnic/racial groups. In six of the seven compounds whose detected concentrations were found to be statistically different across groups, individuals of African descent (AfD) > Caucasian descent (CaD) > Asians descent (AsD). Our findings also reveal that ABCC11 genotype alone does not predict the type and relative levels of volatiles found in human cerumen, and suggest that other biochemical pathways must be involved. Examination of the composition and diversity of external auditory canal microbiota in a small subset of our subject population revealed that the ear microbiota may not be directly correlated with either ethnic group membership or ABCC11 genotype.

From all taxa identified, the relative abundance of the phylum Zygomycota, comprising the family Mucoraceae and genus Mucor, was negatively associated with cIMT and this association remained significant after controlling for false discovery rate. Obese subjects with detectable Mucor spp. had a similar cardiovascular risk profile as non-obese subjects. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Mucor racemosus was negatively associated both with FRS and cIMT. Partial least square discriminant analyses modelling, evaluating the potential relevance of gut mycobiota in patients stratified by mean values of cIMT, showed that even a 1 component model had a high accuracy (0.789), with a high R2 value (0.51). Variable importance in projection scores showed that M. racemosus abundance had the same impact in the model as waist-to-hip ratio, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting triglycerides or fasting glucose, suggesting that M. racemosus relative abundance in the gut may be a relevant biomarker for cardiovascular risk."

Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific fertilization in fish.

We have studied the evolution of adjacent gene pairs' identity, orientation, and spacing following whole-genome duplication and deletion (WGD-D) using comparative genomic analyses and simulations. Surveying adjacent gene organization across the Saccharomyces species complex, we find a genome-wide bias toward divergently and convergently transcribed gene pairs in all species but a reduction in this bias in the species that underwent WGD-D. Among neutral models of WGD-D, only single-gene deletion can produce the appropriate reduction in orientation bias and recapitulate the pattern of short, highly dispersed deletions we observe in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To characterize the dynamics of WGD-D, we trace the conservation and creation of adjacent gene pairs along the S. cerevisiae lineage. We find that newly created adjacencies have a tandem orientation bias, while adjacencies conserved from prior to WGD-D have the same divergent-convergent bias as found in the species that diverged before WGD. We also find that adjacent gene pairs produced by WGD-D gained greater intergenic spacing but that this is reduced in the older adjacencies. Given this, and the preponderance of short deleted blocks, we argue that the deletion phase of WGD-D occurred primarily by small inactivating mutations followed by numerous small deletions. Newly created adjacent gene pairs also have an initial increase in mean log2 expression ratios and maximal expression levels, suggesting that increased intergenic spacing caused a genome-wide reduction in transcriptional interference."

In the immunosuppressed population, the spectrum of potential oral disease is even broader, encompassing candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis, parotid gland enlargement, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral warts and other diseases. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to examine the oral microbiome of saliva, mucosal and tooth samples from HIV-positive and negative children. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from a cross-section of patients undergoing routine dental care. Multiple specimens from different sampling sites in the mouth were collected for each patient. The goal of the study was to observe the potential diversity of the oral microbiota among individual patients, sample locations, HIV status and various dental characteristics. We found that there were significant differences in the microbiome among the enrolled patients, and between sampling locations. The analysis was complicated by uneven enrollment in the patient cohorts, with only five HIV-negative patients enrolled in the study and by the rapid improvement in the health of HIV-infected children between the time the study was conceived and completed. The generally good oral health of the HIV-negative patients limited the number of dental plaque samples that could be collected. We did not identify significant differences between well-controlled HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative controls, suggesting that well-controlled HIV-positive patients essentially harbor similar oral flora compared to patients without HIV. Nor were significant differences in the oral microbiota identified between different teeth or with different dental characteristics. Additional studies are needed to better characterize the oral microbiome in children and those with poorly-controlled HIV infections. "

Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where \"ERRE\" represents \"Esrrb-responsive element\") of the promoter. Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells."

The enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO-2) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO-2) initiate the first step of the KP. IDO-1 and TDO-2 induction in tumors are crucial mechanisms implicated to play pivotal roles in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first comprehensive characterisation of the KP in 1) cultured human glioma cells and 2) plasma from patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Our data revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) stimulation significantly potentiated the expression of the KP enzymes, IDO-1 IDO-2, kynureninase (KYNU), kynurenine hydroxylase (KMO) and significantly down-regulated 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and kynurenine aminotransferase-I (KAT-I) expression in cultured human glioma cells. This significantly increased KP activity but significantly lowered the KYNA/KYN neuroprotective ratio in human cultured glioma cells. KP activation (KYN/TRP) was significantly higher, whereas the concentrations of the neuroreactive KP metabolites TRP, KYNA, QUIN and PIC and the KYNA/KYN ratio were significantly lower in GBM patient plasma (n = 18) compared to controls. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of the KP in glioma pathophysiology and highlight a potential role of KP products as novel and highly attractive therapeutic targets to evaluate for the treatment of brain tumors, aimed at restoring anti-tumor immunity and reducing the capacity for malignant cells to produce NAD(+), which is necessary for energy production and DNA repair."

Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer. DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we show an increased 5-hmC level in genomic DNA in CD4(+) T cells of patients with SLE compared with healthy controls, accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the Ten-eleven translocation TET2 and TET3, which can enzymatically convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls. We identified 2748 genes with increased 5-hmC levels in promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells, which were enriched in critical pathways, including neurotrophin signaling, WNT signaling, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling and the mTOR signaling pathway. Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA, which were also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.

ALX-0081 specifically inhibits platelet adhesion to the vessel wall, and may control platelet aggregation and subsequent clot formation without increasing bleeding risk. A substantial number of antithrombotics are aimed at this cascade; however, their generally indiscriminative mode of action can result in a narrow therapeutic window, defined by the risk for bleeding complications, and thrombotic events. Nonclinically, ALX-0081 compared favorably to several antithrombotics. In Phase I studies in healthy subjects and stable angina patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), ALX-0081 was well tolerated, and effectively inhibited pharmacodynamic markers. Following these results, a phase II study was initiated in high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing PCI. Based on its mechanism of action, ALX-0081 is also being developed for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura."

The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments."

We attempted to determine the expression patterns for a random sample of the annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect."

Weighted TFBS contributions to putative gene regulation are integrated to derive an NF-\u03baB gene network. A de novo motif enrichment analysis uncovers secondary TFBSs (AP1, SP1) at characteristic distances from NF-\u03baB/RelA TFBSs. Comparison with experimental ENCODE ChIP-Seq data indicates that experimental TFBSs highly correlate with predicted sites. We observe that RelA-SP1-enriched promoters have distinct expression profiles from that of RelA-AP1 and are enriched in introns, CpG islands and DNase accessible sites. Sixteen novel NF-\u03baB/RelA-regulated genes and TFBSs were experimentally validated, including TANK, a negative feedback gene whose expression is NF-\u03baB/RelA dependent and requires a functional interaction with the AP1 TFBSs. Our probabilistic method yields more accurate NF-\u03baB/RelA-regulated networks than a traditional, distance-based approach, confirmed by both analysis of gene expression and increased informativity of Genome Ontology annotations. Our analysis provides new insights into how co-occurring TFBSs and local chromatin context orchestrate activation of NF-\u03baB/RelA sub-pathways differing in biological function and temporal expression patterns.

However, NK cell function has been shown to be potentially diminished by factors common in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we assessed the synergistic potential of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and killer immunoglobin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand mismatched NK cells to potentiate NK cell antitumor reactivity in multiple myeloma (MM). Hypoxia, lactate, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or combinations were selected to mimic the TME. To investigate this, NK cells from healthy donors were isolated and NK cell ADCC capacity in response to MM cells was assessed in flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity and degranulation (CD107a) assays in the presence of TME factors. Hypoxia, lactate and PGE2 reduced cytotoxicity of NK cells against myeloma target cells. The addition of daratumumab (anti-CD38 antibody) augmented NK-cell cytotoxicity against target cells expressing high CD38, but not against CD38 low or negative target cells also in the presence of TME. Co-staining for inhibitory KIRs and NKG2A demonstrated that daratumumab enhanced degranulation of all NK cell subsets. Nevertheless, KIR-ligand mismatched NK cells were slightly better effector cells than KIR-ligand matched NK cells. In summary, our study shows that combination therapy using strategies to maximize activating NK cell signaling by triggering ADCC in combination with an approach to minimize inhibitory signaling through a selection of KIR-ligand mismatched donors, can help to overcome the NK-suppressive TME. This can serve as a platform to improve the clinical efficacy of NK cells."

Although GO shows a narrow therapeutic window in early clinical studies, recent reports detailing a modified dosing regimen of GO can be safely combined with induction chemotherapy, and the combination provides significant survival benefits in AML patients. Here we tested whether the survival benefits seen with the combination arise from the enhanced reduction of chemoresidual disease and leukemic initiating cells (LICs). Herein, we use cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML models to evaluate the combination of GO with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) induction chemotherapy on AML blast growth and animal survival. DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117- and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone. These data suggest that the survival benefit seen by the combination of GO and induction chemotherapy, nonclinically and clinically, may be attributed to the enhanced reduction of LICs."

The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals. These findings strongly predict a cellular adhesion function for TMEM132 family, connecting the extracellular medium with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton."

Direct functional restoration of p53 as a transcription factor has been difficult to achieve in the clinic. We performed a functional screen using a bioluminescence-based transcriptional read-out to identify small molecules that restore the p53 pathway in mutant p53-bearing cancer cells. We identified CB002, as a candidate that restores p53 function in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells and without toxicity to normal human fibroblasts. Cells exposed to CB002 show increased expression of endogenous p53 target genes NOXA, DR5, and p21 and cell death which occurs by 16\u00a0hours, as measured by cleaved caspases or PARP. Stable knockdown of NOXA completely abrogates PARP cleavage and reduces sub-G1 content, implicating NOXA as the key mediator of cell death induction by CB002. Moreover, CB002 decreases the stability of mutant p53 in RXF393 cancer cells and an exogenously expressed R175H p53 mutant in HCT116 p53-null cells. R175H p53 expression was rescued by addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 to CB002, suggesting a role for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the mutant protein. In summary, CB002, a p53 pathway-restoring compound that targets mutant p53 for degradation and induces tumor cell death through NOXA, may be further developed as a cancer therapeutic."

Glaucoma can strike without symptoms and causes blindness if it remains without treatment. Therefore, early disease detection is important so that treatment can be initiated and blindness prevented. In this context, important advances in technology for non-invasive imaging of the eye have been made providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, an essential element for glaucoma detection and monitoring. 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), an optical imaging technique, has been commonly used to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy subjects. In this paper, we present a new framework for detection of glaucoma progression using 3D SD-OCT images. In contrast to previous works that the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurement provided by commercially available spectral-domain optical coherence tomograph, we consider the whole 3D volume for change detection. To integrate a priori knowledge and in particular the spatial voxel dependency in the change detection map, we propose the use of the Markov Random Field to handle a such dependency. To accommodate the presence of false positive detection, the estimated change detection map is then used to classify a 3D SDOCT image into the \"non-progressing\" and \"progressing\" glaucoma classes, based on a fuzzy logic classifier. We compared the diagnostic performance of the proposed framework to existing methods of progression detection."

We describe the development and implementation of a bioinformatics algorithm, copy number variation-random forest (CNV-RF), that incorporates a machine learning component to identify CNVs from targeted NGS data. Using CNV-RF, we identified 12 of 13 deletions in samples with known CNVs, two cases with duplications, and identified novel deletions in 22 additional cases. Furthermore, no CNVs were identified among 60 genes in 14 cases with normal copy number and no CNVs were identified in another 104 patients with clinical suspicion of CNVs. All positive deletions and duplications were confirmed using a quantitative PCR method. CNV-RF also detected heterozygous deletions and duplications with a specificity of 50% across 4813 genes. The ability of CNV-RF to detect clinically relevant CNVs with a high degree of sensitivity along with confirmation using a low-cost quantitative PCR method provides a framework for providing comprehensive NGS-based CNV/single-nucleotide variant detection in a clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory."

This concept has already been established with oncogenic gene fusions like BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in lung cancer, including special tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which are able to block the activation of the depending downstream proliferation pathways and, consequently, tumor growth.

Several TRK inhibitors have been developed, and one of them, Larotrectinib (formerly known as LOXO-101), represents an orally available, selective inhibitor of the TRK receptor family that has already shown substantial clinical benefit in both pediatric and adult patients harboring an NTRK gene fusion over the last few years."

Previous studies have reported a broad range of secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here, we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59 ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization."

Fecal microbiota transplantation's success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with fecal microbiota transplantation as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Results from clinical trials that use fecal microbiota transplantation to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most fecal microbiota transplantation donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent fecal microbiota transplantation clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict [Formula: see text] statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to [Formula: see text]. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to [Formula: see text]. We use the results of similar simulations to make recommendations about the number of patients, the number of donors, and the choice of clinical endpoint that clinical trials should use to optimize their ability to detect if fecal microbiota transplantation is effective for treating a condition."

Luckily, the recent development of single-cell genomics biotechnologies enables the screening and collection of the somatic mutations, especial single nucleotide variations (SNVs), occurring in normal cells. Here, we established DSMNC: a database of somatic mutations in normal cells (http://dsmnc.big.ac.cn/), which provides most comprehensive catalogue of somatic SNVs in single cells from various normal tissues. In the current version, the database collected \u223c0.8 million SNVs accumulated in \u223c600 single normal cells (579 human cells and 39 mouse cells). The database interface supports the user-friendly capability of browsing and searching the SNVs and their annotation information. DSMNC, which serves as a timely and valuable collection of somatic mutations in individual normal cells, has made it possible to analyze the burdens and signatures of somatic mutations in various types of heterogeneous normal cells. Therefore, DSMNC will significantly improve our understanding of the characteristics of somatic mutations in normal cells."

Cholera toxin (CT), which is secreted by V. cholerae, can enter host cells by binding to GM1, a monosialoganglioside widely distributed on the plasma membrane surface of various animal epithelial cells. The present study was undertaken to generate peptides that are conformationally similar to the carbohydrate epitope of GM1 for use in the treatment of cholera and related bacterial infection. For this purpose, we used cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit to select CTB-binding peptides that structurally mimic GM1 from a dodecamer phage-display library. Six GM1-replica peptides were selected by biopanning based on CTB recognition. Five of the six peptides showed inhibitory activity for GM1 binding to CTB. To test the potential of employing the peptide mimics for intervening with the bacterial infection, those peptides were examined for their binding capacity, functional inhibitory activity and in vitro effects using a human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco-2 cells. One of the peptides, P3 (IPQVWRDWFKLP), was most effective in inhibiting cellular uptake of CTB and suppressing CT-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in the cells. Our results thus provide convincing evidence that GM1-replica peptides could serve as novel agents to block CTB binding on epithelial cells and prevent the ensuing physiological effects of CT. "

Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients."

Here we present Telomerecat, a novel approach to the estimation of telomere length. Previous methods have been dependent on the number of telomeres present in a cell being known, which may be problematic when analysing aneuploid cancer data and non-human samples. Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons. We also apply the method to a cancer cell data, uncovering an interesting relationship with the underlying telomerase genotype."

The data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial is a valuable source of data to study biomarker screening for HCC. We assume the trajectories of AFP and DCP follow a joint hierarchical mixture model with random changepoints that allows for distinct changepoint times and subsequent trajectories of each biomarker. The changepoint indicators are jointly modeled with a Markov Random Field distribution to help detect borderline changepoints. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to calculate posterior distributions, which are used in risk calculations among future patients and determine whether a patient has a positive screen. The screening algorithm was compared to alternatives in simulations studies under a range of possible scenarios and in the HALT-C Trial using cross-validation."

In TNF-alpha-activated FL5.12 cells, tBID becomes part of a 45-kDa cross-linkable mitochondrial complex. Here we describe the biochemical purification of this complex and the identification of mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (Mtch2) as part of this complex. Mtch2 is a conserved protein that is similar to members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family. Our studies with mouse liver mitochondria indicate that Mtch2 is an integral membrane protein exposed on the surface of mitochondria. Using blue-native gel electrophoresis we revealed that in viable FL5.12 cells Mtch2 resides in a protein complex of ca. 185 kDa and that the addition of TNF-alpha to these cells leads to the recruitment of tBID and BAX to this complex. Importantly, this recruitment was partially inhibited in FL5.12 cells stably expressing BCL-X(L). These results implicate Mtch2 as a mitochondrial target of tBID and raise the possibility that the Mtch2-resident complex participates in the mitochondrial apoptotic program."

The first patient presented with left hemiparesis mimicking stroke and the second patient presented with neurological symptoms without fever, which was indistinguishable from brain tumor. In both cases, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed to differentiate infectious processes from other causes. Diagnosis was made with a positive blood culture in both cases. Listerial DNA was detected in the pus aspirated from the abscess in the first case. Both patients were successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin followed by oral amoxicillin.

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, apixaban recipients were significantly less likely than warfarin recipients to experience stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding or death; the beneficial effects of treatment with apixaban versus warfarin were generally maintained across various patient subgroups. Apixaban recipients also had a significantly lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage than warfarin recipients. In the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients who have Failed or are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Therapy) trial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable, apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than aspirin, without an increase in the risk of major bleeding. In conclusion, although longer-term efficacy and safety data are needed, apixaban is an important new option for use in patients with nonvalvular AF to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism."

Classic features include biparietal foramina, multiple exostoses, profound hypotonia, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Fewer than 40 individuals with PSS have been reported, with variable clinical presentations due in part to disparity in deletion sizes. We report on a boy who presented for initial evaluation at age 13 months because of a history of developmental delay, hypotonia, subtle dysmorphic features, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. SNP microarray analysis identified a 137\u2009kb deletion at 11p11.2, which maps within the classically defined PSS interval. This deletion results in haploinsufficiency for all or portions of six OMIM genes: SLC35C1, CRY2, MAPK8IP1, PEX16, GYLTL1B, and PHF21A. Recently, translocations interrupting PHF21A have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies similar to those seen in PSS. The identification of this small deletion in a child with developmental delay and hypotonia provides further evidence for the genetic basis of developmental disability and identifies a critical region sufficient to cause hypotonia in this syndrome. Additionally, this case illustrates the utility of high resolution genomic approaches in correlating clinical phenotypes with specific genes in contiguous gene deletion syndromes."

Here, we used vaspin treated 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes as well as 3T3-L1 cells with stable vaspin expression to investigate the effect of exogenous and endogenous vaspin on inflammatory processes and insulin signaling in adipocytes. Our stably transfected cells secreted significant amounts of vaspin which was in the physiological range of \u223c0.5\u00a0ng/ml in cell supernatants. Adipocyte differentiation was not affected by vaspin as expression of adipogenic marker genes as well as lipid accumulation after full differentiation was similar to control cells. We found that IL-1\u03b2 induced expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, MCP1 and TNF\u03b1 was significantly blunted in vaspin expressing 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with exogenous vaspin resulted in reduced cytokine-induced activation of the intracellular and pro-inflammatory NF\u03baB signaling cascades (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, I\u03baB and NF\u03baB). Moreover, endogenous vaspin positively affected insulin signaling by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the key mediator protein kinase B (AKT). Together, we demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of vaspin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as increased insulin signaling by endogenous expression or exogenous treatment. The results provide evidence for potent anti-inflammatory action of vaspin not only in vascular cells but also in adipose tissue."

In contrast, little is known about channel structure and subcellular distribution. We therefore determine the subcellular localization of Panx1 channels in cultured cells and aim at the identification of channel morphology in vitro. Using freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling on EYFP-Panx1-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, large particles were identified in plasma membranes, which were immunogold-labeled using either GFP or Panx1 antibodies. There was no labeling or particles in the nuclear membranes of these cells, pointing to plasma membrane localization of Panx1-EYFP channels. The assembly of particles was irregular, this being in contrast to the regular pattern of gap junctions. The fact that no counterparts were identified on apposing cells, which would have been indicative of intercellular signaling, supported the idea of Panx1 channels within one membrane. Control cells (transfected with EYFP only, non-transfected) were devoid of both particles and immunogold labeling. Altogether, this study provides the first demonstration of Panx1 channel morphology and assembly in intact cells. The identification of Panx1 channels as large particles within the plasma membrane provides the knowledge required to enable recognition of Panx1 channels in tissues in future studies. Thus, these results open up new avenues for the detailed analysis of the subcellular localization of Panx1 and of its nearest neighbors such as purinergic receptors in vivo. "

Mutations in the corresponding genes have been directly associated with severe human cardiac and skeletal myopathies, and aberrant expression patterns have often been observed in affected muscles. Herein, we have investigated whether MLP and CFL2 are involved in common molecular mechanisms, which would promote our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We have shown for the first time, using a range of biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, that MLP binds directly to CFL2 in human cardiac and skeletal muscles. The interaction involves the inter-LIM domain, amino acids 94 to 105, of MLP and the amino-terminal domain, amino acids 1 to 105, of CFL2, which includes part of the actin depolymerization domain. The MLP/CFL2 complex is stronger in moderately acidic (pH 6.8) environments and upon CFL2 phosphorylation, while it is independent of Ca(2+) levels. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease."

Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic \"tone\" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for \"GABAergic\" ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention."

Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability. Histopathological analysis showed that COG112 and COG133 attenuated demyelination and significantly diminished the number of peripheral cells infiltrating into the spinal cord. ApoE mimetics also interfered with several mechanisms relevant to the pathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis, including activation of macrophages, subsequent production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte proliferation. These data suggest that apoE mimetics represent a multidimensional therapeutic for multiple sclerosis capable of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade, modulating immune cell function, and reducing clinical signs, which may have novel utility for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases."

Besides, continuously increasing interest in assessing the role of the plant active constituents preventing the risk of cancer was a reason to make a detailed examination of the investigated ethanol, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and N-butanol extracts regarding cytotoxicity. Oral administration of the investigated extracts caused a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in a model of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Gastroprotective activity of the extracts was investigated using an ethanol-induced acute stress ulcer in rats. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was assessed on PBMC, B16, and HL-60 cells and compared to the cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds identified in extracts. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death were analyzed by double staining with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI.

All investigated extracts produced dose-dependent gastroprotective activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug ranitidine. The diethyl ether extract showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity on B16 cells and HL-60 cells, decreasing cell growth to 51.3 % and 77.5 % of control, respectively, when used at 100 \u00b5g/mL. It seems that phenolic compounds (apigenin, luteolin, and their corresponding glycosides) are responsible for the diethyl ether extract cytotoxic effect. It also appears that induction of oxidative stress might be involved in its cytotoxicity, since B16 and HL-60 cells increased their ROS production in response to treatment with diethyl ether extract. Neither of the tested extracts nor any phenolic compounds showed significant cytotoxic effect to human PBMC. These results demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activities, as well as the promising cytotoxicity."

In the current study, gamabufotalin (GBT) was isolated from toad venom, and its tumor-specific cytotoxicity was investigated in human MM cells. We found GBT inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis with the IC50 values <50 nM. Mechanistic studies using functional approaches identified GBT as an inhibitor of c-Myc. Further analysis showed that GBT especially evoked the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc protein, thereby globally repressing the expression of c-Myc target genes. GBT treatment inhibited ERK and AKT signals, while stimulating the activation of JNK cascade. An E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, WWP2, was upregulated following JNK activation and played an important role in c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation through direct protein-protein interaction. The antitumor effect of GBT was validated in a xenograft mouse model and the suppression of MM-induced osteolysis was verified in a SCID-hu model in vivo. Taken together, our study identified the potential of GBT as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of MM. "

Mitosomes are the simplest and the least well-studied type of anaerobic mitochondria. Transport of proteins via TIM complexes, composed of three proteins of the Tim17 protein family (Tim17/22/23), is one of the key unifying aspects of mitochondria and mitochondria-derived organelles. However, multiple experimental and bioinformatic attempts have so far failed to identify the nature of TIM in mitosomes of the anaerobic metamonad protist, Giardia intestinalis, one of the few experimental models for mitosome biology. Here, we present the identification of a single G. intestinalis Tim17 protein (GiTim17), made possible only by the implementation of a metamonad-specific hidden Markov model. While very divergent in primary sequence and in predicted membrane topology, experimental data suggest that GiTim17 is an inner membrane mitosomal protein, forming a disulphide-linked dimer. We suggest that the peculiar GiTim17 sequence reflects adaptation to the unusual, detergent resistant, inner mitosomal membrane. Specific pull-down experiments indicate interaction of GiTim17 with mitosomal Tim44, the tethering component of the import motor complex. Analysis of TIM complexes across eukaryote diversity suggests that a \"single Tim\" translocase is a convergent adaptation of mitosomes in anaerobic protists, with Tim22 and Tim17 (but not Tim23), providing the protein backbone."

At the time of the writing of this article, there are two CAR T cells available, Kymriah, produced by Novrtis with a price tag of US$475,000 and Yescarta produced by Gilead Pharmaceuticals with a price tag of US$373,000, neither price including the required hospital admission in order to administer the agent in addition to potential treatment of side effects. There are several issues that are imperative to recognize when understanding the high cost, however the two more pertinent issues are low availability of the agent and no billing code. While only approved for less than a year, there are thoughts about how to bring the price down with more approved CAR T cells and more center with the ability to administer this therapy, however results may be years away before they are realized. In the short term, insurance companies are grappling over how to pay for CAR T therapy, with one of the biggest voids concerning the absence of a billing code for CAR T cells. Regardless, its high price tag highlights moral issues underlying value-based payments and whether the treatment is worth the cost while evaluating the juxtaposition of life years and monetary values. As CAR T cells expand the boundaries of immunotherapy with extraordinary results, the need for a lower price in combination for more availability of CAR T cells will grow until some of these fundamental issues are addressed."

While there are a number of drugs approved for its treatment, drug resistance has compromised most of them, making the development of new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria essential. The completion of the Plasmodium falciparum genome and a growing understanding of parasite biology are fueling the search for novel drug targets. Despite this, few targets have been chemically validated in vivo. The pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway illustrates one of the best examples of successful identification of anti-malarial drug targets. This review focuses on recent studies to exploit the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of P. falciparum, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), as a new target for drug discovery. Several chemical scaffolds have been identified by high throughput screening as potent inhibitors of PfDHODH and these show strong selectivity for the malarial enzyme over that from the human host. Potent activity against parasites in whole cell models with good correlation between activity on the enzyme and the parasite have also been observed for a number of the identified series. Lead optimization of a triazolopyrimidine-based series has identified an analog with prolonged plasma exposure, that is orally bioavailable, and which shows good efficacy against the in vivo mouse model of the disease. These data provide strong evidence that PfDHODH is a validated target for the identification of new antimalarial chemotherapy. The challenge remains to identify compounds with the necessary combination of potency and metabolic stability to allow identification of a clinical candidate."

We found that cultured epididymal epithelial cells isolated from rat epididymides expressed high levels of CK-19 but barely expressed vimentin. Gain-of-function assays, which included the CCK-8 assay and EdU flow cytometry assay, indicated that overexpression of OCTN2 significantly promoted epididymal epithelial cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, forced expression of OCTN2 inhibited the cell apoptosis process, and at the same time increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factor BAX, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptosis factors BCL-2 and Survivin. Furthermore, we also found that OCTN2 overexpression dramatically increased the levels of biomarkers associated with spermatogenesis, including azoospermia-like (DAZL), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), and protamine 2 (PRM2). These results demonstrate that OCTN2 plays a positive role in epididymal epithelial cells, and might be useful in the clinical treatment of male infertility by serving as a key regulatory factor."

Adapted from studies in twitcher mice, GLD dogs were treated by combination intravenous and intracerebroventricular injections of AAVrh10 to target both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Combination of intravenous and intracerebroventricular AAV gene therapy had a clear dose response and resulted in delayed onset of clinical signs, extended life-span, correction of biochemical defects, and attenuation of neuropathology.

CFL2 encodes the protein cofilin-2, which plays an important role in regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments.

In this study, CD44\u2009+\u2009CD24- fraction sorting with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter and mammosphere culture were used for enriching BCSCs. We report here that Nanog was highly expressed in CSCs-enriched population from the breast cancer cells, as well as stemness-associated genes. In addition, we employed the lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting Nanog to investigate function of Nanog in BCSCs. We found that targeted inhibition of Nanog could suppress proliferation and colony formation in breast cancer cells. Further studies showed that targeted inhibition of Nanog resulted in a decrease of BCSCs activities, including mammosphere formation, CD44\u2009+\u2009CD24- proportion and expressions of stemness-associated genes.

To enable analysis of the human surfaceome, we developed the surfaceome predictor SURFY, based on machine learning. As a training set, we used experimentally verified high-confidence cell-surface proteins from the Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) and trained a random forest classifier on 131 features per protein and, specifically, per topological domain. SURFY was used to predict a human surfaceome of 2,886 proteins with an accuracy of 93.5%, which shows excellent overlap with known cell-surface protein classes (i.e., receptors). In deposited mRNA data, we found that between 543 and 1,100 surfaceome genes were expressed in cancer cell lines and maximally 1,700 surfaceome genes were expressed in embryonic stem cells and derivative lines. Thus, the surfaceome diversity depends on cell type and appears to be more dynamic than the nonsurface proteome. To make the predicted surfaceome readily accessible to the research community, we provide visualization tools for intuitive interrogation (wlab.ethz.ch/surfaceome).

In this study, we have evaluated possible functional expression of different osseous genes in the brain. In embryonic and adult mouse brains, mRNA expression was invariably seen for the master regulator of osteoblastic differentiation Runt related factor-2 (Runx2), in addition to the partner protein core binding factor-beta and their targets such as osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13), but not for collagen-I or osteocalcin. In pluripotent P19 progenitor cells, Runx2 mRNA expression was drastically increased along with mRNA expression of an astrocytic marker, but not with neuronal marker mRNA expression. Both mRNA and corresponding protein were detected for Runx2 in cultured rat neocortical astrocytes and astrocytic C6 glioma cells. In C6 glioma cells, transient overexpression of Runx2 significantly increased mRNA expression of MMP13, but not of OPN. Moreover, transient overexpression of Runx2 significantly increased luciferase activity in C6 glioma cells transfected with the reporter plasmid linked to a wild-type Runx2 binding element in the MMP13 promoter, but not in cells with a mutated element. These results suggest that Runx2 signal input may lead to transactivation of MMP13 gene without affecting OPN expression in astrocytes."

Patisiran has been developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; it was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) in adults and subsequently approved in the EU for the treatment of hATTR in adults with stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy. The recommended dosage, administered as a single intravenous infusion over approximately 80\u00a0min, is 0.3\u00a0mg/kg once every 3\u00a0weeks for patients weighing <\u2009100\u00a0kg and 30\u00a0mg once every 3\u00a0weeks for patients weighing\u00a0\u2265\u2009100\u00a0kg.

How their epithelial features, such as apicobasal polarity or adhesion, are maintained and remodelled and how adhesion and polarity proteins contribute to morphogenesis are two important questions in development. Here, we approach these issues by investigating the role of the apical determinant protein Crumbs (Crb) during the morphogenesis of the embryonic Drosophila tracheal system. Crb accumulates differentially throughout tracheal development and is required for different tracheal events. The earliest requirement for Crb is for tracheal invagination, which is preceded by an enhanced accumulation of Crb in the invagination domain. There, Crb, acting in parallel with the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway, is required for tracheal cell apical constriction and for organising an actomyosin complex, which we propose is mediated by Crb recruitment of moesin (Moe). The ability of a Crb isoform unable to rescue polarity in crb mutants to otherwise rescue their invagination phenotype, and the converse inability of a FERM-binding domain mutant Crb to rescue faulty invagination, support our hypothesis that it is the absence of Crb-dependent Moe enrichment, and not the polarity defect, that mainly underlies the crb invagination phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotype of lethal giant larvae (lgl); crb double mutants. These results unveil a link between Crb and the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis."

Additionally, SAMHD1 functions as a restriction factor for retroviruses, such as HIV. Here, we review the current biochemical and biological properties of the enzyme including its structure, activity, and regulation by post-translational modifications in the context of its cellular function. We outline open questions regarding the biology of SAMHD1 whose answers will be important for understanding its function as a regulator of cell cycle progression, genomic integrity, and in autoimmunity."

AIRE controls the local transcription of organ- specific proteins typically expressed in peripheral tissues, thus allowing the negative selection of self- reactive T cells. The crucial role played by AIRE in central immune tolerance emerged in the studies on the pathogenesis of Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy, a rare inherited polyendocrine/autoimmune disease. Thereafter, several studies found evidences indicating that AIRE impairment might be pathogenically involved in several autoimmune diseases and in tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on recent advances relative to AIRE's effect on T cell development in physiology and disease. In particular, we address the following issues: 1) AIRE function and mTECs biology, 2) the impact of AIRE gene mutations in autoimmune diseases, and 3) the role of AIRE gene in anti-tumor immune response."
