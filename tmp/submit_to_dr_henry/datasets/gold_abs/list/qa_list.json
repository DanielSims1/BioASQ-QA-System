However, the potential pharmacogenetic role of other EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) has not been elucidated. We studied 74 KRAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR plus irinotecan. Twenty-two genetic variants in EGFR, EGF, AREG and EREG genes were selected using HapMap database and literature resources. Three tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the AREG gene region (rs11942466 C>A, rs13104811 A>G, and rs9996584 C>T) predicted disease control in the multivariate analyses. AREG rs11942466 C>A and rs9996584 C>T were also associated with overall survival (OS). The functional polymorphism, EGFR rs712829 G>T, was associated with progression-free and OS. Our findings support that intergenic polymorphisms in the AREG gene region might help to identify colorectal cancer patients that will benefit from irinotecan plus anti-EGFR therapy. "

Current guidelines and recommendations for MG treatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying treatments. This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine. Despite a lack of data from well controlled clinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine is the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG. Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy. Novel AChE inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and preliminary results appear to be promising. In general, however, AChE inhibitors provide only partial benefit and most patients eventually switch to long-term immunosuppressive therapies, most frequently corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. Although AChE inhibitors are known to be well tolerated and effective in relieving the symptoms of MG, further efforts are required to improve treatment options for the management of this disorder."

Wnt signaling activates the gene encoding DVL-1; the latter suppresses beta-catenin by promoting its degradation through enhanced inactivation of glycogen-synthase-kinase 3 (GSK3). Here we demonstrate increased expression of DVL-1 mRNA in over two thirds of primary cervical squamous cell cancers (11 of 15 cases) when compared to corresponding non-cancerous uterine squamous cell tissues. In addition, we noted up-regulation of cyclin D1, a downstream effector of Wnt signal pathway in cervical cancer. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that DVL-1 protein was prominent in the cytoplasm of cancer cells whereas it was unreactive in the surrounding normal cervical squamous cells. These data indicate that amplification and increased expression of the DVL-1 gene may play some role in the development of a portion of human cervical squamous cell cancer through derangement of the Wnt signaling pathway."

These agents have a very significant toxicity, and while they are being used less, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) does significantly increase the safety with which they can be administered. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. These are generally safe agents which do not normally require TDM. Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone. TDM can be useful in the case of amiodarone to monitor compliance and toxicity but is generally of little value for sotalol. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem. These are normally monitored by haemodynamic effects, rather than using TDM. Other agents which do not fall neatly into the Vaughan Williams classification include digoxin and perhexiline. TDM is very useful for monitoring the administration (and particularly the safety) of both of these agents."

Previous studies show that NOTCH3 protein forms multimers. Here, we investigate protein interactions between NOTCH3 and other vascular Notch isoforms and characterize the effects of elevated NOTCH3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate that NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. R90C and C49Y mutant NOTCH3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild type NOTCH3 complexes. Using quantitative NOTCH3-luciferase clearance assays, we found significant inhibition of mutant NOTCH3 clearance. In coculture assays of NOTCH function, overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 significantly repressed NOTCH-regulated smooth muscle transcripts and potently impaired the activity of three independent smooth muscle promoters. Wildtype and R90C recombinant NOTCH3 proteins applied to cell cultures also blocked canonical Notch fuction. We conclude that CADASIL mutants of NOTCH3 complex with NOTCH1, 3, and 4, slow NOTCH3 clearance, and that overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 protein interfere with key NOTCH-mediated functions in smooth muscle cells."

It is now possible to explore the fundamental cellular mechanisms underlying human aging, clarifying the role played by replicative senescence. By implication, we may soon be able to determine the extent to which the major causes of death and disability in aging populations in developed countries-cancer, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, macular degeneration, and Alzheimer dementia--are attributable to such fundamental mechanisms. If they are amenable to prevention or treatment by alteration of cellular senescence, the clinical implications have few historic precedents."

Structural information about most of these important proteins is very sparse. Our bioinformatics analysis herein reveals that these reprogramming factors and most of the efficiency-improving and embryonic stem cell markers are highly enriched in intrinsic disorder. As is typical for transcription factors, these proteins are modular. Specific sites for interaction with other proteins and DNA are dispersed in the long regions of intrinsic disorder. These highly dynamic interaction sites are evidently responsible for the delicate interplay among various molecules. The bioinformatics analysis given herein should facilitate the investigation of the roles and organization of these modular interaction sites, thereby helping to shed further light on the pathways that underlie the mechanism(s) by which terminally differentiated cells are converted to iPS cells."

Due to the clinical heterogeneity, time-dependent evolution of symptoms, overlapping phenotypes, and inconsistencies in muscle pathology findings, definitive diagnosis relies on the molecular finding of deleterious mutations. We sequenced the exons and flanking intron region from approximately 350 patients displaying a phenotype consistent with POLG related mitochondrial disease and found informative mutations in 61 (17%). Two mutant alleles were identified in 31 unrelated index patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders. Among them, 20 (67%) had Alpers syndrome, 4 (13%) had arPEO, and 3 (10%) had ANS. In addition, 30 patients carrying one altered POLG allele were found. A total of 25 novel alterations were identified, including 6 null mutations. We describe the predicted structural/functional and clinical importance of the previously unreported missense variants and discuss their likelihood of being pathogenic. In conclusion, sequence analysis allows the identification of mutations responsible for POLG-related disorders and, in most of the autosomal recessive cases where two mutant alleles are found in trans, finding deleterious mutations can provide an unequivocal diagnosis of the disease."

Since 1989, there has been an exponential increase in AEDs with 23 currently licensed for clinical use, and recently, there has been renewed and extensive interest in the use of saliva as an alternative matrix for AED TDM. The advantages of saliva include the fact that for many AEDs it reflects the free (pharmacologically active) concentration in serum; it is readily sampled, can be sampled repetitively, and sampling is noninvasive; does not require the expertise of a phlebotomist; and is preferred by many patients, particularly children and the elderly. For each AED, this review summarizes the key pharmacokinetic characteristics relevant to the practice of TDM, discusses the use of other biological matrices with particular emphasis on saliva and the evidence that saliva concentration reflects those in serum. Also discussed are the indications for salivary AED TDM, the key factors to consider when saliva sampling is to be undertaken, and finally, a practical protocol is described so as to enable AED TDM to be applied optimally and effectively in the clinical setting. Overall, there is compelling evidence that salivary TDM can be usefully applied so as to optimize the treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine, clobazam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and zonisamide.

Further, the kinase activity of both TGFbeta receptors appears to play a role in the TGFbeta-mediated phosphorylation of km23, although TGFbeta RII kinase activity is absolutely required for km23 phosphorylation. Blockade of km23 using small interfering RNAs significantly decreased key TGFbeta responses, including induction of fibronectin expression and inhibition of cell growth.

However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.

All of these R-loops arise upon generation of a G-rich RNA strand by an RNA polymerase upon transcription of a C-rich DNA template strand. These R-loops are of significant length. For example, the R-loop at the col E1 origin of replication appears to be about 140 bp. Our own lab has focused on class switch regions, where the R-loops can extend well over a kilobase in length. Here, methods are described for detection and analysis of R-loops in vitro and in vivo."

P., Parvatiyar, M. S., Pinto, J. R., Marquardt, M. L., Bos, J. M., Tester, D. J., Ommen, S. R., Potter, J. D., and Ackerman, M. J. (2008) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 45, 281-288). We performed actomyosin ATPase and spectroscopic solution studies to investigate the molecular properties of these mutations. Actomyosin ATPase activity was measured as a function of [Ca(2+)] utilizing reconstituted thin filaments (TFs) with 50% mutant and 50% wild type (WT) and 100% mutant cardiac troponin (cTn) complexes: A8V, C84Y, and D145E increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity with only A8V demonstrating lowered Ca(2+) sensitization at the 50% ratio when compared with 100%; E134D was the same as WT at both ratios. Of these four mutants, only D145E showed increased ATPase activation in the presence of Ca(2+). None of the mutants affected ATPase inhibition or the binding of cTn to the TF measured by co-sedimentation. Only D145E increased the Ca(2+) affinity of site II measured by 2-(4'-(2''-iodoacetamido)phenyl)aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid fluorescence in isolated cTnC or the cTn complex. In the presence of the TF, only A8V was further sensitized to Ca(2+). Circular dichroism measurements in different metal-bound states of the isolated cTnCs showed changes in the secondary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E, whereas E134D was the same as WT. PyMol modeling of each cTnC mutant within the cTn complex revealed potential for local changes in the tertiary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E. Our results indicate that 1) three of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cTnC mutants increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament; 2) the effects of the mutations on the Ca(2+) affinity of isolated cTnC, cTn, and TF are not sufficient to explain the large Ca(2+) sensitivity changes seen in reconstituted and fiber assays; and 3) changes in the secondary structure of the cTnC mutants may contribute to modified protein-protein interactions along the sarcomere lattice disrupting the coupling between the cross-bridge and Ca(2+) binding to cTnC."

Here, we show that H3-Lys9 methylation also occurs in facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in female mammals. H3-Lys9 methylation is retained through mitosis, indicating that it might provide an epigenetic imprint for the maintenance of the inactive state. Disruption of the two mouse Suv39h HMTases abolishes H3-Lys9 methylation of constitutive heterochromatin but not that of the Xi. In addition, HP1 proteins, which normally associate with heterochromatin, do not accumulate with the Xi. These observations suggest the existence of an Suv39h-HP1-independent pathway regulating H3-Lys9 methylation of facultative heterochromatin."

Real-time PCR demonstrated an increased mRNA expression of PRKAR1A/PKAI, whereas protein kinase A regulatory subunit 2 beta (PRKAR2B/PKAII) was downregulated in human CCA tissues and CCA cell lines. Immunohistochemistry of human CCA tissues revealed increased PRKAR1A with decreased PRKAR2B protein expression. Moreover, CCA cell lines showed abundantly expressed PRKAR1A, while lacking PRKAR2B expression. Silencing PRKAR1A expression induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of CCA cells, with an associated decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway signaling. The inhibition of PKA using a PKA inhibitor and cAMP analogs also led to a significant cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, our study reports the overexpression as well as molecular mechanisms by which PRKAR1A/PKA regulates human CCA cell growth. Importantly, abrogation of gene expression caused significant CCA cell growth inhibition, oncogenic signaling and coupled apoptosis induction, suggesting PRKAR1A's potential as a drug target for CCA therapy."

Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors. In vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction of Bacillus megaterium KM demonstrated that mersacidin did not prevent the synthesis of lipid II [undecaprenyl-diphosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-(pentapeptide)-N-ac ety lglucosamine] but specifically the subsequent conversion of this intermediate into polymeric nascent glycan strands by transglycosylation. Comparison with other inhibitors of transglycosylation shows that the effective concentration of mersacidin in vitro is in the range of that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin but 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the competitive enzyme inhibitor moenomycin. The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. This indicates that the molecular target site of mersacidin differs from that of vancomycin and that no cross-resistance exists between the two antibiotics."

The hair shafts are extremely brittle, and they show alternating light and dark banding when examined microscopically between polarizing filters. Other features of this syndrome are low birth weight, short stature, mental retardation, delayed neuromuscular development and other CNS anomalies, dysplasia of nails, hypoplasia of subcutaneous fatty tissue, prematurely aged facial appearance, hypogonadism, cataracts, osteosclerosis, dysphonia, and increased susceptibility to infections.

Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis MSCs were isolated from patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, and cultured in vitro for 2-5 passages.

Expression of mRNA and protein was determined by RT-PCR and flow cytomery. Co-culture with both rheumatoid arthritis MSCs and osteoarthritis MSCs significantly enhanced B-cell survival, the effect being more prominent in rheumatoid arthritis MSCs. Both types of MSCs displayed expression of B cell-activating factor mRNA and protein. Blocking B cell-activating factor signalling from MSCs by specific anti-B cell-activating factor and anti-B cell-activating factor receptor antibodies weakly reversed the effect of MSCs on B-cell survival mainly in rheumatoid arthritis MSCs. MSC interaction with B cells provides stimuli for B-cell survival and therefore may contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. MSC-derived factors other than B cell-activating factor are likely to contribute to this effect. This feature is more prominent in rheumatoid arthritis MSCs, possibly due to the B cell-activating factor."

However, this could expose the patient to an arrhythmia; - a clear proof that the suspension of amiodarone can allow restoring normalization of the thyroid function doesn't exist. Therefore, the patient has been successfully submitted to the surgical intervention and in the follow-up we brought her back to a state of normalized thyroid function and cardiovascular conditions. In patients that cannot safely discontinue amiodarone or when medical therapy is ineffective in controlling thyrotoxicosis, thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice."

EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS/FLI targets are also regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined transcriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference knockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS/FLI target gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4 promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma whose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those with lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the cancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for GGAA-microsatellites in EWS/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data also suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central oncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene."

The methylation mutations caused only partial demethylation of the PAI loci: ddm1 had a strong effect on the singlet genes but a weaker effect on the inverted repeat, whereas met1 had a stronger effect on the inverted repeat than on the singlet genes. The double ddm1 met1 mutant also displayed partial demethylation of the PAI genes, with a pattern similar to the ddm1 single mutant. To determine the relationship between partial methylation and expression for the singlet PAI2 gene we constructed a novel reporter strain of Arabidopsis in which PAI2 silencing could be monitored by a blue fluorescent plant phenotype diagnostic of tryptophan pathway defects. This reporter strain revealed that intermediate levels of methylation correlate with intermediate suppression of the fluorescent phenotype."

CHD7 is a chromodomain-containing, ATP dependent helicase protein that is highly expressed in the developing ear and is required for semicircular canal development in both humans and mice. Here we report that mice with heterozygous loss of Chd7 function exhibit delayed semicircular canal genesis, delayed Netrin1 expression and disrupted expression of genes that are critical for semicircular canal formation (Bmp2, Bmp4, Msx1 and Fgf10). Complete loss of Chd7 results in aplasia of the semicircular canals and sensory vestibular organs, with reduced or absent expression of Otx1, Hmx3, Jagged1, Lmo4, Msx1 and Sox2. Our results suggest that Chd7 may have critical selector gene functions during inner ear morphogenesis. Detailed analysis of the epigenetic modifications underlying these gene expression changes should provide insights into semicircular canal development and help in the design of therapies for individuals with inner ear malformations."

The proportions of carbohydrate, fat, and protein must be optimized to provide enough calories to sustain the energy requirements of competition or training, and for recovery. In addition, endurance athletes must include adequate vitamins and minerals in their diets to maintain healthy immune function. Vitamins and minerals may be sufficient in the diets of endurance athletes, who have a high energy intake. This would make it unnecessary to use vitamin and mineral supplements. Furthermore, one major limitation for these athletes is the management of oxidative stress, which, when in excess, can be deleterious for the organism. For individuals exposed to oxidative stress, micronutritional supplementations rich in vitamins and minerals can be also an alternative strategy. Although these supplementations are increasingly used by master athletes, very few data are available on their effects on oxidative stress, muscle recovery, and physical performance. The potential benefits of supplement use in athletes are thus questionable. Some studies indicate no benefits, while others highlight potential negative side effects of vitamin supplementation. Additional studies are warranted in order to design adapted prescriptions in antioxidant vitamins and minerals."

Next, we systematically examined association between C. trachomatis and various endocytic pathway markers. Spinning disk confocal time-lapse studies revealed significant and rapid association between C. trachomatis with Rab7 and LAMP1, markers of late endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor of lysosome acidification led to significant increases in C. trachomatis growth in macrophages. At later stages of infection, C. trachomatis associated with the autophagy marker LC3. TEM analysis confirmed that a significant portion of C. trachomatis resided within double-membrane-bound compartments, characteristic of autophagosomes. Together, these results suggest that macrophages can suppress C. trachomatis growth by targeting it rapidly to lysosomes; moreover, autophagy is activated at later stages of infection and targets significant numbers of the invading bacteria, which may enhance subsequent chlamydial antigen presentation."

The association of different histone modifications with euchromatic and heterochromatic compartments is relatively conserved in highly divergent model organisms such as Drosophila and mammals. However, some differences between these model systems have been uncovered while limited data are available from organisms nearer the invertebrate-vertebrate transition. We identified a chromatin compartment in both diploid and endocycling cells of the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, enriched in heterochromatic histone modifications and DNA methylation. Surprisingly, this compartment also contained high levels of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3 Me(3)K4), a modification thus far associated with actively transcribed sequences. Although in Drosophila and mouse cells, H3 Me(3)K4 was prevalently associated with euchromatin, we also detected it in their pericentromeric heterochromatin. We further showed that H3 Me(3)K4 abundance was not necessarily proportional to local levels of transcriptional activity in either euchromatin or heterochromatin. Our data indicate greater plasticity across evolution in the association of histone lysine methylation with functionally distinct chromatin domains than previously thought and suggest that H3 Me(3)K4 participates in additional processes beyond marking transcriptionally active chromatin."

Ectopic expression of TRIM67 results in degradation of endogenous 80K-H and attenuation of cell proliferation and enhances neuritogenesis in the neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115. Furthermore, morphological and biological changes caused by knockdown of 80K-H are similar to those observed by overexpression of TRIM67. These findings suggest that TRIM67 regulates Ras signaling via degradation of 80K-H, leading to neural differentiation including neuritogenesis."

We show that PSP1 interacts in vivo with a subset of the total cellular pool of p54nrb. We map the domain within PSP1 that is mediating this interaction and show it is required for the correct localization of PSP1 to paraspeckles. This interaction is necessary but not sufficient for paraspeckle targeting by PSP1, which also requires an RRM capable of RNA binding. Blocking the reinitiation of RNA Pol II transcription at the end of mitosis with DRB prevents paraspeckle formation, which recommences after removal of DRB, indicating that paraspeckle formation is dependent on RNA Polymerase II transcription. Thus paraspeckles are the sites where a subset of the total cellular pool of p54nrb is targeted in a RNA Polymerase II-dependent manner."

Still, the mechanism underlying tetramerization--the necessary step for the formation of functional receptors that can be inserted into the plasma membrane--is unknown. All eukaryotic compared to prokaryotic iGluR subunits have an additional transmembrane segment, the M4 segment, which positions the physiologically critical C-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits lacking M4 do not express on the plasma membrane. Here, we show that these constructs are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, the major cellular compartment mediating protein oligomerization. Using approaches to assay the native oligomeric state of AMPAR subunits, we find that subunits lacking M4 or containing single amino acid substitutions along an \"interacting\" face of the M4 helix that block surface expression no longer tetramerize in either homomeric or heteromeric assemblies. In contrast, subunit dimerization appears to be largely intact. These experiments define the M4 segment as a unique functional unit in AMPARs that is required for the critical dimer-to-tetramer transition."

The aim of this study was to identify causative mutations in genes involved in Ca(2+) regulation in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu). These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population. In conclusion, mutations in Ca(2+) handling genes are an infrequent but important cause of FHC. DNA variants in Ca(2+) genes may also be involved as modifying factors in phenotype development. Further evaluation of the role of defects in Ca(2+) regulation will shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of FHC."

In this study, we show that exploiting ChIP-information in a query-based way makes in silico CRM detection a much more feasible endeavor. To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method 'CPModule'. By applying it on a well-studied ChIP-Seq data set involved in self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate how our tool can recover combinatorial regulation of five known TFs that are key in the self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells. Additionally, we make a number of new predictions on combinatorial regulation of these five key TFs with other TFs documented in TRANSFAC."

In this study, we show that miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17. Consequently, blockade of VEGF-A activity using soluble VEGF receptor 1 resulted in significantly lower levels of corneal miR-132 after HSV infection. In addition, low levels of corneal miR-132 were detected in IL-17 receptor knockout mice after HSV infection. In vivo silencing of miR-132 by the provision of anti-miR-132 (antagomir-132) nanoparticles to HSV-infected mice led to reduced corneal neovascularization and diminished SK lesions. The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease.

As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST). Brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia was significantly reduced in GFAP-GRK2(+/-) mice, which have a 60% reduction in astrocyte GRK2 compared to GFAP-WT littermates. In addition, GRK2-deficient astrocytes have higher plasma-membrane levels of GLAST and an increased capacity to take up glutamate in vitro. In search for the mechanism by which GRK2 regulates GLAST expression, we observed increased GFAP levels in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. GFAP and the cytoskeletal protein ezrin are known regulators of GLAST localization. In line with this evidence, GRK2-deficiency reduced phosphorylation of the GRK2 substrate ezrin and enforced plasma-membrane GLAST association after stimulation with the group I mGluR-agonist DHPG. When ezrin was silenced, the enhanced plasma-membrane GLAST association in DHPG-exposed GRK2-deficient astrocytes was prevented. In conclusion, we identified a novel role of astrocyte GRK2 in regulating plasma-membrane GLAST localization via an ezrin-dependent route. We demonstrate that the 60% reduction in astrocyte GRK2 protein level that is observed in GFAP-GRK2(+/-) mice is sufficient to significantly reduce neonatal ischemic brain damage. These findings underline the critical role of GRK2 regulation in astrocytes for dampening the extent of brain damage after ischemia."

To date, no systematic characterization of Coomassie Blue infrared fluorescence detection relative to detection with SR has been reported. Here, seven commercial Coomassie stain reagents and seven stain formulations described in the literature were systematically compared. The selectivity, threshold sensitivity, inter-protein variability, and linear-dynamic range of Coomassie Blue infrared fluorescence detection were assessed in parallel with Sypro Ruby. Notably, several of the Coomassie stain formulations provided infrared fluorescence detection sensitivity to <1 ng of protein in-gel, slightly exceeding the performance of Sypro Ruby. The linear dynamic range of Coomassie Blue infrared fluorescence detection was found to significantly exceed that of Sypro Ruby. However, in two-dimensional gel analyses, because of a blunted fluorescence response, Sypro Ruby was able to detect a few additional protein spots, amounting to 0.6% of the detected proteome. Thus, although both detection methods have their advantages and disadvantages, differences between the two appear to be small. Coomassie Blue infrared fluorescence detection is thus a viable alternative for gel-based proteomics, offering detection comparable to Sypro Ruby, and more reliable quantitative assessments, but at a fraction of the cost.

Because of the absence of identified targets and targeted therapies, and due to a heterogeneous molecular presentation, treatment guidelines for patients with TNBC include only conventional chemotherapy. Such treatment, while effective for some, leaves others with high rates of early relapse and is not curative for any patient with metastatic disease. Here, we demonstrate that these tumors are sensitive to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor PU-H71. Potent and durable anti-tumor effects in TNBC xenografts, including complete response and tumor regression, without toxicity to the host are achieved with this agent. Notably, TNBC tumors respond to retreatment with PU-H71 for several cycles extending for over 5 months without evidence of resistance or toxicity. Through a proteomics approach, we show that multiple oncoproteins involved in tumor proliferation, survival, and invasive potential are in complex with PU-H71-bound Hsp90 in TNBC. PU-H71 induces efficient and sustained downregulation and inactivation, both in vitro and in vivo, of these proteins. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G(2)-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-kappaB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential. The results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC."

They bind the genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures. These 3D chromatin structures involve the interactions between PcG-bound regulatory regions at short- and long-range distances, and may significantly contribute to PcG function. Recent high throughput \"Chromosome Conformation Capture\" (3C) analyses have revealed many other higher order structures along the chromatin fiber, partitioning the genomes into well demarcated topological domains.

Minor phosphorylation sites affected by either CK2 or CK1 are Ser120/Ser121 and Ser174, respectively. A synthetic peptide of 25 amino acids encompassing residues 67-93 of I-2 is phosphorylated by either CK2 or CK1 at its seryl residue corresponding to Ser86 with higher Vmax and Km values similar to those of the intact protein (9 vs 7.2 microM and 14.2 vs 5.3 microM with CK2 and CK1, respectively). No detectable phosphorylation of this peptide which also includes the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) site (Thr72), could be observed with either GSK-3 or p34cdc2 kinase whether or not its seryl residue equivalent to Ser86 had been previously phosphorylated by CK2. Shorter derivatives of I-2(67-93), encompassing residues 72-93 and 78-93, are also readily phosphorylated by both CK1 and CK2, with phosphorylation efficiencies similar to those of the parent peptide. A synthetic heptadecapeptide reproducing the phosphoacceptor site around Ser120/Ser121 is phosphorylated by CK2, but not to any detectable extent by CK1, with a Km value fivefold higher than that of the corresponding pentadecapeptide including Ser86 (78-93). A synthetic pentadecapeptide (166-180) reproducing the phosphoacceptor site around Ser174 is phosphorylated by CK1 less efficiently than the pentadecapeptide including its main phosphorylation site (78-93) (Km 280 microM vs 33 microM). This peptide is readily phosphorylated by CK2 as well, although it lacks the canonical consensus sequence for CK2 and its Ser174 is almost unaffected by CK2 in intact I-2. These data provide the clear-cut demonstration that the consensus sequence with N-terminal prephosphorylated residue(s), SerP/ThrP-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr, [Flotow, H., Graves, P. R., Wang, A., Fiol, C.

They also show that the specificity determinants for I-2 phosphorylation by either CK2 or CK1, but not by GSK3, are entirely grounded on local structural features of the phosphoacceptor site, being only marginally affected by the overall structure of I-2."

The precise mechanisms by which ATGL action is regulated by lipid droplet (LD) coat proteins and responds to hormonal stimulation are incompletely defined. By combining usage of loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we sought to determine the respective roles of perilipin 1 and fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27) in the control of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes. Knockdown of endogenous perilipin 1 expression resulted in elevated basal lipolysis that was less responsive to \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. In comparison, depletion of FSP27 protein increased both basal and stimulated lipolysis with no significant impact on the overall response of cells to isoproterenol. In vitro assays showed that perilipin but not FSP27 was able to inhibit the triacylglycerol hydrolase activity of ATGL. Perilipin 1 also attenuated dose-dependent activation of ATGL by its Coactivator Comparative Gene identification-58. Accordingly, depletion of perilipin 1 and CGI-58 in adipocytes inversely affected basal lipolysis specifically mediated by overexpressed ATGL. Moreover, although depletion of perilipin 1 abolished the LD translocation of ATGL stimulated by isoproterenol, absence of FSP27 resulted in multilocularization of LDs along with increased LD presence of ATGL under both basal and stimulated conditions. Interestingly, knockdown of ATGL expression increased LD size and decreased LD number in FSP27-depeleted cells. Together, our results demonstrate that although FSP27 acts to constitutively limit the LD presence of ATGL, perilipin 1 plays an essential role in mediating the response of ATGL action to \u03b2-adrenergic hormones."

This response proves advantageous in the short-term to restrain iron availability to pathogens, but ultimately leads to severe anemia, and impairs the response to erythropoietin (Epo) and iron. Homozygosity for the common C282Y and H63D HFE polymorphisms influence iron metabolism by hampering hepcidin release by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores, thereby resulting in inadequate inhibition of the activity of Ferroportin-1, inappropriately high iron absorption and recycling, and iron overload. However, in hemodialysis patients, carriage of HFE mutations may confer an adaptive benefit by decreasing hepcidin release in response to iron infusion and inflammation, thereby improving iron availability to erythropoiesis, anemia control, the response to Epo, and possibly survival. Therefore, anti-hepcidin therapies may improve anemia management in hemodialysis. However, HFE mutations directly favor hemoglobinization independently of hepcidin, and reduce macrophages activation in response to inflammation, whereas hepcidin might also play a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-microbic action during sepsis, so that direct inhibition of HFE-mediated regulation of iron metabolism may represent a valuable alternative therapeutic target. Genetic studies may offer a valuable tool to test these hypotheses and guide the research of new therapies. "

This modified scale would provide many of the same advantages as the original, such as interrater reliability, simplicity, and elimination of the verbal component that is not compatible with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), creating a more valuable neurological assessment tool for the nursing community. Our goal was to potentially provide greater information than the formally used GCS when assessing critically ill, neurologically impaired patients, including those sedated and/or intubated. Experienced pediatric intensive care unit nurses were trained as \"expert raters.\" Two different nurses assessed each subject using the Pediatric FOUR Score Scale (PFSS), GCS, and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale at three different time points. Data were compared with the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) assessed by another nurse. Our hypothesis was that the PFSS and PCPC should highly correlate and the GCS and PCPC should correlate lower. Study results show that the PFSS is excellent for interrater reliability for trained nurse-rater pairs and prediction of poor outcome and in-hospital mortality, under various situations, but there were no statistically significant differences between the PFSS and the GCS. However, the PFSS does have the potential to provide greater neurological assessment in the intubated and/or sedated patient based on the outcomes of our study. "

In the last few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth, excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia.

Recent studies suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in oncogenic Ras-induced premature senescence. However, the signaling mechanism controlling this oxidant-mediated irreversible growth arrest is not fully understood. Here, we show that through the Ras/MEK pathway, Ras oncogene up-regulated the expression of superoxide-generating oxidases, Nox1 in rat REF52 cells and Nox4 in primary human lung TIG-3 cells, leading to an increase in intracellular level of ROS. Ablation of Nox1 and Nox4 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocked the RasV12 senescent phenotype including \u03b2-galactosidase activity, growth arrest and accumulation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and p16Ink4a. This suggests that Nox-generated ROS transduce senescence signals by activating the p53 and p16Ink4a pathway. Furthermore, Nox1 and Nox4 siRNAs inhibited both Ras-induced DNA damage response and p38MAPK activation, whereas overexpression of Nox1 and Nox4 alone was able to induce senescence. The involvement of Nox1 in Ras-induced senescence was also confirmed with embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nox1 knockout mice. Together, these findings suggest that Nox1- and Nox4-generated ROS play an important role in Ras-induced premature senescence, which may involve DNA damage response and p38MAPK signaling pathways."

Dynamic and precise control of YAP/TAZ activity is thus important to ensure proper physiological regulation and homeostasis of the cells. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ activation results in activation of their negative regulators, LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2) kinases, to constitute a negative feedback loop of the Hippo pathway in both cultured cells and mouse tissues. YAP/TAZ in complex with the transcription factor TEAD (TEA domain family member) directly induce LATS2 expression. Furthermore, YAP/TAZ also stimulate the kinase activity of LATS1/2 through inducing NF2 (neurofibromin 2). This feedback regulation is responsible for the transient activation of YAP upon lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation and the inhibition of YAP-induced cell migration. Thus, this LATS-mediated feedback loop provides an efficient mechanism to establish the robustness and homeostasis of YAP/TAZ regulation. "

There is a morphological trait of the myocardial structure with a spectrum from normal variants to the pathological phenotype of LVNC, which reflects the embryogenic structure of the human heart due to an arrest in the compaction process during the first trimester. It must be cautioned not to overdiagnose LVNC: the morphological spectrum of trabeculations, from normal variants to pathological trabeculations with the morphological feature of LVNC must be carefully considered. The classical triad of complications are heart failure, arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death, and systemic embolic events. Non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium can occur in isolation or in association with congenital heart defects (CHDs), genetic syndromes, and neuromuscular disorders among others. The clinical spectrum is wide and the outcome is more favourable than in previously described populations with a negative selection bias. Familial occurrence is frequent with autosomal dominant and X-linked transmissions. Different mutations in sarcomere protein genes were identified and there seems to be a shared molecular aetiology of different cardiomyopathic phenotypes, including LVNC, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Thus, genetic heterogeneity, with an overlap of different phenotypes, and the variability of hereditary patterns, raise the questions whether there is a morphological trait from dilated/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to LVNC and what are the triggers and modifiers to develop either dilated, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or LVNC in patients with the same mutation. The variety in clinical presentation, the genetic heterogeneity, and the phenotype of the first transgenetic animal model of an LVNC-associated mutation question the hypothesis that LVNC be a distinct cardiomyopathy: it seems to be rather a distinct phenotype or phenotypic, morphological expression of different underlying diseases than a distinct cardiomyopathy."

Single heterozygous mutations have been detected repeatedly both in a subset of patients and in unaffected individuals, and the significance of these mutations has long been debated. Several neurophysiological studies from non-manifesting PINK1 heterozygotes have demonstrated the existence of neural plasticity abnormalities, indicating the presence of specific endophenotypic traits in the heterozygous state. We performed a functional analysis of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in heterozygous PINK1 knockout (PINK1(+/-) ) mice using a multidisciplinary approach and observed that, despite normal motor behavior, repetitive activation of cortical inputs to striatal neurons failed to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas long-term depression was normal. Although nigral dopaminergic neurons exhibited normal morphological and electrophysiological properties with normal responses to dopamine receptor activation, a significantly lower dopamine release was measured in the striatum of PINK1(+/-) mice compared with control mice, suggesting that a decrease in stimulus-evoked dopamine overflow acts as a major determinant for the LTP deficit. Accordingly, pharmacological agents capable of increasing the availability of dopamine in the synaptic cleft restored normal LTP in heterozygous mice. Moreover, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors rescued physiological LTP and normal dopamine release. Our results provide novel evidence for striatal plasticity abnormalities, even in the heterozygous disease state. These alterations might be considered an endophenotype to this monogenic form of Parkinson's disease and a valid tool with which to characterize early disease stage and design possible disease-modifying therapies."

In addition, around the same time T. gondii parasites were found to be associated with severe intraocular inflammation. In the 1980s, T. gondii emerged as a major cause of death in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, illustrating the importance of the immune system in controlling T. gondii infection. T. gondii was reported as a major cause of abortion in sheep in New Zealand in the 1950s, which raised questions about potential new transmission routes for the parasite. The discovery of the cat as the definitive host in the 1960s was a very important finding as it helped to complete our understanding of the parasite's life cycle, and the oocyst stage of T. gondii shed in the faeces of infected cats was found to be an important source of infection for many intermediate hosts and helped to explain infection in herbivorous animals and people with a vegetarian diet. In addition, this stage of the parasite was very robust and could survive in the environment, depending on the climatic conditions, for up to 12-18 months. Knowledge of the parasite's life cycle, transmission routes, risk groups and host immune responses has helped in the development of strategies to control the disease, reduce transmission of the parasite and limit environmental contamination."

Using medaka fish as a vertebrate model to study Nanog function, we demonstrate that Ol-Nanog is necessary for S-phase transition and proliferation in the developing embryo. Moreover, inhibition or overexpression of Ol-Nanog does not affect gene expression of various pluripotency and differentiation markers, suggesting that this transcription factor may not play a direct role in embryonic germ layer differentiation.

Here we demonstrate that clonal pathogens that evolve under severely relaxed selection are uniquely suitable for studying mutational biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational patterns using sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of genomic nucleotide content. We demonstrate that across different types of sites and in all four clades mutation is consistently biased towards AT. This is true even in clades that have high genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A transitions. These results suggest that bacterial mutational biases are far less variable than previously thought. They further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide content cannot stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as biased gene conversion strongly affect nucleotide content."

Investigation of murine models of this disease has led to improved understanding of the mechanisms that underlie many of the phenotypic features of MFS, including MV disease. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a related disorder due to heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the TGF\u03b2 receptor, and it may also involve the MV leaflets with similar elongation and thickening of the MV leaflets. Although the genetic basis and pathogenesis of nonsyndromic MV prolapse has been elusive to date, insights derived from monogenic disorders like MFS and LDS can be informative with regard to novel gene discovery and investigation into the pathogenesis of MV disease.

Translational fusion to yellow fluorescent protein revealed AtLon1 subcellular localization in plant mitochondria, and the AtLon1 gene could complement the respiratory-deficient phenotype of the yeast PIM1 gene homolog. AtLon1 is highly expressed in rapidly growing plant organs of embryonic origin, including cotyledons and primary roots, and in inflorescences, which have increased mitochondria numbers per cell to fulfill their high energy requirements. In lon1 mutants, the expression of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes encoding respiratory proteins was normal. However, mitochondria isolated from lon1 mutants had a lower capacity for respiration of succinate and cytochrome c via complexes II and IV, respectively. Furthermore, the activity of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was significantly reduced. Additionally, mitochondria in lon1 mutants had an aberrant morphology. These results shed light on the developmental mechanisms of selective proteolysis in plant mitochondria and suggest a critical role for AtLon1 protease in organelle biogenesis and seedling establishment."

We devised an in vivo screening strategy based on monitoring Ras activation and phenotypic physiological outputs for assaying synthetic Ras function inhibitors (RFI). Ras activity was visualized by the translocation of RBD Raf1 -GFP to activated Ras at the plasma membrane. By using this strategy, we screened one synthetic farnesyl substrate analog (AGOH) along with nine putative inhibitors and found that only m-CN-AGOH inhibited Ras activation. Phenotypic analysis of starving cells could be used to monitor polarization, motility, and the inability of these treated cells to aggregate properly during fruiting body formation. Incorporation of AGOH and m-CN-AGOH to cellular proteins was detected by western blot.

Type I deiodinase (D1) catalyzes both reactions. Over the last years, several studies have attempted to understand the mechanisms of D1 function, underlying its effects on normal thyroid hormone metabolism and pathological processes. Although peripheral D1-generated T(3) production contributes to a portion of plasma T(3) in euthyroid state, pathologically increased thyroidal D1 activity seems to be the main cause of the elevated T(3) concentrations observed in hyperthyroid patients. On the other hand, D1-deficient mouse models show that, in the absence of D1, inactive and lesser iodothyronines are excreted in feces with the loss of associated iodine, demonstrating the scavenging function for D1 that might be particularly important in an iodine deficiency setting. Polymorphisms in the DIO1 gene have been associated with changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, whereas decreased D1 activity has been reported in the nonthyroid illness syndrome and in several human neoplasias. The current review aims at presenting an updated picture of the recent advances made in the biochemical and molecular properties of D1 as well as its role in human physiology."

Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis."

Whereas the genetic background of hereditary pheochromocytomas is becoming rather well-defined, very little is known about the more common sporadic form of the disease which constitutes \u223c70% of all cases. In this study, we elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms behind sporadic pheochromocytoma by performing a comprehensive analysis of copy number alterations, gene expression, promoter methylation and somatic mutations in the genes RET, VHL, NF1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, KIF1B\u03b2, TMEM127 and MAX, which have been associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Our genomic and genetic analyses of 42 sporadic pheochromocytomas reveal that a large proportion (83%) has an altered copy number in at least one of the known susceptibility genes, often in association with an altered messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Specifically, 11 sporadic tumors (26%) displayed a loss of one allele of the NF1 gene, which significantly correlated with a reduced NF1 mRNA expression. Subsequent sequencing of NF1 mRNA, followed by confirmation in the corresponding genomic DNA (gDNA), revealed somatic truncating mutations in 10 of the 11 tumors with NF1 loss. Our results thus suggest that the NF1 gene constitutes the most frequent (24%) target of somatic mutations so far known in sporadic pheochromocytomas."

We conducted a randomized trial wherein patients being treated with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen received prophylaxis with either valaciclovir 500 mg orally daily or valganciclovir 450 mg orally twice daily. The study design planned to enroll 128 patients, but stopping rules for early termination were met. Forty patients were evaluable. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-83 years); median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10). Diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3), hairy cell leukemia (1), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (1), marginal zone leukemia (1), large granular lymphocyte leukemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), and T-cell lymphoma (2).

Seven of 20 patients enrolled on the valaciclovir arm experienced CMV reactivation. None of the 20 patients randomized to valganciclovir experienced CMV reactivation (P = .004). In conclusion, this agent was highly effective for prophylaxis of CMV reactivation in patients receiving alemtuzumab. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT00562770."

Out of 68 cases, 29% show somatic mutations on BCL6 which occur exclusively in IGHV mutated cases. They are single nucleotide substitutions located mainly in two short mutational hot spots. CLL cells express different levels of BCL6 regardless of the mutational status, the number of mutations and polymorphisms. CLL cases expressing high levels of BCL6 have significantly shorter treatment-free interval. In conclusion, in early-stage patients with CLL, we found no correlation between expression and the mutations or polymorphism in BCL6, but high levels of BCL6 can discriminate patients with a worse prognosis."

This has complicated attempts to establish a definite karyotype-phenotype correlation. We report a further case with a de novo interstitial deletion of the region 5q?15 to 5q?22 identified by standard karyotype analysis. The proband presented with failure to thrive, developmental delay, distinct craniofacial dysmorphic features, and associated structural anomalies (amongst them cleft palate, iris colobomata, and horseshoe kidney, which have previously been reported in 5q deletion cases). In addition, this child had an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation that required surgical decompression. FISH studies using BAC clones spanning the 5q15 to 5q22 region revealed that these were all present in both homologues. Use of more distal clones allowed delineation of the deleted region to 5q22.3q23.3 and to narrow down the breakpoints to approximately 200 kb. The 14 Mb deleted region contains about 60 genes but, with the possible exception of FBN2 and DMXL1, there are no obvious candidate genes for the specific components of the phenotype. This case illustrates the discrepancy between cytogenetic and molecular techniques in trying to delineate 5q interstitial deletions. Molecular studies need to be performed on these patients, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation and to understand the role and influence of genes in this region."

The \"top down\" mass spectrometry approach detected dramatic decreases in acetylation on H3 and H2B in gcn5Delta cells versus wild type. For H3 in wild type cells, tandem mass spectrometry revealed a direct correlation between increases of Lys(4) trimethylation and the 0, 1, 2, and 3 acetylation states of histone H3. The results show a wide swing from 10 to 80% Lys(4) trimethylation levels on those H3 tails harboring 0 or 3 acetylations, respectively. Reciprocity between these chromatin marks was apparent, since gcn5Delta cells showed a 30% decrease in trimethylation levels on Lys(4) in addition to a decrease of acetylation levels on H3 in bulk chromatin. Deletion of Set1, the Lys(4) methyltransferase, was associated with the linked disappearance of both Lys(4) methylation and Lys(14) and Lys(18) or Lys(23) acetylation on H3.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of the resulting digests enabled identification of 120 proteins from a single dried blood spot.

The trigger is thought to be the presence of an irreversibly blocked transcription complex, which is recognised by a transcription-repair coupling factor. Many common DNA lesions do not block transcription, but are bypassed with varying degrees of efficiency and with potentially mutagenic effects on the RNA transcripts that are produced. The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. We have investigated the effect of Mfd during transcription of templates containing 8-oxoguanine, and various other non-bulky lesions. We show that an 8-oxoguanine in the template strand induces a transient pause in transcription, and that Mfd neither increases nor decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses the lesion. We also show that Mfd can displace a transcription complex stalled at a single strand nick, and that it decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses an abasic site. These activities are not affected by transcription rate, as similar results were obtained using \"fast\" and \"slow\" mutant RNA polymerases. Our findings suggest that 8-oxoguanine is unlikely to be directly targeted by the transcription-coupled repair pathway, and identify a potential role for Mfd in reducing the level of transcriptional mutagenesis caused by abasic sites."

The mutations were found to segregate as heterozygotes in the maternal and the paternal lineage, respectively. None of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical long QT syndrome (LQTS). No hearing defects were found in the proband. The data strongly indicates that the compound heterozygosity for R518X and A525T is the cause of an autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. Our findings support the implication of a higher frequency of gene carriers than previously expected. We suggest that relatives of 'sporadic RWS' patients should be considered potential carriers, at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS."

In 93 patients, a type V collagen defect was found, of which 73 were COL5A1 mutations, 13 were COL5A2 mutations and seven were COL5A1 null-alleles with mutation unknown. The majority of the 73 COL5A1 mutations generated a COL5A1 null-allele, whereas one-third were structural mutations, scattered throughout COL5A1. All COL5A2 mutations were structural mutations. Reduced availability of type V collagen appeared to be the major disease-causing mechanism, besides other intra- and extracellular contributing factors. All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. No COL5A1/COL5A2 mutation was detected in 24 patients who displayed skin and joint hyperextensibility but lacked dystrophic scarring. Overall, over 90% of patients fulfilling all major Villefranche criteria for classic EDS were shown to harbor a type V collagen defect, which indicates that this is the major--if not only--cause of classic EDS."

We performed clinical and molecular analyses of a patient with AS, and found a novel mutation (G215D) of KCNJ2. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed a long QT interval and frequent premature ventricular contractions, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Use of a conventional whole-cell patch-clamp system with COS7 cells demonstrated that the G215D mutant was non-functional, and that co-expression of wild type (WT)- and mutant-KCNJ2 shows a dominant negative effect on both inward and outward currents. We performed confocal laser scanning microscopy to assess the cellular trafficking of WT- and mutant-KCNJ2 subunits tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), respectively. Tagging with the YFP did not affect the channel function of WT-KCNJ2 and both proteins showed similar plasma membrane fluorescence patterns. Furthermore, the result of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies at the plasma membrane region suggested that both YFP-tagged WT- and CFP-tagged mutant-KCNJ2 combine to construct a hetero-multimer of the potassium channel. In conclusion, the G215D mutant of KCNJ2 is distributed normally in the plasma membrane, but exhibits a dominant-negative effect and reduces the Kir2.1 current, presumably due to hetero-multimer construction."

We report the functional characterization of a previously unrecognized synonymous variant, c.891C>T (p.Cys297Cys), identified in the SPINK5 exon 11 of an NS patient. We demonstrated that the c.891C>T mutation is associated with abnormal pre-mRNA splicing and residual LEKTI expression in the patient's keratinocytes. Subsequent minigene splicing assays and in silico predictions confirmed the direct role of the synonymous mutation in inhibiting exon 11 inclusion by a mechanism that involves the activity of exonic regulatory sequences, namely splicing enhancer and silencer. However, this deleterious effect was not complete and a residual amount of normal mRNA and LEKTI protein could be detected, correlating with the relatively mild patient's phenotype. Our study represents the first identification of a disease-causing SPINK5 mutation that alters splicing without affecting canonical splice sites."

The small interface between the Notch ankyrin domains could accommodate DNA bending and untwisting to allow a range of spacer lengths between the two sites. Cooperative dimerization occurred on the human and mouse Hes5 promoters at a sequence that diverged from the CSL-binding consensus at one of the sites.

Epigenetic phenomena have gained increased attention in the field of cancer research, with many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine residues, especially in histones, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. In this study, we describe the application of a miniaturized, radioisotope-based reaction system: the HotSpot(SM) platform for methyltransferases. Since this platform employs tritiated SAM as a cofactor, it can be applied to the assay of any HMT. The key advantage of this format is that any substrate can be used, including peptides, proteins, or even nucleosomes, without the need for labeling or any other modifications. Using this platform, we have determined substrate specificities, characterized enzyme kinetics, performed compound profiling for both lysine and arginine methyltransferases, and carried out HTS for a small-library LOPAC against DOT1L. After hit confirmation and profiling, we found that suramin inhibited DOT1L, NSD2, and PRMT4 with IC\u2085\u2080 values at a low \u03bcM range."

However, previous methods usually deal with disjoint gene groups partitioned or clustered by arbitrary cutoffs, which might cause information losses. To preclude the defining step of gene set, we adopted enrichment analysis and termed the method binding site enrichment analysis (BSEA). BSEA was first applied for publicly available ChIP-on-chip data of c-MYC, MAX and E2F transcription factors, identifying significant enrichment for signatures of corresponding factors and potential co-activators. Using time-scaled expression profiling of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, we observed enrichment for signatures of known adipogenic factors such as C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta and PPARgamma, temporally coincident with previous reports. BSEA was also applied to tissue-specific expression profiles of human and mouse, identifying well-known tissue-specific transcription factors such as HNF-4 in liver and MEF-2 in heart along with other putative tissue-specific regulators. With extended versatility coping with various kinds of microarray dataset, BSEA can identify key regulators for global microarray data in which transcriptional regulation plays a major role. As a generalized method, BSEA would help to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory networks, the primary challenges in functional genomics."

Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. We can introduce variable changes mediated by non-homologous end joining of DNA breaks to inactive genes. Alternatively, using homology-directed repair, we have introduced specific changes that support either precise alterations in a gene's encoded polypeptide, elimination of the gene or replacement by another unrelated DNA sequence. Depending on the gene and the mutation, we can achieve 10%-50% effective rates of precise mutations. Applications of the new precision genetics are extensive. Livestock now can be engineered with selected phenotypes that will augment their value and adaption to variable ecosystems. In addition, animals can be engineered to specifically mimic human diseases and disorders, which will accelerate the production of reliable drugs and devices. Moreover, animals can be engineered to become better providers of biomaterials used in the medical treatment of diseases and disorders. "

Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3%-8% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37%-53%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18%-37%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47%-68%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure."

In addition to two known binding partners (HSP90, CDC37), 12 proteins were identified using the TAP assay; four of which are mitochondrially localized (GRP75, HSP60, LRPPRC, and TUFM). Western blot analysis showed no differences in cellular abundance of these proteins comparing PINK1 mutant and control fibroblasts.

Coupling between transcription and splicing has become crucial in the complex network underlying alternative splicing regulation. Because chromatin is the real template for nuclear transcription, changes in its structure, but also in the \"reading\" and \"writing\" of the histone code, could modulate splicing choices. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting these ideas, from the first proposal of chromatin affecting alternative splicing, performed 20 years ago, to the latest findings including genome-wide evidence that nucleosomes are preferentially positioned in exons. We focus on two recent reports from our laboratories that add new evidence to this field. The first report shows that a physiological stimulus such as neuron depolarization promotes intragenic histone acetylation (H3K9ac) and chromatin relaxation, causing the skipping of exon 18 of the neural cell adhesion molecule gene. In the second report, we show how specific histone modifications can be created at targeted gene regions as a way to affect alternative splicing: Using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we increased the levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the proximity of alternative exon 33 of the human fibronectin gene, favoring its inclusion into mature messenger RNA (mRNA) through a mechanism that recalls RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing."

Both diseases are characterized by progressive and fatal bone marrow failure. The nucleolar protein dyskerin is the pseudouridine synthase component of the box H+ACA snoRNAs and also interacts with the RNA component (human telomerase, hTR) of the telomerase complex. Dyskerin is therefore thought to function in the processing of pre-rRNA and of the hTR, strengthening the notion that the underlying mechanism of DKC is a premature senescence of cells, especially of the rapidly dividing epithelial and hemopoietic cells. To examine the functions of dyskerin in vivo, it will be necessary to generate mouse models. As a first step, we here provide the genomic structure of the mouse Dkc1 gene and expression analysis of the transcript. Northern hybridizations revealed the tissue-specific expression of an alternative 4.5-kb transcript, in addition to the ubiquitous 2.6-kb transcript. RNA in situ hybridizations on day 10.5-18.5 postconception embryos showed a ubiquitous expression of Dkc1 with a notably higher level of expression confined to the epithelial tissues. In addition, higher level Dkc1 expression was confined to embryonic neural tissues as well as to specific neurons in the cerebellum (Purkinje cells) and the olfactory bulb (mitral cells) of the adult brain. In adult testis, elevated expression was limited to the Leydig cells. The results indicate that some of the pertinent functions of dyskerin may be more tissue-specific than previously thought and are not limited to rapidly dividing cells."

To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation."

Overall, 1,046 Caucasian individuals were included in the study. A thousand of them were genotyped for MC1R variants: 509 were sporadic MM patients and 491 were healthy control subjects from general population. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, hair colour, eye colour, skin phototype and ancestry. We found that carriers of the R151C and R163Q variants were at an increased risk for melanoma OR 2.76 (1.59-4.78) and OR 5.62 (2.54-12.42), respectively. The risk of carrying RHC variants was 3.04 (1.90-4.86). Current study confirms the increased MM risk for R151C carriers. It also supports the association between R163Q variant and MM risk in the population on the Canary Islands, as opposed to reported on northern populations.

The aim of this study was to identify causative mutations in genes involved in Ca(2+) regulation in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu). These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population. In conclusion, mutations in Ca(2+) handling genes are an infrequent but important cause of FHC. DNA variants in Ca(2+) genes may also be involved as modifying factors in phenotype development. Further evaluation of the role of defects in Ca(2+) regulation will shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of FHC."

This project supported community-based patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to achieve increased levels of self-management and self-efficacy using electronic-monitoring techniques and mentoring by community health nurses. Participants had the option of voluntarily adopting an electronic patient diary to support their self-monitoring, which provided patients, nurses and clinicians with access to symptom and psycho-social data. This aimed to improve the identification, comprehension and initiation of early action in relation to alterations in their conditions. The paper presents data on technology adoption, electronic diary usage and, self-reported data quality, as well as examining the impact of the technology on hospitalisations (frequency and duration). The participants who chose to use the online patient diary continued their involvement with the project for the entire trial period (85% vs 54% completion). Participants were more likely to maintain use of the online patient diary than the paper diary. Both the groups experienced a positive improvement in their self-efficacy to self-manage their condition scores. The data highlight the problems implicit in some of the assumptions underpinning existing information systems models, especially in evaluating impact and the end-points presumed to be relevant in systems development life cycles."

The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. Recognition of autophagy receptors by autophagy effectors takes place through an LC3 interaction region (LIR). The canonical LIR motif consists of a WXXL sequence, N-terminally preceded by negatively charged residues. The LIR motif of NBR1 presents differences to this classical LIR motif with a tyrosine residue and an isoleucine residue substituting the tryptophan residue and the leucine residue, respectively. We have determined the structure of the GABARAPL-1/NBR1-LIR complex and studied the influence of the different residues belonging to the LIR motif for the interaction with several mammalian autophagy modifiers (LC3B and GABARAPL-1). Our results indicate that the presence of a tryptophan residue in the LIR motif increases the binding affinity. Substitution by other aromatic amino acids or increasing the number of negatively charged residues at the N-terminus of the LIR motif, however, has little effect on the binding affinity due to enthalpy-entropy compensation. This indicates that different LIRs can interact with autophagy modifiers with unique binding properties."

It is unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1, the ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway. Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in the fly whereas mammalian orthologs, like salvador, merlin, LATS, and YAP1, have been implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that YAP1 increases organ size and causes aberrant tissue expansion in mice. YAP1 activation reversibly increases liver size more than 4-fold. In the intestine, expression of endogenous YAP1 is restricted to the progenitor/stem cell compartment, and activation of YAP1 expands multipotent undifferentiated progenitor cells, which differentiate upon cessation of YAP1 expression. YAP1 stimulates Notch signaling, and administration of gamma-secretase inhibitors suppressed the intestinal dysplasia caused by YAP1. Human colorectal cancers expressing higher levels of YAP1 share molecular aspects with YAP1-induced dysplastic growth in the mouse. Our data show that the Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size in mammals and can act on stem cell compartments, indicating a potential link between stem/progenitor cells, organ size, and cancer."

In the mammalian inner ear there are at least nine different unconventional myosin isozymes expressed. Myosin 1 beta, VI, VIIa and probably XV are all expressed within a single cell in the inner ear, the hair cell. The myosin isozymes expressed in the hair cell all have unique domains of expression and in some areas, such as the pericuticular necklace, several domains overlap. This suggests that these myosins all have unique functions and that all are individually targeted within the hair cell.

Here we reveal that Sef, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of growth factor signaling, is\u00a0a spatial regulator of NF-\u03baB. Sef expression is regulated by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, and Sef specifically inhibits \"classical\" NF-\u03baB (p50:p65) activation by these ligands.

Accordingly, endogenous Sef knockdown markedly enhances stimulus-induced NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and consequent activity. This study establishes Sef as a feedback antagonist of proinflammatory cytokines and highlights its potential to regulate the crosstalk between proinflammatory cytokine receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases."

However, the concept of \"angiocrine\" signaling, in which signals produced by endothelial cells elicit tumor cell responses distinct from vessel function, has been proposed, yet remains underinvestigated. Here, we report that angiocrine factors secreted from endothelium regulate tumor growth and motility. We found that Slit2, which is negatively regulated by endothelial EphA2 receptor, is one such tumor suppressive angiocrine factor. Slit2 activity is elevated in EphA2-deficient endothelium. Blocking Slit activity restored angiocrine-induced tumor growth/motility, whereas elevated Slit2 impaired growth/motility. To translate our findings to human cancer, we analyzed EphA2 and Slit2 expression in human cancer. EphA2 expression inversely correlated with Slit2 in the vasculature of invasive human ductal carcinoma samples. Moreover, analysis of large breast tumor data sets revealed that Slit2 correlated positively with overall and recurrence-free survival, providing clinical validation for the tumor suppressor function for Slit2 in human breast cancer. Together, these data support a novel, clinically relevant mechanism through which EphA2 represses Slit2 expression in endothelium to facilitate angiocrine-mediated tumor growth and motility by blocking a tumor suppressive signal."

We use phosphoproteome analysis of mitotic exit to identify Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated at the time of cytokinesis. We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes.

Thus the reetiolated PLBs of wheat and rye did not differ from etiolated or reetiolated oat PLBs.

Given the probable importance of eosinophils to allergy and other associated disorders, IL-5 has been proposed as a potential molecular target in the treatment of these diseases. IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8). Anti-IL5 antibody therapy has been the most extensively studied of these agents, and trials have been performed in patients with bronchial asthma, nasal polyposis, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. In studies of asthmatics, anti-IL-5 showed minimal efficacy in patients with moderate, controlled asthma. In patients with severe, refractory asthma associated with eosinophilia, however, clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in asthma exacerbations. Clinical studies in other disorders, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome, have also shown significant improvements in blood and/or tissue eosinophilia and variable alterations in clinical disease activity. Strategies aimed at the inhibition of IL-5 may hold great promise in the treatment of eosinophilic diseases."

Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance is of special importance for genetic counseling and the prenatal diagnostics as regards severe forms of CMT. In the present study we report on two CMT families in which a newly identified Glu222Lys mutation within the GDAP1 gene segregates both in autosomal dominant and recessive traits. Our study shows that at least some GDAP1 gene mutations may segregate with the CMT phenotype as both dominant and recessive traits.

This compound stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), which is a member of a family of proteins involved in stress-mediated signaling pathways. Consistent with this, MEKK1 activates IRF3 in addition to ATF2/c-JUN and NF-kappaB for the assembly of the IFN-beta enhanceosome. MEKK1 activates IRF3 through the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway but not the p38 and IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathway. Taken together with previous observations, these results implicate that, for the assembly of an IFN-beta enhanceosome, MEKK1 can induce IRF3 and ATF2/c-JUN through the JNK pathway, whereas it can induce NF-kappaB through the IKK pathway. Thus, specific MEKK family proteins may be able to integrate some of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the specific activation of the IFN-beta enhanceosome."

A major reason is that TF binding profiles significantly overlap and are therefore highly correlated. Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations. Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals. It is thus of great interest to distinguish TFs that directly regulate gene expression from those that are indirectly associated with gene expression. Graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, provide a powerful mathematical framework to infer different types of dependencies. However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small. Here, we develop a novel computational method, the Neighbourhood Consistent PC (NCPC) algorithms, which deal with these scenarios much more effectively than existing methods do. We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables. NCPC and DDGraph can also be applied to other problems involving highly correlated biological features. Both methods are implemented in the R package ddgraph, available as part of Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/html/ddgraph.html). Applied to real data, our method identified TFs that specify different classes of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in Drosophila mesoderm differentiation. Our analysis also found depletion of the early transcription factor Twist binding at the CRMs regulating expression in visceral and somatic muscle cells at later stages, which suggests a CRM-specific repression mechanism that so far has not been characterised for this class of mesodermal CRMs."

A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression. The sample (N = 322) consisted of parents of children with ASD referred to two specialist clinics. The sample contained parents of children with Autistic Disorder (n = 76), Asperger Disorder (n = 188), Pervasive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (n = 21), and children with a non-ASD or no diagnosis (n = 37). Parents completed questionnaires on-line via a secure website. The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences. The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low. Further research is needed on the potentially different meanings of family cohesion and conflict for children with ASD relative to children without ASD."

Typically, such methods are targeted to a certain class of ncRNA. Many methods rely on RNA secondary structure prediction, which is not always accurate and not all ncRNA classes are characterized by a common secondary structure. Unbiased classification methods for ncRNAs could be important to improve accuracy and to detect new ncRNA classes in sequencing data."

Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP). We also found a comparable impairment of LTM in dTORC2-deficient flies, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway. Actin polymerization was reduced in the hippocampus of mTORC2-deficient mice and its restoration rescued both L-LTP and LTM. Moreover, a compound that promoted mTORC2 activity converted early LTP into late LTP and enhanced LTM. Thus, mTORC2 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction."

The key idea of contrast word analysis with respect to RMS recognition sites, is that under-represented words are likely to be selected against. Starting from over- or underrepresented words corresponding to RMS recognition sites in specific clades, the specificity of unknown R-M systems can be highlighted. Among the known restriction enzymes, that are described in the REBASE database of restriction and modification systems, many of their recognition sites are still uncharacterized. Eventually, this motivates studies aimed at assessing horizontal transferring events of RMS in micro-organisms through the analysis of word usage biases in well-determined genomic regions. A probabilistic model is built on a first-order Markovian chain. Statistics on the k-neighborhood of a word is carried out to assess the biological significance of a genomic motif. Efficient word counting procedures have been implemented and statistics are used for the assessment of the significance of individual words in large sequences. On the basis of the set of most avoided words, and in accordance to the IUPAC coding standards, suggestions are made regarding potential recognition sequences. In certain cases, a comparison of avoided palindromic words in taxonomically related bacteria shows a pattern of relatedness of their R-M systems. For strengthening this analysis, the primary protein structure of all type II R-M systems known in REBASE have been blasted against the nr-GENBANK database. The combination of these analyses has revealed some interesting examples of possible horizontal transfer events of R-M systems."

We investigated the expression pattern of the family genes in the upper gastrointestinal epithelium and cancers. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that, unlike GSDMA expressed in differentiated cells, GSDMB is expressed in proliferating cells and GSDMD in differentiating cells. GSDMC, meanwhile, is expressed in both differentiating and differentiated cells. Colony formation assay showed that GSDMB, closely related to GSDMA, has no cell-growth inhibition activity in gastric cancer cells, and that GSDMC and GSDMD, respectively, exhibit the activity with different strengths from that of GSDMA. Expression analyses of the four family genes in esophageal and GCs suggested that GSDMC and GSDMD as well as GSDMA are tumor suppressors and that GSDMB, which was amplified and overexpressed in some GCs, could be an oncogene.

Whereas yeast mRNAs have no additional modifications to the cap, called cap0, higher eukaryotes are methylated at the 2'-O-ribose of the first or the first and second transcribed nucleotides, called cap1 and cap2, respectively. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). We show in vitro that hMTr1 catalyzes specific methylation of the 2'-O-ribose of the first nucleotide of a capped RNA transcript. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of hMTr1 in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that hMTr1 is responsible for cap1 formation in vivo."

How signalling pathways control and coordinate the activity of these crosslinkers is poorly defined. IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo. However, the manner of regulation of this activity in the full-length protein remains largely unknown. Eps8 is involved in actin dynamics through its actin barbed-ends capping activity and its ability to modulate Rac activity. Moreover, Eps8 binds to IRSp53. Here, we describe a novel actin crosslinking activity of Eps8. Additionally, Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo. Cdc42 binds to and controls the cellular distribution of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, supporting the existence of a Cdc42-IRSp53-Eps8 signalling pathway. Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8. Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions."

An acidic type I alpha-keratin is present in basal and suprabasal layers, early differentiating clear, oberhautchen, and beta-cells. Type I keratin apparently disappears in differentiated beta- and alpha-layers of the mature corneous layers. Conversely, a basic type II alpha-keratin rich in glycine is absent or very scarce in basal and suprabasal layers and this keratin likely does not pair with type I keratin to form intermediate filaments but is weakly detected in the pre-corneous and corneous alpha-layer. Single and double labeling experiments show that in differentiating beta-cells, basic KAbetaPs are added and replace type-I keratin to form the hard beta-layer. Epidermal alpha-keratins contain scarce cysteine (0.2-1.4 %) that instead represents 4-19 % of amino acids present in KAbetaPs. Possible chemical bonds formed between alpha-keratins and KAbetaPs may derive from electrostatic interactions in addition to cross-linking through disulphide bonds. Both the high content in glycine of keratins and KAbetaPs may also contribute to increase the hydrophobicy of the beta- and alpha-layers and the resistance of the corneous layer. The increase of gly-rich KAbetaPs amount and the bonds to the framework of alpha-keratins give rise to the inflexible beta-layer while the cys-rich KAbetaPs produce a pliable alpha-layer."

Here, we provide the first identification of a Seckel Syndrome patient with mutations in ATRIP, the gene encoding ATR-Interacting Protein (ATRIP), the partner protein of ATR required for ATR stability and recruitment to the site of DNA damage. The patient has compound heterozygous mutations in ATRIP resulting in reduced ATRIP and ATR expression. A nonsense mutational change in one ATRIP allele results in a C-terminal truncated protein, which impairs ATR-ATRIP interaction; the other allele is abnormally spliced. We additionally describe two further unrelated patients native to the UK with the same novel, heterozygous mutations in ATR, which cause dramatically reduced ATR expression. All patient-derived cells showed defective DNA damage responses that can be attributed to impaired ATR-ATRIP function. Seckel Syndrome is characterised by microcephaly and growth delay, features also displayed by several related disorders including Majewski (microcephalic) osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II and Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). The identification of an ATRIP-deficient patient provides a novel genetic defect for Seckel Syndrome. Coupled with the identification of further ATR-deficient patients, our findings allow a spectrum of clinical features that can be ascribed to the ATR-ATRIP deficient sub-class of Seckel Syndrome. ATR-ATRIP patients are characterised by extremely severe microcephaly and growth delay, microtia (small ears), micrognathia (small and receding chin), and dental crowding. While aberrant bone development was mild in the original ATR-SS patient, some of the patients described here display skeletal abnormalities including, in one patient, small patellae, a feature characteristically observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome. Collectively, our analysis exposes an overlapping clinical manifestation between the disorders but allows an expanded spectrum of clinical features for ATR-ATRIP Seckel Syndrome to be defined."

In the present study the effect of highly purified C-PC was tested on growth and multiplication of human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562). The results indicate significant decrease (49%) in the proliferation of K562 cells treated with 50 microM C-PC up to 48 h. Further studies involving fluorescence and electron microscope revealed characteristic apoptotic features like cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of cells treated with C-PC showed fragmentation pattern typical for apoptotic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with 25 and 50 microM C-PC for 48 h showed 14.11 and 20.93% cells in sub-G0/G1 phase, respectively. C-PC treatment of K562 cells also resulted in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. These studies also showed down regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 but without any changes in pro-apoptotic Bax and thereby tilting the Bcl-2/Bax ratio towards apoptosis. These effects of C-PC appear to be mediated through entry of C-PC into the cytosol by an unknown mechanism. The present study thus demonstrates that C-PC induces apoptosis in K562 cells by cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, PARP cleavage and down regulation of Bcl-2."

In mammals, the alpha gene generates, in addition to the normal receptor TRalpha1, a non-hormone-binding variant TRalpha2 whose exact function is unclear. Here, we present the phenotype associated with the targeted ablation of TRalpha2 expression. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1. Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/- mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones. However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation. The results thus suggest that the overexpression of TRalpha1 and the concomitant decrease in TRalpha2 expression lead to a mixed hyper- and hypothyroid phenotype, dependent on the tissue studied. The phenotypes suggest that the balance of TRalpha1:TRalpha2 expressed from the TRalpha gene provides an additional level of tuning the control of growth and homeostasis in mammalian species."

CCN1 is associated with the development of various cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness. CCN1 mRNA and protein were detected in the early precursor lesions, and their expression intensified with disease progression. However, biochemical activity and the molecular targets of CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells are unknown. Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis. SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1. Notably, active Notch-1is recruited by CCN1 in these cells via the inhibition of proteasomal degradation results in stabilization of the receptor. We find that CCN1-induced activation of SHh signaling might be necessary for CCN1-dependent in vitro pancreatic cancer cell migration and tumorigenicity of the side population of pancreatic cancer cells (cancer stem cells) in a xenograft in nude mice. Moreover, the functional role of CCN1 could be mediated through the interaction with the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor. These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance."

Other selective thyromimetic, KB- 2115 and KB - 141 have similar effects.

With chymotrypsin-like enzymatic activity, hK3 is directly and indirectly involved in a number of diverse biological functions including male fertility, the regulation of cell proliferation, and the inhibition of angiogenesis. The gene encoding hK3, hKLK3, is located on chromosome 19 and its expression has been shown to be regulated by steroid hormones through androgen receptor-mediated transcription. hK3 was once thought to be exclusively expressed and secreted by prostatic epithelial cells, hence the initial name of prostate-specific antigen, but has since been isolated in several nonprostatic tissues and ongoing characterization of alternative splicing variants has found at least 13 distinct mRNA transcripts. The detection of hK3 in cerebrospinal fluid prompted the hypothesis that hK3 may be produced in the brain. To test this notion, in this study we used RT-PCR amplification of brain tissue total RNA and examined hK3 protein by immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analysis. RT-PCR revealed several hK3 mRNA transcripts in the brain. Confirming these findings, both immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting showed evidence for hK3 protein in neuronal cells. Taken together, our findings support the expression of hK3 in neuronal cells reinforcing the concept of hK3 as a ubiquitous protein with more multifarious biological activity than previously believed. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the functional significance of hK3 in brain cells."

Two double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate single ascending doses of 1-20\u2009mg and multiple ascending doses of 2-20\u2009mg QD and 5\u2009mg BID for 10 or 28 days in healthy volunteers. Following oral administration, baricitinib plasma concentration typically attains its peak value within 1.5\u2009hours postdose and subsequently declines in a bi-exponential fashion. Baricitinib demonstrates dose-linear and time-invariant pharmacokinetics, with low oral-dose clearance (17\u2009L/h) and minimal systemic accumulation observed following repeat dosing. The mean renal clearance of baricitinib was determined to be \u223c2\u2009L/h. The effect of a high-fat meal on baricitinib pharmacokinetics was insignificant. The pharmacodynamics of baricitinib, evaluated by the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation following cytokine stimulation in the whole blood ex vivo, was well correlated with baricitinib plasma concentrations. Baricitinib was generally safe and well tolerated, with no serious treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported from either of the studies. An expected rapidly reversible, dose-related decline in absolute neutrophil count was seen with baricitinib. "

The Capture-SELEX procedure allows the selection of DNA aptamers for solute targets. A special SELEX library was constructed with the aim to immobilize this library on magnetic beads or other surfaces. For this purpose a docking sequence was incorporated into the random region of the library enabling hybridization to a complementary oligo fixed on magnetic beads. Oligonucleotides of the library which exhibit high affinity to the target and a secondary structure fitting to the target are released from the beads for binding to the target during the aptamer selection process. The oligonucleotides of these binding complexes were amplified, purified, and immobilized via the docking sequence to the magnetic beads as the starting point of the following selection round. Based on this Capture-SELEX procedure, the successful DNA aptamer selection for the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin A as a small molecule target is described."

Distribution, movement, and reception of Hh signals are tightly regulated, and abnormal Hh signaling is associated with developmental defects and cancer. In addition to the integral membrane proteins Patched and Smoothened, members of the Drosophila Ihog family of adhesion-like molecules have recently been shown to bind Hh proteins with micromolar affinity and positively regulate Hh signaling. Cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO) and Brother of CDO (BOC) are the closest mammalian relatives of Drosophila Ihog, and CDO binds Sonic Hh with micromolar affinity and positively regulates Hh signaling. Despite these similarities, structural and biochemical studies have shown that Ihog and CDO utilize nonorthologous domains and completely different binding modes to interact with cognate Hh proteins. We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC. These results show that all mammalian Hh proteins bind CDO and BOC in the same manner. We also show that interactions between Hh proteins and CDO are weakened at low pH. Formation of Hh-mediated Hh oligomers is thought to be an important feature of normal Hh signaling, but no conserved self-interaction between Hh proteins is apparent from inspection of 14 independent Hh-containing crystal lattices."

The transcription of the gal operon of Escherichia coli from two overlapping promoters P1 and P2 is negatively regulated via Gal repressosome assembly. It involves binding of two dimeric Gal repressor proteins (GalR) to two operators, O(E) and O(I), flanking the two promoters, and formation of 113 bp DNA loop due to tetramerization of the two bound GalR dimers. The process requires negatively supercoiled DNA and the presence of the histone-like protein HU. Previous modeling of the repressosome based on evaluation of DNA elastic energy suggested a mutual antiparallel, rather than parallel, orientation of the two gal operators in an under-twisted DNA loop. To visualize the Gal loop by atomic force microscopy (AFM), plasmid DNA molecules were constructed with increased distance between the two operators. The AFM results demonstrated the formation of an antiparallel DNA loop in the Gal repressosome consistent with our earlier hypothesis. Importantly, the overall shape of the GalR mediated loop proved to be indistinguishable from that in the chimerical loop of the same size containing two lac operators (instead of two gal operators) and formed by LacI. In addition, a possibility of the gal operon repression mediated by GalR in the absence of HU was shown in the new DNA constructs. Implications of these findings for the DNA structural organization in bacterial nucleoid are discussed."

Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients."

After the initial enthusiasm in establishing the infectious nature and the true agents of periodontal diseases, this concept was virtually ignored for the next four decades. Until the early 1970s treatment regimens based on the non-specific plaque hypothesis were directed towards a non-specific reduction in plaque amount. Later, the specific plaque hypothesis established the role of some microorganisms such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in different forms of periodontal diseases. It was recently suggested that these suspected periodontal pathogens seem to not act alone and interactions between species, especially the balance between pathogenic and beneficial species affect both progression of disease and response of tissues to periodontal therapy. Nowadays it is well established that one of the goals of therapy is to control such periodontal pathogens. Among the most commonly used therapies to treat periodontal infections are scaling and root planing (SRP), supragingival plaque control and periodontal surgeries. Many studies confirmed the reduction of \"red complex\" species by SRP, and apically repositioned flap can lead to an additional beneficial effect in the subgingival microbiota by decreasing levels of \"red\" and \"orange complexes\" species. Furthermore, the level of plaque control maintained by the patients has been considered a crucial step in preventing recurrence of destructive periodontitis."

Here, we focused on the role of the human paralogues CNOT7 (hCaf1/Caf1a) and CNOT8 (hPop2/Caf1b/Calif), which possess deadenylase activity mediated by DEDD nuclease domains. We show that efficient proliferation requires both subunits, although combined knockdown of CNOT7 and CNOT8 further reduces cell proliferation indicating partial redundancy between these proteins. Interestingly, the function of CNOT7 in cell proliferation partly depends on its catalytic activity. On the other hand, the interaction between CNOT7 and BTG2, a member of the antiproliferative BTG/Tob family involved in transcription and mRNA decay appears less important for proliferation of MCF7 cells, suggesting that CNOT7 does not function solely in conjunction with BTG2. Further analysis of gene expression profiles of CNOT7 and/or CNOT8 knockdown cells underscores the partial redundancy between these subunits and suggests that regulation of several genes, including repression of the antiproliferative genes MSMB and PMP22, by the Ccr4-Not complex contributes to cell proliferation."

TSLP requires a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-7 receptor \u03b1 subunit and its unique TSLP receptor (gene symbol CRLF2) to transmit signals in cells. Abnormal TSLP signaling (e.g. overexpression of TSLP or its unique receptor TSLPR) contributes to the development of a number of diseases including asthma and leukemia. However, a detailed understanding of the signaling pathways activated by TSLP remains elusive. In this study, we performed a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling network using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation, we determined that the phosphorylation status of 226 proteins was modulated by TSLP stimulation. Our analysis identified activation of several members of the Src and Tec families of kinases including Btk, Lyn, and Tec by TSLP for the first time. In addition, we report TSLP-induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatases such as Ptpn6 (SHP-1) and Ptpn11 (Shp2), which has also not been reported previously. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Shp2 binds to the adapter protein Gab2 in a TSLP-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of an inducible protein complex in TSLP signaling. A kinase inhibitor screen revealed that pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase, Jak family kinases, Src family kinases or Btk suppressed TSLP-dependent cellular proliferation making them candidate therapeutic targets in diseases resulting from aberrant TSLP signaling. Our study is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling pathway that greatly expands our understanding of TSLP signaling and provides novel therapeutic targets for TSLP/TSLPR-associated diseases in humans."

However, we have previously shown that 3' exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3' exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We next analyzed isolated ZNF 3' exons using stably integrated episomes. We found that although the H3K36me3 mark was lost when the 3' ZNF exon was removed from its natural genomic location, the isolated ZNF 3' exons retained the H3K9me3 mark. Thus, the H3K9me3 mark at ZNF 3' exons does not impede transcription and it is regulated independently of the H3K36me3 mark. Finally, we demonstrate a strong relationship between the number of tandemly repeated domains in the 3' exons and the H3K9me3 mark. We suggest that the H3K9me3 at ZNF 3' exons may function to protect the genome from inappropriate recombination rather than to regulate transcription."

We sought to increase statistical power to detect disease loci by conducting a GWAS mega-analysis for MDD. In the MDD discovery phase, we analyzed more than 1.2 million autosomal and X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18\u2009759 independent and unrelated subjects of recent European ancestry (9240 MDD cases and 9519 controls). In the MDD replication phase, we evaluated 554 SNPs in independent samples (6783 MDD cases and 50\u2009695 controls). We also conducted a cross-disorder meta-analysis using 819 autosomal SNPs with P<0.0001 for either MDD or the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium bipolar disorder (BIP) mega-analysis (9238 MDD cases/8039 controls and 6998 BIP cases/7775 controls). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the MDD discovery phase, the MDD replication phase or in pre-planned secondary analyses (by sex, recurrent MDD, recurrent early-onset MDD, age of onset, pre-pubertal onset MDD or typical-like MDD from a latent class analyses of the MDD criteria). In the MDD-bipolar cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)), and all were in a 248\u2009kb interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52\u2009425\u2009083-53\u2009822\u2009102, minimum P=5.9 \u00d7 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP finding should be interpreted with caution as the most significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status."

We estimated breast cancer risk associated with each of the 577 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 23 circadian clock genes. We also used a gene- and pathway-based approach to investigate the overall effect on breast cancer of circadian clock gene variants that might not be detected in analyses based on individual SNPs. Interactions with nightwork were tested at the SNP, gene, and pathway levels. We found that two SNPs in RORA (rs1482057 and rs12914272) were associated with breast cancer in the whole sample and among postmenopausal women. In this subpopulation, we also reported an association with rs11932595 in CLOCK, and with CLOCK, RORA, and NPAS2 in the analyses at the gene level. Breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women was also associated with overall genetic variation in the circadian gene pathway (P=0.04), but this association was not detected in premenopausal women. There was some evidence of an interaction between PER1 and nightwork in breast cancer in the whole sample (P=0.024), although the effect was not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing (P=0.452). Our results support the hypothesis that circadian clock gene variants modulate breast cancer risk."

By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls).

The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI group, the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier distinguished more reliably between converters and non-converters than the gray matter-based classifier. The visual read-based binary classification of (18)F-flutemetamol scans can be replicated using SVM. In this sample the specificity of (18)F-flutemetamol based SVM for distinguishing AD from controls is higher than that of gray matter volume-based SVM."

Forty-four P1 clones were determined to be unique based on restriction enzyme analysis, and 42 of these were found to originate from chromosome 16p13.3, based on FISH to metaphase chromosomes. The 700-kb interval could be defined by a single sequence-ready contig comprised of 12 P1 clones and 1 cosmid clone.

APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F interact with numerous proteins that regulate cellular RNA metabolism, including components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and colocalize with a subset of these proteins to mRNA processing bodies (P bodies), which are sites of mRNA translational repression and decay. We sought to determine the role of P bodies and associated proteins in HIV-1 replication and APOBEC3 antiviral activity. While we established a positive correlation between APOBEC3 protein incorporation into virions and localization to P bodies, depletion of the P-body components DDX6 or Lsm1 did not affect HIV-1 replication, APOBEC3 packaging into virions or APOBEC3 protein mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. In addition, neither HIV-1 genomic RNA nor Gag colocalized with P-body proteins. However, simultaneous depletion of multiple Argonaute family members, the effector proteins of RISC, could modestly increase viral infectivity. Because some APOBEC3 proteins interact with several Argonaute proteins, we also tested whether they could modulate microRNA (miRNA) activity. We found no evidence for the specific regulation of miRNA function by the APOBEC3 proteins, though more general effects on transfected gene expression were observed. In sum, our results indicate that P bodies and certain associated proteins do not regulate HIV-1 replication or APOBEC3 protein antiviral activity. Localization to P bodies may therefore provide a means of sequestering APOBEC3 enzymatic activity away from cellular DNA or may be linked to as yet unidentified cellular functions."

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a class of anticancer agents that affect many cellular processes, including mitosis. Here we examine the mechanism by which these drugs disrupt mitosis. We have used Drosophila melanogaster embryos to demonstrate that treatment with the HDACi 100 mug/ml suberic bishydroxamic acid (IC(50) 12 mug/ml), conditions that induce extensive H3K9 acetylation and aberrant mitosis in mammalian cells, induced aberrant mitosis in the absence of de novo transcription. We have examined the effect of the same treatment on the levels of H3K9 modification and HP1 binding in human cancer cells and found only minor effects on H3K9 methylation and HP1 binding. Complete loss of trimethylated H3K9 or depletion of HP1alpha and beta had no effect on mitosis, although specific depletion of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) replicates the mitotic defects induced by the drugs without increasing H3K9 acetylation. These data demonstrate that H3K9 methylation and HP1 binding are not the targets responsible for HDACi-induced aberrant mitosis, but it is a consequence of selective inhibition of HDAC3."

This 4-week post-marketing surveillance study was undertaken to assess patients' responses to levodopa combined with entacapone in a real clinical practice setting. Overall, 466 patients with idiopathic PD treated with levodopa and experiencing symptoms of wearing-off were recruited. Both physicians and patients recorded the response to therapy, including improvements and side-effects. Following initiation of entacapone treatment, the average daily levodopa dose was reduced from 510 to 453 mg. Physician assessment of entacapone efficacy was judged to be \"very good\" or \"good\" in 77.6% of the patients, and tolerability was considered to be \"very good\" or \"good\" in 92.4% of patients, with only 12 patients (2.6%) withdrawing from the study. Compared with baseline, there was a decrease in the mean duration of daily 'off' time from 3.0 to 1.3 h per day during the treatment period. Adverse events were in line with those previously reported, with diarrhoea being the most frequent event. The percentage of patients suffering from dyskinesia decreased from 46 to 34%, and of those patients still suffering from dyskinesia, the average daily duration of dyskinesia was reduced from 2.2 to 1.7 h. The use of adjunct dopamine agonists decreased from 67 to 59%. At study end, the percentage of patients who rated their quality of life (QoL) as \"very good\" or \"good\" increased from 12.1 to 51.7% and the percentage of patients who rated their QoL as \"bad\" or \"very bad\" decreased from 40 to 10.7%. In summary, the results of this survey conducted in real clinical practice support the findings of previous clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of entacapone, as well as the benefits of improved QoL, for patients achieved with entacapone."

Based on a candidate gene approach, we focused our investigations on triadin and junctin, two proteins that link RyR2 and CSQ2. Mutations in the triadin (TRDN) and in the junctin (ASPH) genes were searched in a cohort of 97 CPVT patients. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families, but no mutation was found in junctin. Two TRDN mutations, a 4 bp deletion and a nonsense mutation, resulted in premature stop codons; the third mutation, a p.T59R missense mutation, was further studied. Expression of the p.T59R mutant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular retention and degradation of the mutant protein. This was confirmed after in vivo expression of the mutant triadin in triadin knock-out mice by viral transduction. In this work, we identified TRDN as a new gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of CPVT. The mutations identified in the two families lead to the absence of the protein, thereby demonstrating the importance of triadin for the normal function of the cardiac calcium release complex in humans."

Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Here we present a strategy for ultrasensitive detection of tumor-specific mutations (E542K and E545K) and methylation of ctDNA of PIK3CA gene based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the coupling plasmon mode of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) is used as a probe to capture and enrich the 69-bp PIK3CA ctDNA. The exposure of PNA-probed AuNPs to 200 fM ctDNA generates LSPR-peak shift of 4.3 nm, corresponding to the primary response. Immunogold colloids are exploited as methylation detectors and plasmon coupling based enhancement for secondary response. LSPR-peak shifted from 4.3 nm to 11.4 nm upon the immunogold colloids binding to two methylcytosines (mCpG), which is an approximately 107% increase, compared to that of the primary response. This enhancement leads to four times (~50 fM) improvement of sensitivity and because of two mCpG sites, ctDNA was detected. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform."

Here, we describe the generation and first analysis of Oatp1c1-deficient mice. Oatp1c1 knockout (KO) mice were born with the expected frequency, were not growth retarded, and developed without any overt neurological abnormalities. Serum T(3) and T(4) concentrations as well as renal and hepatic deiodinase type 1 expression levels were indistinguishable between Oatp1c1 KO mice and control animals. Hypothalamic TRH and pituitary TSH mRNA levels were not affected, but brain T(4) and T(3) content was decreased in Oatp1c1-deficient animals. Moreover, increased type 2 and decreased type 3 deiodinase activities indicate a mild hypothyroid situation in the brain of Oatp1c1 KO mice. Consequently, mRNA expression levels of gene products positively regulated by T(3) in the brain were down-regulated. This central nervous system-specific hypothyroidism is presumably caused by an impaired passage of T(4) across the blood-brain barrier and indicates a unique function of Oatp1c1 in facilitating T(4) transport despite the presence of other thyroid hormone transporters such as Mct8."

Cultures of wild-type E. coli K12 and mutants for uvrA, uvrB, uvrC or uvrAC genes were treated with PUVA and cell survival was determined. In parallel, kinetics of DNA repair was also evaluated by the comparison of DNA sedimentation profiles in all the strains after PUVA treatment. The uvrB mutant was more sensitive to PUVA treatment than all the other uvr mutant strains. Wild-type strain, and uvrA and uvrC mutants were able to repair PUVA-induced lesions, as seen by DNA sedimentation profiles, while the uvrB mutant was unable to repair the lesions. In addition, a quadruple fpg nth xth nfo mutant was unable to nick PUVA-treated DNA when the crude cell-free extract was used to perform plasmid nicking. These data suggest that DNA repair of PUVA-induced lesions may require base excision repair functions, despite proficient UvrABC activity. These results point to a specific role for UvrB protein in the repair of psoralen adducts, which appear to be independent of UvrA or UvrC proteins, as described for the classical UvrABC endonuclease mechanism."

GPS has been linked to loss of function mutations in NEABL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), and we describe here a murine GPS model, the Nbeal2(-/-) mouse. As in GPS, Nbeal2(-/-) mice exhibit splenomegaly, macrothrombocytopenia, and a deficiency of platelet \u03b1-granules and their cargo, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), thrombospondin-1, and platelet factor 4. The platelet \u03b1-granule membrane protein P-selectin is expressed at 48% of wild-type levels and externalized upon platelet activation. The presence of P-selectin and normal levels of VPS33B and VPS16B in Nbeal2(-/-) platelets suggests that NBEAL2 acts independently of VPS33B/VPS16B at a later stage of \u03b1-granule biogenesis. Impaired Nbeal2(-/-) platelet function was shown by flow cytometry, platelet aggregometry, bleeding assays, and intravital imaging of laser-induced arterial thrombus formation. Microscopic analysis detected marked abnormalities in Nbeal2(-/-) bone marrow megakaryocytes, which when cultured showed delayed maturation, decreased survival, decreased ploidy, and developmental abnormalities, including abnormal extracellular distribution of VWF. Our results confirm that \u03b1-granule secretion plays a significant role in platelet function, and they also indicate that abnormal \u03b1-granule formation in Nbeal2(-/-) mice has deleterious effects on megakaryocyte survival, development, and platelet production.

Chromatin modifications implicated in transcriptional regulation are relatively well characterized and are thought to be the result of a code on the histone proteins (histone code). This code, involving phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, acetylation and methylation, is believed to regulate chromatin accessibility either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by recruiting non-histone proteins to chromatin. Recent evidences suggest that such mechanisms are also involved in DNA damage detection and DNA repair. One of the most well-characterized modifications is caused by the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), resulting in phosphorylation of histone H2AX (the so-called gamma-H2AX) on the chromatin surrounding the DNA lesion. It is generally believed that histone H2AX phosphorylation is required for the concentration and stabilization of DNA repair proteins to the damaged chromatin. The phosphorylation of this histone seems to play a role in both non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways. However, the choice of the repair pathway might depend on or induce additional post-translational modifications affecting other histone proteins necessary to the completion of the entire DNA repair process. Interestingly, even in the absence of DSBs, histone modifications occur. Indeed, following UV-exposure, histone acetylation takes place and is believed to facilitate the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process by promoting chromatin accessibility to the repair factors. This review focuses on recent data characterizing the function of histone modification in various repair processes and discusses if the combination of such modifications can be the trademark of a specific DNA repair pathway."

The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days. Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months. However, data from observational studies suggest that few patients with acute ischaemic stroke will be eligible for alteplase therapy under the terms of the current licensing agreement. In particular, many patients will be excluded by virtue of their age, and many more by the restriction of therapy to patients in whom treatment can be initiated within 3 hours of symptom onset. The manufacturer's submission included a state transition model evaluating the impact of treatment with alteplase within 3 hours of onset of stroke symptoms compared to standard treatment reporting that, in the base-case analysis, alteplase was both less costly and more effective than standard treatment. This increased to a maximum of approximately 4000 pounds upon one-way sensitivity analysis of the parameters. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis presented within the submission suggests that the probability that alteplase has a cost-effectiveness ratio greater than 20,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is close to 1 (0.99). The results of the short-term model demonstrate that alteplase is cost-effective over a 12-month period, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 14,026 pounds per QALY gained. This increased to a maximum of 50,000 pounds upon one-way sensitivity analysis of the parameters. At 12 months, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis presented within the submission suggests that the probability that alteplase has a cost-effectiveness ratio greater than 20,000 pounds per QALY gained is approximately 0.7. The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities."

Here we examined the functional role of this signaling regulatory protein (km23-1) in mediating the migration, invasion, and tumor growth of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. We show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of km23-1 in human CRC cells inhibited constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, as well as pro-invasive ERK effector functions that include phosphorylation of Elk-1, constitutive regulation of c-Fos-DNA binding, TGF\u03b21 promoter transactivation, and TGF\u03b21 secretion. In addition, knockdown of km23-1 reduced the paracrine effects of CRC cell-secreted factors in conditioned medium and in fibroblast co-cultures. Moreover, km23-1 depletion in human CRC cells reduced cell migration and invasion, as well as expression of the ERK-regulated, metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin. Finally, km23-1 inhibition significantly suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Thus, our results implicate km23-1 as a novel anti-metastasis target for human colon carcinoma cells, capable of decreasing tumor growth and invasion via a mechanism involving suppression of various pro-migratory features of CRC. These include a reduction in ERK signaling, diminished TGF\u03b21 production, decreased expression of the plasma membrane-cytoskeletal linker Ezrin, as well as attenuation of the paracrine effects of colon carcinoma-secreted factors on fibroblast migration and mitogenesis. As such, km23-1 inhibitors may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for interfering with colon cancer progression and invasion."

Here, we provide evidence that DNMT1 can support cell functions that do not require the C-terminal catalytic domain. We report that PCNA and DMAP1 domains in the N-terminal region of DNMT1 are sufficient to modulate E-cadherin expression in the absence of noticeable changes in DNA methylation patterns in the gene promoters involved. Changes in E-cadherin expression are directly associated with regulation of \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription. Present evidence suggests that the DNMT1 acts on E-cadherin expression through its direct interaction with the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor SNAIL1."

One of the models suggested by these results proposed that the triplet repeats on insertion-associated chromosomes were particularly prone to mutation. Studies of other triplet repeat disorders have suggested that arrays of perfect repeats are more prone to instability than those that are interrupted. We have examined the evolution of this locus by typing a variety of primates and samples drawn from several different human populations for both CTG repeat length and the insertion/deletion polymorphism. DM gene sequences from different primates revealed inter- and intraspecies variability in the number of CTG repeats. Human chromosomes with five repeats or 11-13 repeats (the two major modes of the human CTG repeat distributions) showed no evidence of preferential stabilization of these repeat sizes by imperfect sequences. The insertion and deletion allele frequencies showed large interpopulation variation and the degree of association between these alleles and various CTG repeat lengths is not nearly as complete as was previously supposed. We have found deletion alleles carrying long normal (> 19) CTG repeats and insertion alleles associated with CTG11 - 13 in two african populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

As a model, two lipid formulations were used for comparison. The first formulation is made of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and the zwitterionic lipid dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC), while the second mixture is made of the cationic 3\u03b2-[N-(N,N-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol) and the zwitterionic helper lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Our findings indicate that lipoplexes are efficiently taken up through fluid-phase macropinocytosis, while a less efficient uptake of LPD NPs occurs through a combination of both macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent pathways. Inside the cell, both lipoplexes and LPD NPs are actively transported towards the cell nucleus, as quantitatively addressed by spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS). For each lipid formulation, LPD NPs escape from endosomes more efficiently than lipoplexes. When cells were treated with DOTAP-DOPC-containing systems the majority of the DNA was trapped in the lysosome compartment, suggesting that extensive lysosomal degradation was the rate-limiting factors in DOTAP-DOPC-mediated transfection. On the other side, escape from endosomes is large for DC-Chol-DOPE-containing systems most likely due to DOPE and cholesterol-like molecules, which are able to destabilize the endosomal membrane. The lipid-dependent and structure-dependent enhancement of transfection activity suggests that DNA is delivered to the nucleus synergistically: the process requires both the membrane-fusogenic activity of the nanocarrier envelope and the employment of lipid species with intrinsic endosomal rupture ability."

Its transcription depends on the pathway-specific UaY zinc binuclear cluster protein and the broad domain AreA GATA factor. AzgA is not closely related to any other characterized membrane protein, but many close homologues of unknown function are present in fungi, plants, and prokaryotes but not metazoa. Two of three data bases and the phylogeny presented in this article places proteins of this family in a cluster clearly separated (but perhaps phylogenetically related) from the NAT family that includes other eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleobase transporters.

In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies. This preferential localization was seen on genes that are active in liver, genes that are inactive in liver, and intergenic regions but was absent from four regions that escape X inactivation. These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors. Also consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that the heterochromatin protein HP1beta copurifies with the macroH2A1-containing chromatin fragments. This study presents the first detailed examination of the distribution of macroH2A1 variants on specific sequences.

A total of 23 of 44 AML patients referred to the University of Munich for alloSCT in CR1 between 1999 and 2006 fulfilled these criteria and received FLAMSA chemotherapy, followed by RIC (4 Gy TBI/cyclophosphamide/ATG) for alloSCT. Twenty-two patients engrafted, one died in aplasia. Two-year cumulative incidences for relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 4.6 and 22.5%, respectively. Four-year overall and leukemia-free survival was 72.7% (median follow-up among survivors: 35 months). The results of this high-risk cohort were compared to the outcome of 21 consecutive standard-risk patients <55 years, who had received standard, myeloablative sibling SCT in CR1 AML within the same center and time period. Survival and cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were identical in both groups. In conclusion, the FLAMSA-RIC regimen produces long-term remission in a high proportion of patients with high-risk AML transplanted in CR1.

Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. NEMO not only confers structural stability to the IKK complex but also participates in the activation process of the IKK complex by linking the IKK subunits to upstream activators. In this study we analyze the IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO. In vitro, IKKbeta phosphorylates three serine residues in the domain of NEMO at positions 43, 68, and 85. However, mutational analysis revealed that only the phosphorylation of serine 68 in the center of the IKK-binding domain plays an essential role for the formation and the function of the IKK complex. Thus, Ser(68) phosphorylation attenuates the amino-terminal dimerization of NEMO as well as the IKKbeta-NEMO interaction. In contrast, the NEMO-IKKalpha interaction was only mildly affected by the phosphorylation of Ser(68). However, functional analysis revealed that Ser(68) phosphorylation primarily affects the activity of IKKalpha. Furthermore, in complementation experiments of NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, a S68A-NEMO mutant enhanced, whereas a S68E mutant decreased, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity, thus emphasizing the inhibitory role of the Ser(68) phosphorylation on the signal-induced NF-kappaB activity. Finally, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase PP2A is involved in the regulation of the Ser(68)-based mechanism. In summary, we provide evidence for a signal-induced phosphorylation-dependent alteration of the IKK complex emphasizing the dynamic nature of this multisubunit kinase complex."

Recent studies have shown that both SjS patients and NOD.B10-H2b mice exhibit increased B lymphocyte survival, B cell hyper-reactivity and hyper-gammaglobulinemia with high production of autoantibodies. To study the possible influence of complement on the development and expression of SjS-like disease of the NOD.B10-H2b, we have utilized a prophylactic treatment with CVF known to interfere with the action of complement C3 factor. NOD.B10-H2b mice, injected with CVF starting at 10 weeks of age, a time when leukocyte infiltration is expected to begin, failed to develop salivary dysfunction out to 24 weeks of age, a time when reduced salivary flow rates are known to occur in non-treated animals. Concomitant with retention of salivary exocrine function, CVF-treated mice showed reduced levels of leukocytic infiltration, reduction of anti-nuclear autoantibodies and major alterations in the B lymphocyte profiles while maintaining general pathophysiological measures of disease. These data suggest that C3 plays a significant role in development and onset of SjS-like disease, yet additional studies need to be carried out to identify the precise mode of action."

Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), an angiogenic factor, is concentrated in expanding adipose tissue, the possible effects of bFGF on regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in adipocytes were investigated. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with bFGF induced HIF-1\u03b1. Concomitantly, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is a target gene of HIF-1\u03b1, was induced at both mRNA and protein levels and was translocated to the plasma membrane. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and an RNA interference study indicated that bFGF-induced HIF-1\u03b1 directly upregulates GLUT1. In addition, it was observed that bFGF increases lactate production of adipocytes. This result indicates that bFGF reprograms the metabolism toward glycolysis. Intraperitoneal injection of bFGF into mice upregulated HIF-1\u03b1 and GLUT1 in adipose tissues, suggesting that bFGF regulates the metabolism of adipocytes via HIF-1\u03b1-GLUT1 regulation in vivo. We also found that bFGF inhibits insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt, suggesting that bFGF attenuates the insulin signal in adipocytes. Taken together, the findings suggest that bFGF has a harmful effect on the development of type 2 diabetes through metabolism reprogramming and attenuation of the insulin signal."

Though mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of insulin resistance and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, the precise mechanism linking the two is not well understood. We used high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity dependent diabetes mouse models to gain insight into the potential pathways altered with metabolic disease, and carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of liver mitochondria. As previously reported, proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, branched chain amino acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation were uniformly up-regulated in the liver of HFD fed mice compared with that of normal diet. Further, our studies revealed that retinol metabolism is distinctly down-regulated and the mitochondrial structural proteins-components of mitochondrial inter-membrane space bridging (MIB) complex (Mitofilin, Sam50, and ChChd3), and Tim proteins-essential for protein import, are significantly up-regulated in HFD fed mice. Structural and functional studies on HFD and normal diet liver mitochondria revealed remodeling of HFD mitochondria to a more condensed form with increased respiratory capacity and higher ATP levels compared with normal diet mitochondria. Thus, it is likely that the structural remodeling is essential to accommodate the increased protein content in presence of HFD: the mechanism could be through the MIB complex promoting contact site and crista junction formation and in turn facilitating the lipid and protein uptake.

However, it remains unclear whether T3 directly modulates underlying gene transcription and which thyroid receptor (TR) isoform might be responsible for gene transactivation. To clarify this situation, we analysed the role of T3 and its receptors alpha1 (TRalpha1) and beta1 (TRbeta1) in regulation of KCNA4, KCND2, KCND3 and KCNIP2 transcription in rat cardiomyocytes. Initial results demonstrated a T3-mediated increase of I(to) current density. T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected. To dissect the role of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 in T3-dependent I(to) modulation, TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 were overexpressed in cardiomyocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. To further evaluate a possible direct interaction of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 with the KCND3 promoter, TR expression vectors were cotransfected with a construct containing 2335 bp of the KCND3 5'-flanking sequence linked to a luciferase reporter into ventricular myocytes. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible promoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter sequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start site. Disruption of putative TR binding sites by mutagenesis abolished the TRalpha1- (G-1651T) and TRbeta1- (G-73T) mediated effects, indicating that TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 response elements map to different regions of the KCND3 promoter. Thus, I(to) is modulated by diverse T3-dependent regulation of underlying gene transcription. TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 exhibit distinct effects on KCND3 transactivation with TRalpha1 enhancing and TRbeta1 suppressing KCND3 transcription."

Although existing methodologies increased the number of computationally predicted enhancers, performance inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines, class imbalance within the learning sets and ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning, are some key questions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2% accuracy and 90% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1% and accuracy of 89.64%.

The search for biomarkers obtained from living donors has contributed already a vast amount of data. The role of amyloid and tau as early diagnostic markers in the pathology of dementia has been reported in differential involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD), late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), Lewy Body dementia (DLBD), Vascular dementia, fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and non neurological controls. In the coming decennia, brain/tissue/biobanks (BTB-banks) will have a major role in identifying the relevant biomarkers and will collect, preserve and type RNA and DNA extracted from brain/tissue/body fluids in order to update the pathological hallmarks of dementing disorders. The present paper reviews and compares the currently known/clinically applied biomarkers in dementia which can be identified and incorporated into clinical drug trials and elucidate proposed mechanisms of disease and drug action. Furthermore, the review screens a panel of biomarkers used for early and differential diagnosis and comments on the validity of these biomarkers in reflecting the typical hallmarks of neurological disorders."

To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome. The mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (IKr, IKs, and IK1). The phenotype is characterized by a shortened QT interval<335 ms after correction for heart rate at rates<80 beats/min. Furthermore, the QT interval poorly adapts to heart rate. Patients exhibit shortened atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and, in the majority, inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Death occurs already in newborns. Therapy of choice seems to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of the high incidence of sudden death. Pharmacological treatment has been studied and it could be demonstrated, that some mutant currents may be insufficiently suppressed by drugs targeted to block the specific current such as, e.g., sotalol or ibutilide in patients with a mutation in the IKr-coding gene KCNH2 (HERG). Quinidine proved to be efficient in prolonging the QT interval and normalizing the effective refractory periods in some patients."

Liver and kidney D1 mRNA and activity levels were reduced in TRbeta(-/-) but not TRalpha1(-/-) mice. Liver D1 remained weakly T3 inducible in TRbeta(-/-) mice whereas induction was abolished in double mutant TRalpha1(-/-)TRbeta(-/-) mice. This indicates that TRbeta is primarily responsible for regulating D1 expression whereas TRalpha1 has only a minor role. In kidney, despite the expression of both TRalpha1 and TRbeta, regulation relied solely on TRbeta, thus revealing a marked tissue restriction in TR isotype utilization. Although TRbeta and TRalpha1 mediate similar functions in vitro, these results demonstrate differential roles in regulating D1 expression in vivo and suggest that tissue-specific factors and structural distinctions between TR isotypes contribute to functional specificity. Remarkably, there was an obligatory requirement for a TR, whether TRbeta or TRalpha1, for any detectable D1 expression in liver. This suggests a novel paradigm of gene regulation in which the TR sets both basal expression and the spectrum of induced states. Physiologically, these findings suggest a critical role for TRbeta in regulating the thyroid hormone status through D1-mediated metabolism."

Indels are simulated under several models of indel-length distribution. The program implements a rich repertoire of substitution models, including the general unrestricted model and nonstationary nonhomogeneous models of nucleotide substitution, mixture, and partition models that account for heterogeneity among sites, and codon models that allow the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio to vary among sites and branches.

Orexin A and B are derived from the differential processing of a common precursor, the prepro-orexin peptide. The neuropeptides are expressed in a few thousand cells located in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but their projections and receptor distribution are widespread throughout the brain. Remarkably, prepro peptide and double (OX1R/OX2R) receptor knock out (KO) mice reproduce a sleep phenotype known in humans and dogs as narcolepsy/cataplexy. In humans, this disease is characterized by the absence of orexin producing cells in the LH, and severely depleted levels of orexin the cerebrospinal fluid. Null mutation of the individual OX1R or OX2R in mice substantially ameliorates the narcolepsy/cataplexy phenotype compared to the OX1R/OX2R KO, and highlights specific roles of the individual receptors in sleep architecture, the OX1R KO demonstrating an a attenuated sleep phenotype relative to the OX2R KO. It has therefore been suggested that orexin is a master regulator of the sleep-wake cycle, with high activity of the LH orexin cells during wake and almost none during sleep. Less than 10years later, the first orexin antagonist, almorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), was reported to be effective in inducing sleep in volunteers and insomnia patients. Although development was stopped for almorexant and for Glaxo's DORA SB-649868, no less than 4 orexin receptor antagonists have reached phase II for insomnia, including Filorexant (MK-6096) and Suvorexant (MK-4305) from Merck. Suvorexant has since progressed to Phase III and dossier submission to the FDA. These four compounds are reported as DORAs, however, they equilibrate very slowly at one and/or the other orexin receptor, and thus at equilibrium may show more or less selectivity for OX1R or OX2R. The appropriate balance of antagonism of the two receptors for sleep is a point of debate, although in rodent models OX2R antagonism alone appears sufficient to induce sleep, whereas OX1R antagonism is largely devoid of this effect. Orexin is involved in a number of other functions including reward and feeding, where OX1R (possibly OX2R) antagonists display anti-addictive properties in rodent models of alcohol, smoking, and drug self-administration. However, despite early findings in feeding and appetite control, orexin receptor antagonists have not produced the anticipated effects in models of increased food intake or obesity in rodents, nor have they shown marked effects on weight in the existing clinical trials. The role of orexin in a number of other domains such as pain, mood, anxiety, migraine and neurodegenerative diseases is an active area of research. The progress of the orexin field is thus extraordinary, and the community awaits the clinical testing of more receptor selective antagonists in sleep and other disorders, as well as that of orexin agonists, with the latter expected to produce positive outcomes in narcolepsy/cataplexy and other conditions.

Because most mutations are loss of function and detected by direct sequencing of coding exons, we reasoned that part of the approximately 50% mutation negative patients may have carried a copy number variant of ribosomal protein genes. As a proof of concept, we designed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay targeted to screen the six genes that are most frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients: RPS17, RPS19, RPS26, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. Using this assay we showed that deletions represent approximately 20% of all mutations. The combination of sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of these six genes allows the genetic characterization of approximately 65% of patients, showing that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is indisputably a ribosomopathy."

Since both cochlear and thyroid pathology are required to secure the diagnosis, it is unclear whether the condition might present without the classical features. The perchlorate discharge test, the gold-standard investigation for Pendred syndrome, is non-specific, and in the absence of alternative means of confirming the diagnosis, its sensitivity is unknown. We used the recent mapping of the gene to chromosome 7q to identify pedigrees with a likely diagnosis of Pendred syndrome, and assessed the prevalence of clinical parameters of disease in affected patients. Thirty-six familial cases showed co-segregation between disease and the Pendred syndrome locus on chromosome 7q. Clinical and investigative findings were compared in index cases (n = 18) vs. affected siblings (n = 18). The overall prevalence of goitre was 73%, higher in index cases (94%) than in siblings (56%), many of whom had not previously been considered to have the condition. One perchlorate discharge test was false-negative (2.9%). Radiological malformations of the cochlea were identified in 86% of cases. Securing a diagnosis of Pendred syndrome may be difficult, especially in the single case. The perchlorate discharge test, although valuable, is difficult to undertake in the younger patient, and radiology may assist in diagnosing such patients."

B. burgdorferi sensu lato, Rickettsia spp., and \"Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis\" were detected in ticks at all sites with global prevalences of 22.5%, 10.2%, and 6.4%, respectively. Babesia- and A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks showed a more restricted geographic distribution, and their prevalences were lower (1.9% and 1.5%, respectively). Species rarely reported in Switzerland, like Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia lusitaniae, and Rickettsia monacensis, were identified. Infections with more than one pathogenic species, involving mostly Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia helvetica, were detected in 19.6% of infected ticks. Globally, 34.2% of ticks were infected with at least one pathogen. The diversity of tick-borne pathogens detected in I. ricinus in this study and the frequency of coinfections underline the need to take them seriously into consideration when evaluating the risks of infection following a tick bite."

Multiple inflammatory cells and molecules are involved. Among the latter, the Nuclear Factor -\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) has been found to be most important and present in all cell types. NF-B regulates the expression of a large number of genes involved in inflammation. NF-\u03baB plays a key role in the orchestration of the multifaceted inflammatory response, not only in the first pro-inflammatory phase, but also later in the regulation of the resolution of inflammation, when anti-inflammatory genes are expressed and apoptosis is induced. The review describes NF-\u03baB and its two pathways: the canonical, mediated by the p65 and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical, mediated by the subunits RelB, p52 and p50. The relevance of the kinases and interactions leading to NF-\u03baB activation is considered in different primary cells (i.e. macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, cells from inflammatory tissues), together with the response induced and the ligand involved. Then we overview the different steps to NF-B activation that can be targeted (IKKs, I\u03baB\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB subunits themselves) with various technologies available i.e. small molecules peptides or nucleic acids. A rationale is provided for possible targets to consider, in the light that NF-\u03baB signaling pathways regulates both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. The possibility of using NF-\u03baB targeted dendritic cells in immunotherapy is considered."

Rat isolated intrapulmonary arterial rings contracted with 8 nmol/L endothelin-1 were relaxed by 10 nmol/L ambrisentan and 30 nmol/L tadalafil alone by 26\u00b13% and 21\u00b11%, respectively, whereas both drugs in combination acted synergistically to relax arterial rings by 83\u00b16%.

Denudation of endothelium from pulmonary arterial rings abolished the vasodilator response to 30 nmol/L tadalafil and the synergistic vasorelaxant effect of tadalafil with ambrisentan. In the presence of 1 \u03bcmol/L BQ-788, a selective endothelin type B receptor antagonist, the vasorelaxant effects of 10 nmol/L ambrisentan and 30 nmol/L tadalafil were additive but not synergistic. These data can be interpreted to suggest that ambrisentan and tadalafil synergistically inhibit endothelin-1-induced constriction of rat intrapulmonary arteries and that endothelin type B receptors in endothelium are necessary to enable a synergistic vasorelaxant effect of the drug combination."

For this reason, PLN is one of the major determinants of cardiac contractility and relaxation. In this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology. We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a and its role in the regulation of the mechanic and the electric performance of the heart under basal conditions, in the presence of chemical and physical stresses, such as \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, response to stretch, force-frequency relationship and intracellular acidosis. Our aim is to provide the basis to discuss the role of PLN also on the cardiac function of nonmammalian vertebrates, because so far this aspect has been almost neglected. Accordingly, when possible, the literature on PLN will be analysed taking into account the nonuniform cardiac structural and functional characteristics encountered in ectothermic vertebrates, such as the peculiar and variable organization of the SR, the large spectrum of response to stresses and the disaptive absence of crucial proteins (i.e. haemoglobinless and myoglobinless species)."

New molecules have been developped which target specifically the thyroid hormone receptor ss, predominant isoform in liver. The first thyroid hormone agonist, called GC1, has selective actions compared to T3. In animals, GC1 reduced serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides, probably by stimulation important steps in reverse cholesterol transport. Other selective thyromimetic, KB- 2115 and KB - 141 have similar effects. Another class of thyroid hormone analogs, the thyronamines have emerged recently but the basic biology of this new class of endogenous thyroid hormone remains to better understood. Therefore, these molecules may be a potentially treatment for obesity and reduction cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). To date the studies in human are preliminary. Tolerance and efficacy of these drugs are still under investigation."

Flavin-based fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) address two major limitations associated with existing fluorescent reporters derived from the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-namely, the overall large size and oxygen-dependent maturation of fluorescence of GFP. However, FbFPs are at a nascent stage of development and have been utilized in only a handful of biological studies. Importantly, a full understanding of the performance and properties of FbFPs as a practical set of biological probes is lacking. In this work, we extensively characterize three FbFPs isolated from Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Arabidopsis thaliana, using in vitro studies to assess probe brightness, oligomeric state, maturation time, fraction of fluorescent holoprotein, pH tolerance, redox sensitivity, and thermal stability. Furthermore, we validate FbFPs as stable molecular tags using in vivo studies by constructing a series of FbFP-based transcriptional constructs to probe promoter activity in Escherichia coli. Overall, FbFPs show key advantages as broad-spectrum biological reporters including robust pH tolerance (4-11), thermal stability (up to 60\u00b0C), and rapid maturation of fluorescence (<3 min.). In addition, the FbFP derived from Arabidopsis thaliana (iLOV) emerged as a stable and nonperturbative reporter of promoter activity in Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that FbFP-based reporters have the potential to address key limitations associated with the use of GFP, such as pH-sensitive fluorescence and slow kinetics of fluorescence maturation (10-40 minutes for half maximal fluorescence recovery). From this view, FbFPs represent a useful new addition to the fluorescent reporter protein palette, and our results constitute an important framework to enable researchers to implement and further engineer improved FbFP-based reporters with enhanced brightness and tighter flavin binding, which will maximize their potential benefits."

The statistical power of these iPSC-based models, however, is dependent on accurate diagnoses of the somatic cell donors; unfortunately, many neurodegenerative diseases are commonly misdiagnosed in live human subjects. Postmortem histopathological examination of a donor's brain, combined with premortem clinical criteria, is often the most robust approach to correctly classify an individual as a disease-specific case or unaffected control. In this study, we describe iPSCs generated from a skin biopsy collected postmortem during the rapid autopsy of a 75-year-old male, whole body donor, defined as an unaffected neurological control by both clinical and histopathological criteria. These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Selected iPSC clones expressed both nuclear and surface antigens recognized as pluripotency markers of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and were able to differentiate in vitro into neurons and glia. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that fibroblast proliferation was significantly affected by biopsy site, but not donor age (within an elderly cohort). These results provide evidence that autopsy donor-derived fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs, and may provide an advantageous approach for generating iPSC-based neurological disease models."

Surgery is the first choice for chordoma treatment, followed by radiotherapy, although postoperative complications remain significant. Recurrence of the disease occurs frequently due to the anatomy of the tumor location and violation of the tumor margins at the initial surgery. Currently, there are no effective drugs available for patients with chordoma. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited opportunity to test agents in clinical trials and no concerted effort to develop agents for chordoma in the pharmaceutical industry. To rapidly and efficiently identify small molecules that inhibit chordoma cell growth, we screened the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) containing approximately 2800 clinically approved and investigational drugs at 15 different concentrations in chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2. We identified a group of drugs including bortezomib, 17-AAG, digitoxin, staurosporine, digoxin, rubitecan, and trimetrexate that inhibited chordoma cell growth, with potencies from 10 to 370 nM in U-CH1 cells, but less potently in U-CH2 cells. Most of these drugs also induced caspase 3/7 activity with a similar rank order as the cytotoxic effect on U-CH1 cells. Cantharidin, digoxin, digitoxin, staurosporine, and bortezomib showed similar inhibitory effect on cell lines and 3 primary chordoma cell cultures. The combination treatment of bortezomib with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors increased the therapeutic potency in U-CH2 and patient-derived primary cultures. Our results provide information useful for repurposing currently approved drugs for chordoma and potential approach of combination therapy. "

FUS is a predominantly nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that is involved in RNA processing. Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration."

The side effects can be relatively common, including proliferative skin toxicities. The latter range from hyperkeratosis and keratoacanthomas (KAs) to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and new primary melanomas. In addition, case reports on the emergence of gastric/colonic polyps and RAS mutant malignancies have been described during BRAF inhibitor therapy. These events have been attributed to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to selective BRAF inhibitors in addition to increased RAS activity. Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition appears to improve clinical outcomes and reduce cutaneous proliferation events as fewer KAs and SCCs have been observed with combination therapy. Next-generation pan-RAF inhibitors ('paradox breakers') and ERK inhibitors may further enhance clinical activity in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma patients and mitigate this paradoxical oncogenesis. Further investigation into the potential long-term effects of selective BRAF inhibitors is warranted as expanded use of these agents is expected in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and other malignancies.

In most carcinomas, transcriptional repression has emerged as the main mechanism responsible for E-cadherin downregulation. Here, we report the identification of class I bHLH factor E2-2 (TCF4/ITF2) as a new EMT regulator. Both isoforms of E2-2 (E2-2A and E2-2B) induce a full EMT when overexpressed in MDCK cells but without affecting the tumorigenic properties of parental cells, in contrast to other EMT inducers, such as Snail1 or class I bHLH E47. E-cadherin repression mediated by E2-2 is indirect and independent of proximal E-boxes of the promoter. Knockdown studies indicate that E2-2 expression is dispensable for maintenance of the EMT driven by Snail1 and E47. Comparative gene-profiling analysis reveals that E2-2 factors induce similar, yet distinct, genetic programs to that induced by E47 in MDCK cells. These results, together with the embryonic expression pattern of Tcf4 and E2A (which encodes E12/E47), support a distinct role for E2-2 and suggest an interesting interplay between E-cadherin repressors in the regulation of physiological and pathological EMT processes."

Most patients defend a temporarily lowered temperature \"set point\" during episodes of hypothermia, despite manifesting many well-known systemic consequences of core temperature hypothermia. No case of death directly attributable to an episode of spontaneous periodic hypothermia has been reported, although many of the serious systemic effects of hypothermia have been documented in these cases, so it is not unlikely that death may occur. The syndrome's cause, and that of Shapiro syndrome, remains unknown. Pharmacologic trials to date have been only modestly successful. Anticonvulsant agents, clonidine, and cyproheptadine appear the most likely to succeed, with cyproheptadine being a reasonable first choice. Given that the term \"spontaneous periodic hypothermia\" describes a syndrome, and not a pathophysiologic mechanism, it is likely to encompass a common eventuality, arrived at via several different pathways. One can postulate mechanisms such as structural abnormalities, trauma, infection, irritation, and degeneration involving strategic locations which create a focus for epileptic or other periodic dysfunction whose scope involves the centers for thermoregulation. The existence of 2 distinct, oppositional thermoregulatory centers would allow for speculation of similar mechanisms accounting for cases of both periodic hypo- and hyperthermia (61). Postmortem data regarding the hypothalamic and surrounding areas from future cases of Shapiro syndrome and spontaneous periodic hypothermia would be of great interest. Further, more sensitive in vivo testing methods are clearly needed. The role of PET or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m-labeled hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (Tc 99m HMPAO) performed acutely during an episode remains to be characterized (64, 103, 105). The term \"diencephalic epilepsy\" may in fact be accurate, given the periodic episodes of the case presented here and similar cases resulting from non-generalized seizure activity, with or without an underlying predisposing lesion. The label diencephalic epilepsy has been merely speculative so far, however, as definitive evidence of seizure activity has not been documented. Further, it is expected that the descriptive terms \"spontaneous periodic hypothermia\" and \"episodic spontaneous hypothermia with hyperhidrosis\" will outlive their usefulness as researchers gain greater understanding of this syndrome, and be replaced with a more pathophysiologically meaningful nomenclature."

They have an active role in genetic variation, adaptation and evolution through the duplication or deletion of genes or their regulatory elements, and transposable elements themselves can act as alternative promoters for nearby genes, resulting in non-canonical regulation of transcription. However, transposable element activity can lead to detrimental genome instability, and hosts have evolved mechanisms to silence transposable element mobility appropriately. Recent studies have demonstrated that a subset of transposable elements, endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) containing long terminal repeats (LTRs), are silenced through trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by ESET (also known as SETDB1 or KMT1E) and a co-repressor complex containing KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1; also known as TRIM28) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we show that the replacement histone variant H3.3 is enriched at class I and class II ERVs, notably those of the early transposon (ETn)/MusD family and intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs). Deposition at a subset of these elements is dependent upon the H3.3 chaperone complex containing \u03b1-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX). We demonstrate that recruitment of DAXX, H3.3 and KAP1 to ERVs is co-dependent and occurs upstream of ESET, linking H3.3 to ERV-associated H3K9me3. Importantly, H3K9me3 is reduced at ERVs upon H3.3 deletion, resulting in derepression and dysregulation of adjacent, endogenous genes, along with increased retrotransposition of IAPs. Our study identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells.

Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome is caused by mutations in any of the genes encoding TREX1, RNASEH2-A, -B, -C and SAMHD1, with protein dysfunction hypothesized to result in the accumulation of nucleic acids within the cell, thus triggering an autoinflammatory response with increased interferon-\u03b1 production. Astrocytes have been identified as a major source of interferon-\u03b1 production in the brains of patients with Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. Here, we study the effect of interferon-\u03b1 treatment on astrocytes derived from immortalized human neural stem cells. Chronic interferon-\u03b1 treatment promoted astrocyte activation and a reduction in cell proliferation. Moreover, chronic exposure resulted in an alteration of genes and proteins involved in the stability of white matter (ATF4, eIF2B\u03b1, cathepsin D, cystatin F), an increase of antigen-presenting genes (human leukocyte antigen class I) and downregulation of pro-angiogenic factors and other cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-1). Interestingly, withdrawal of interferon-\u03b1 for 7 days barely reversed these cellular alterations, demonstrating that the interferon-\u03b1 mediated effects persist over time. We confirmed our in vitro findings using brain samples from patients with Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. Our results support the idea of interferon-\u03b1 as a key factor in the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome relating to the observed leukodystrophy and microangiopathy. Because of the sustained interferon-\u03b1 effect, even after withdrawal, therapeutic targets for Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, and other interferon-\u03b1-mediated encephalopathies, may include downstream interferon-\u03b1 signalling cascade effectors rather than interferon-\u03b1 alone."

Three planktonic Geobacter-dominated samples were obtained from two wells down-gradient of acetate addition. Over 2,500 proteins from each of these samples were identified by matching liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry spectra to peptides predicted from seven isolate Geobacter genomes. Genome-specific peptides indicate early proliferation of multiple M21 and Geobacter bemidjiensis-like strains and later possible emergence of M21 and G. bemidjiensis-like strains more closely related to Geobacter lovleyi. Throughout biostimulation, the proteome is dominated by enzymes that convert acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A and pyruvate for central metabolism, while abundant peptides matching tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins and ATP synthase subunits were also detected, indicating the importance of energy generation during the period of rapid growth following the start of biostimulation. Evolving Geobacter strain composition may be linked to changes in protein abundance over the course of biostimulation and may reflect changes in metabolic functioning. Thus, metagenomics-independent community proteogenomics can be used to diagnose the status of the subsurface consortia upon which remediation biotechnology relies."

Major signaling pathways regulated by RIP1 include necroptosis, apoptosis, and pro-survival/inflammation NF-\u03baB activation. Previous studies show that RIP1 deficiency has no effect on mouse embryogenesis, but blocks postnatal development. This phenotype could not readily be explained, since mice lacking TNFR1, Fas, or TLRs show no apparent developmental defect. Certain types of RIP1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. However, in our previous study, deletion of the apoptotic adaptor protein, FADD, provides marginal improvement of postnatal development of rip1 (-/-) mice. Remarkably, the current data shows that haploid insufficiency of RIP3, a known mediator of necroptosis, allowed survival of rip1 (-/-) fadd (-/-) mice beyond weaning age, although the resulting rip1(-/-)fadd(-/-) rip3(+/-) mice were significant smaller in size and weight. Moreover, complete absence of RIP3 further improved postnatal development of the resulting rip1 (-/-) fadd (-/-) rip3 (-/-) mice, which display normal size and weight. In such triple knockout (TKO) mice, lymphocytes underwent normal development, but progressively accumulated as mice age. This lymphoproliferative (lpr) disease in TKO mice is, however, less severe than that of fadd(-/-)rip3 (-/-) double knockout mice. In total, the data show that the postnatal developmental defect in rip1 (-/-) mice is due in part to FADD-mediated apoptosis as well as RIP3-dependent necroptosis. Moreover, the function of RIP1 contributes to development of lpr diseases. "

Not surprisingly, mutations in Notch receptors and ligands have been linked to a variety of hereditary diseases that impact both the heart and the vasculature. In particular, mutations in the gene encoding the human Notch ligand jagged 1 result in a multisystem autosomal dominant disorder called Alagille syndrome, which includes tetralogy of Fallot among its more severe cardiac pathologies. Jagged 1 is expressed throughout the developing embryo, particularly in endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome. Mutant mice display right ventricular hypertrophy, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defects, coronary vessel abnormalities and valve defects. Examination of mid-gestational embryos revealed that the loss of Jag1, similar to the loss of Notch1, disrupts endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition during endocardial cushion formation. Furthermore, adult mutant mice exhibit cardiac valve calcifications associated with abnormal matrix remodeling and induction of bone morphogenesis. This work shows that the endothelium is responsible for the wide spectrum of cardiac phenotypes displayed in Alagille Syndrome and it demonstrates a crucial role for Jag1 in valve morphogenesis."

To locate determinants for sorting of gp210 to the pore membrane, we constructed various cDNAs coding for wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gp210, and monitored localization of the expressed protein in 3T3 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. The large cisternal domain of gp210 (95% of its mass) did not reveal any sorting determinants. Surprisingly, the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The CT also contains a sorting determinant, but it is weaker than that of the TM. We propose specific lateral association of the transmembrane helices of two proteins to yield either a gp210 homodimer or a heterodimer of gp210 and another protein. The cytoplasmically oriented tails of these dimers may bind cooperatively to the adjacent NPCs.

Because UGA also functions as a signal for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we have investigated how the rates of translational termination and selenocysteine incorporation relate to cis-acting elements in the mRNA as well as to trans-acting factors in the cytoplasm. We used cis-elements from the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase gene as the basis for this work because of its relatively high efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation. The last two codons preceding the UGA were found to exert a far greater influence on selenocysteine incorporation than nucleotides downstream of it. The efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation was generally much less than 100% but could be partially enhanced by concomitant overexpression of the tRNA(Sec) gene. The combination of two or three UGA codons in one reading frame led to a dramatic reduction in the yield of full-length protein. It is therefore unlikely that multiple incorporations of selenocysteine are processive with respect to the mode of action of the ribosomal complex binding to the UGA site. These observations are discussed in terms of the mechanism of selenoprotein synthesis and its ability to compete with termination at UGA codons."

We do this by identifying dinucleotide biases in the coding regions of innate immune response genes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and then use this signal to identify other significant host innate immune genes. The persistence of these biases in the orthologous groups of genes in humans and chickens is also examined. We then compare the significant motifs in highly expressed genes of the innate immune system to those in ssRNA viruses and study the evolution of these motifs in the H1N1 influenza genome. We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context--which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans--is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes.

Acetylation of the \u03b5-amino group of Lys-40 of \u03b1-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules. Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions. "

Previous studies revealed that the overexpression of some A3 proteins could restrict engineered human Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition in HeLa cells. However, whether endogenous A3 proteins play a role in restricting L1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that HeLa cells express endogenous A3B and A3C, whereas human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) express A3B, A3C, A3DE, A3F, and A3G. To study the relative contribution of endogenous A3 proteins in restricting L1 retrotransposition, we first generated small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to suppress endogenous A3 mRNA expression, and then assessed L1 mobility using a cell-based L1 retrotransposition assay. We demonstrate that in both HeLa and hESCs, shRNA-based knockdown of A3B promotes a \u223c2-3.7-fold increase in the retrotransposition efficiency of an engineered human L1. Knockdown of the other A3s produced no significant increase in L1 activity. Thus, A3B appears to restrict engineered L1 retrotransposition in a broad range of cell types, including pluripotent cells."

We implemented, PPInterFinder--a web-based text mining tool to extract human PPIs from biomedical literature. PPInterFinder uses relation keyword co-occurrences with protein names to extract information on PPIs from MEDLINE abstracts and consists of three phases. First, it identifies the relation keyword using a parser with Tregex and a relation keyword dictionary. Next, it automatically identifies the candidate PPI pairs with a set of rules related to PPI recognition. Finally, it extracts the relations by matching the sentence with a set of 11 specific patterns based on the syntactic nature of PPI pair. We find that PPInterFinder is capable of predicting PPIs with the accuracy of 66.05% on AIMED corpus and outperforms most of the existing systems.

Currently it is usually given in a combination with leucovorin and oxaliplatin, i.e. FOLFOX, or irinotecan, i.e. FOLFIRI, or all three, i.e. FOLFIRINOX, but gradually it has been replaced by oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug formulations, such as tegafur-uracil and S-1 (both contain ftorafur), and capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae). Novel drugs such as the antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, and the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, cetuximab, are often combined with one of these treatment options. However, when resistance emerged, no alternatives were available. TAS-102, a combination of trifluorothymidine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor TPI in a 1:0.5 ratio, is a novel oral formulation, which is active in 5FU-resistant models, both in vitro and in xenograft models. In addition to inhibition of thymidylate synthase, the major mechanism of action of classical fluoropyrimidines, TAS-102's major mechanism of action is incorporation into DNA, thereby causing DNA damage. TAS-102 also follows an alternative activation pathway via thymidine kinase, and is not a substrate for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. All together this explains the efficacy in 5FU-resistant models. In early clinical studies, the twice-daily schedule (5 days on, 2 days rest) for 2 weeks every 4 weeks, led to a significant disease control rate in various malignancies. This schedule showed consistent activity in two randomized trials on fluoropyrimidine refractory colorectal cancer patients, reflected by an increase of 2-3 months in overall survival in the TAS-102 group compared with placebo. Considering the impressive preclinical potential of various combinations TAS-102 has the promise to become an alternative for 5FU-resistant cancer. "

In a subset of patients, hospitalization and even intubation are required for airway protection. The diagnosis is made clinically. There are no laboratory studies that establish the diagnosis. However, such investigations help exclude alternative diagnoses as the cause for the patient's presentation. Conventional treatment with regimens used to control allergic angioedema is ineffective in this condition. The mechanism of ACEI-induced angioedema is thought to be related to its effect on the kallikrein-kinin system. Kallikrein is a protease that converts high-molecular-weight kininogens into kinins, primarily bradykinin. Medications recently developed, primarily icatibant and ecallantide, to control hereditary angioedema, a disorder also associated with kallikrein-kinin activation, have been used to treat ACEI angioedema with some success. The efficacy of these agents and their optimal use remains to be established by randomized and placebo controlled trials. "

This disease process continues postnatally in endochondral bone growth center malformation and malfunction as well as ectopic cartilage ossification in soft tissues.

In a recent trial, afamelanotide administered as controlled release implants protected erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) patients from sunlight induced phototoxic skin reactions. Administration of biological therapeutic peptides may elicit unwanted immunogenic responses in recipients of these products. Although in a previous study using ELISA technique we excluded any newly developed immunogenicity during prolonged exposure to afamelanotide, we confirmed the previously published existence of low titers of antibodies against \u03b1-MSH in drug-na\u00efve individuals that cross-reacted with afamelanotide. In order to investigate whether such antibodies are neutralizing, i.e. could block the biological effect of afamelanotide, we developed a cell culture-based bioassay. The basis of our assay was the measurement of afamelanotide-induced cAMP formation in a strain of the B16 mouse melanoma cell line, G4F-7, expressing the transfected human MC1R. Average half-effective concentrations of the natural hormone \u03b1-MSH and its congener afamelanotide were 38.8 \u00b1 10.6 and 10.9 \u00b1 7.17 nM (n=5), respectively. Neutralizing antibodies would reduce the cAMP formation. Two neutralizing anti-\u03b1-MSH antibodies served as positive controls. cAMP formation in the G4F-7 cells after addition of sera of drug-na\u00efve (n=6) and of drug-exposed EPP patients (n=17) was significantly lower than after that from healthy volunteers (n=13). There was no difference between drug-na\u00efve and drug-exposed patients. Using forskolin as a hormone-independent stimulator of cAMP formation, we excluded an unspecific interference of EPP sera with cAMP formation. We conclude that afamelanotide even after prolonged application to EPP patients did not elicit neutralizing antibodies. Further, the low titer immunoreactivity observed in sera of some drug-na\u00efve individuals had no effect on the biological activity of afamelanotide."

Recent publications on a class of pimelic diphenylamide HDAC inhibitors have highlighted their promise in the treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich's ataxia and Huntington's disease, based on efficacy in cell and mouse models. These studies' authors have proposed that the unique action of these compounds compared to hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors results from their unusual slow-on/slow-off kinetics of binding, preferentially to HDAC3, resulting in a distinctive pharmacological profile and reduced toxicity. Here, we evaluate the HDAC subtype selectivity, cellular activity, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties, as well as the central pharmacodynamic profile of one such compound, HDACi 4b, previously described to show efficacy in vivo in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease. Based on our data reported here, we conclude that while the in vitro selectivity and binding mode are largely in agreement with previous reports, the physicochemical properties, metabolic and p-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate liability of HDACi 4b render this compound suboptimal to investigate central Class I HDAC inhibition in vivo in mouse per oral administration. A drug administration regimen using HDACi 4b dissolved in drinking water was used in the previous proof of concept study, casting doubt on the validation of CNS HDAC3 inhibition as a target for the treatment of Huntington's disease. We highlight physicochemical stability and metabolic issues with 4b that are likely intrinsic liabilities of the benzamide chemotype in general."

We have exploited the PTS to selectively deliver a polyamine-containing drug to cancer cells. F14512 combines an epipodophyllotoxin core-targeting topoisomerase II with a spermine moiety introduced as a cell delivery vector. The polyamine tail supports three complementary functions: (a) facilitate formulation of a water-soluble compound, (b) increase DNA binding to reinforce topoisomerase II inhibition, and (c) facilitate selective uptake by tumor cells via the PTS. F14512 is 73-fold more cytotoxic to Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with CHO-MG cells with a reduced PTS activity. A decreased sensitivity of L1210 leukemia cells to F14512 was observed in the presence of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. In parallel, the spermine moiety considerably enhances the drug-DNA interaction, leading to a reinforced inhibition of topoisomerase II. The spermine tail of F14512 serves as a cell delivery vehicle as well as a DNA anchor, and this property translates at the cellular level into a distinct pharmacologic profile. Twenty-nine human solid or hematologic cell lines were used to characterize the high cytotoxic potential of F14512 (median IC50 of 0.18 micromol/L). Finally, the potent antitumor activity of F14512 in vivo was evidenced with a MX1 human breast tumor xenograft model, with partial and complete tumor regressions. This work supports the clinical development of F14512 as a novel targeted cytotoxic drug and sheds light on the concept of selective delivery of drugs to tumor cells expressing the PTS."

Although all organisms have evolved mechanisms of defense against oxidative damage, little is known about these mechanisms in nonenteric bacteria, including pseudomonads. Here we have studied the involvement of oxidized guanine (GO) repair enzymes and DNA-protecting enzyme Dps in the avoidance of mutations in starving Pseudomonas putida. Additionally, we examined possible connections between the oxidative damage of DNA and involvement of the error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol)V homologue RulAB in stationary-phase mutagenesis in P. putida. Our results demonstrated that the GO repair enzymes MutY, MutM, and MutT are involved in the prevention of base substitution mutations in carbon-starved P. putida. Interestingly, the antimutator effect of MutT was dependent on the growth phase of bacteria. Although the lack of MutT caused a strong mutator phenotype under carbon starvation conditions for bacteria, only a twofold increased effect on the frequency of mutations was observed for growing bacteria. This indicates that MutT has a backup system which efficiently complements the absence of this enzyme in actively growing cells. The knockout of MutM affected only the spectrum of mutations but did not change mutation frequency. Dps is known to protect DNA from oxidative damage. We found that dps-defective P. putida cells were more sensitive to sudden exposure to hydrogen peroxide than wild-type cells. At the same time, the absence of Dps did not affect the accumulation of mutations in populations of starved bacteria. Thus, it is possible that the protective role of Dps becomes essential for genome integrity only when bacteria are exposed to exogenous agents that lead to oxidative DNA damage but not under physiological conditions. Introduction of the Y family DNA polymerase PolV homologue rulAB into P. putida increased the proportion of A-to-C and A-to-G base substitutions among mutations, which occurred under starvation conditions. Since PolV is known to perform translesion synthesis past damaged bases in DNA (e.g., some oxidized forms of adenine), our results may imply that adenine oxidation products are also an important source of mutation in starving bacteria."

On the other hand, unsupervised segmentation methods need no prior knowledge and lead to low performance. However, semi-supervised learning which uses not only a few labeled data, but also a large amount of unlabeled data promises higher accuracy with less effort. In this paper, we propose a new interactive semi-supervised approach to segmentation of suspicious lesions in breast MRI. Using a suitable classifier in this approach has an important role in its performance; in this paper, we present a semi-supervised algorithm improved self-training (IMPST) which is an improved version of self-training method and increase segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that performance of segmentation in this approach is higher than supervised and unsupervised methods such as K nearest neighbors, Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, and Fuzzy c-Means."

In prokaryotes, the biochemical function of FtsZ is thought to underpin the assembly and at least the initial kinetic force of ring contraction. Our model extends earlier work of Surovtsev et al.

Moreover, we provide a more rigorous treatment of intracellular diffusion and we revise some of the model parameter values in light of the experimental evidence now available. We derive a critical contraction parameter which links the chemical population dynamics of membrane-bound FtsZ molecules to the force of contraction. Using this parameter as a tool to predict the ability of the cell to initiate division, we are able to predict the division outcome in cells depleted of key FtsZ-binding proteins."

We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age.

The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria. Bacillus anthracis is one of the MutH-less Gram(+) bacteria in the phylum of Firmicutes. We used papillation as a tool to search for B. anthracis new mutator strains and identified a spontaneous mutator that carries a minitransposon insertion in the BAS4289 locus. The mutational frequency and specificity exhibited in this mutant were comparable to that of MMR-deficient strains with knockouts of mutL or mutS. It retained a similar UV sensitivity profile as that of the wild type. BAS4289 encodes a putative DNA helicase RecD2 that shares 30% sequence identity with Deinococcus radiodurans RecD2, a well characterized superfamily 1B helicase whose homologs are widely present in Firmicutes complete genomes. We demonstrated that the N-terminal region of RecD2, a unique sequence extension used to distinguish RecD2 from RecD1, was important for B. anthracis RecD2, as mutations in the N-terminal conserved motifs affected its DNA repair function. This is the first report of a RecD2 helicase being associated with MMR. RecD2 and our recently described YycJ protein are likely to be two additional components in the B. anthracis MutH-independent MMR system."

Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members: mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKC\u03b1 (protein kinase C\u03b1) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2 components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKC\u03b1 at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1 knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney."

This review summarizes our understanding, accumulated during the last 20 years, on the genetics, biochemistry, cytology and physiology of the five pSM19035 segregation (seg) loci, which map outside of the minimal replicon. The segA locus plays a role both in maximizing plasmid random segregation, and in avoiding replication fork collapses in those plasmids with long inverted repeated regions. The segB1 locus, which acts as the ultimate determinant of plasmid maintenance, encodes a short-lived epsilon(2) antitoxin protein and a long-lived zeta toxin protein, which form a complex that neutralizes zeta toxicity. The cells that do not receive a copy of the plasmid halt their proliferation upon decay of the epsilon(2) antitoxin. The segB2 locus, which encodes two trans-acting, ParA- and ParB-like proteins and six cis-acting parS centromeres, actively ensures equal or roughly equal distribution of plasmid copies to daughter cells. The segC locus includes functions that promote the shift from the use of DNA polymerase I to the replicase (PolC-PolE DNA polymerases). The segD locus, which encodes a trans-acting transcriptional repressor, omega(2), and six cis-acting cognate sites, coordinates the expression of genes that control copy number, better-than-random segregation and partition, and assures the proper balance of these different functions. Working in concert the five different loci achieve almost absolute plasmid maintenance with a minimal growth penalty."

However, it remains unclear whether T3 directly modulates underlying gene transcription and which thyroid receptor (TR) isoform might be responsible for gene transactivation. To clarify this situation, we analysed the role of T3 and its receptors alpha1 (TRalpha1) and beta1 (TRbeta1) in regulation of KCNA4, KCND2, KCND3 and KCNIP2 transcription in rat cardiomyocytes. Initial results demonstrated a T3-mediated increase of I(to) current density. T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected. To dissect the role of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 in T3-dependent I(to) modulation, TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 were overexpressed in cardiomyocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. To further evaluate a possible direct interaction of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 with the KCND3 promoter, TR expression vectors were cotransfected with a construct containing 2335 bp of the KCND3 5'-flanking sequence linked to a luciferase reporter into ventricular myocytes. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible promoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter sequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start site. Disruption of putative TR binding sites by mutagenesis abolished the TRalpha1- (G-1651T) and TRbeta1- (G-73T) mediated effects, indicating that TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 response elements map to different regions of the KCND3 promoter. Thus, I(to) is modulated by diverse T3-dependent regulation of underlying gene transcription. TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 exhibit distinct effects on KCND3 transactivation with TRalpha1 enhancing and TRbeta1 suppressing KCND3 transcription."

Apoptotic cells were identified by means of an in situ detection assay for nuclear DNA fragmentation using a modified TUNEL procedure and by electron microscopical examination for typical morphological features of programmed cell death. TUNEL-positive cells were frequently detected in samples distracted at higher strain magnitudes. Ultrastructurally, these apoptotic cells displayed a condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei, while the continuity of their plasma membranes remained intact. Our results clearly indicated that the discontinuous traction of osteotomized mandibles induced enhanced apoptosis. In contrast to non-distracted samples and mandibles distracted at low strain magnitudes, in which only minimal evidence of apoptotic cell death was detected, the application of hyperphysiological strain magnitudes resulted in an increased apoptosis rate. Thus, mechanical loading seems to be a triggering factor for apoptotic changes in osteoblastic cells. These findings suggest a pathophysiological role of apoptotic cell death in the control of tissue integrity during distraction osteogenesis."

HIV-1 Vif (viral infectivity factor) binds A3 proteins and targets these proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As such, the therapeutic blockage of Vif-A3 interaction is predicted to stimulate natural antiviral activity by rescuing APOBEC expression and virion packaging. In this study, we describe a successful application of the Protein Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) based on the enzyme TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase to study Vif-A3 interactions. PCA is based on the interaction between two protein binding partners (e.g., Vif and A3G), which are fused to the two halves of a dissected marker protein (\u03b2-lactamase). Binding of the two partners reassembles \u03b2-lactamase and hence reconstitutes its activity. To validate our assay, we studied the effect of well-described Vif (DRMR, YRHHY) and A3G (D128K) mutations on the interaction between the two proteins. Additionally, we studied the interaction of human Vif with other members of the A3 family: A3F and APOBEC3C (A3C). Our results demonstrate the applicability of PCA as a simple and reliable technique for the assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Furthermore, when compared with co-immunoprecipitation assays, PCA appeared to be a more sensitive technique for the quantitative assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Thus, with our results, we conclude that PCA could be used to quantitatively study specific domains that may be involved in the interaction between Vif and APOBEC proteins."

Crystallographic analysis of complexes formed by HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI), AdoMet and a target oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing 5-fluorocytosine confirmed the existence of this dihydrocytosine intermediate. Based on the premise that 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine (DZCyt), a cytosine analog with an sp3-hybridized carbon (CH2) at position 6 and an NH group at position 5, could mimic the non-aromatic character of the cytosine ring in this transition state, we synthesized a series of synthetic substrates for DNA C5-MTase containing DZCyt. Substitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase. Substitution of DZCyt for the target cytosine in G-C-G-C sites in double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides had a similar effect on methylation by M. HhaI. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine. Crystallographic analysis of a ternary complex involving M.HhaI, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and a double-stranded 13-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing DZCyt at the target position showed that the analog is flipped out of the DNA helix in the same manner as cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and 5-fluorocytosine. However, no formation of a covalent bond was detected between the sulfur atom of the catalytic site nucleophile, cysteine 81, and the pyrimidine C6 carbon. These results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation."

Among the 6 520 long-distance chromatin interactions, we identify 2 067 enhancers that interact with 1 619 promoters and enhance their expression. These enhancers exist in accessible chromatin regions and are associated with various histone modifications and polymerase II binding. The promoters with interacting enhancers are expressed at higher levels than those without interacting enhancers, and their expression levels are positively correlated with the number of interacting enhancers. Interestingly, interacting promoters are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We also find that chromosomes are organized into multiple levels of interacting domains. Our results define a global view of EP interactions and provide a data set to further understand mechanisms of enhancer targeting and long-range chromatin organization.

Critical factors in NMD include Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3, as well as the decapping enzyme, Dcp2/Dcp1. Loss of Upf2 or Upf3 leads to the accumulation of not only Upf1 and Dcp2 in P-bodies, but also of the decapping-activators Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1. An interaction between Upf1 and Dcp2 has been identified, which might recruit Dcp2 to the NMD decapping complex. To determine the nature and significance of the Dcp2-Upf1 interaction, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay to assess Upf1 interactions with various mRNA decapping factors. We find that although Dcp2 can interact with Upf1, this interaction is indirect and is largely dependent on the Edc3 protein, which interacts with the N-terminal domain of Upf1 at an overlapping, but not identical, site as Upf2. We also found that Pat1 has an independent two-hybrid interaction with the N-terminus of Upf1. Assessment of both reporter and endogenous NMD transcripts suggest that the decapping stimulators, including Edc3 and Pat1, as well as Edc1 and Edc2, are not essential for NMD under normal conditions. This work defines a larger decapping complex involved in NMD, but indicates that components of that complex are not required for general NMD and might either regulate a subset of NMD transcripts or be essential for proper NMD under different environmental conditions."

Localization of PR-Set7 to mitotic chromosomes and subsequent increase in H4 Lys 20 methylation were inversely correlated to transient H4 Lys 16 acetylation in early S-phase.

Several explanations for this failure to detect mutations have been proposed, including genetic heterogeneity, failure of allele expression, and technical difficulties. Genetic heterogeneity has been confirmed as an explanation for such failure, since causative mutations have been identified in the COL5A1, COL5A2, and tenascin X genes and since they have been inferred in the COL1A2 gene. Nonetheless, in the majority of families with autosomal dominant inheritance of EDS, there appears to be linkage to loci that contain the COL5A1 or COL5A2 genes. To determine whether allele-product instability could explain failure to identify some mutations, we analyzed polymorphic variants in the COL5A1 gene in 16 individuals, and we examined mRNA for the expression of both alleles and for alterations in splicing. We found a splice-site mutation in a single individual, and we determined that, in six individuals, the mRNA from one COL5A1 allele either was not expressed or was very unstable. We identified small insertions or deletions in five of these cell strains, but we could not identify the mutation in the sixth individual. Thus, although as many as one-half of the mutations that give rise to EDS types I and II are likely to lie in the COL5A1 gene, a significant portion of them result in very low levels of mRNA from the mutant allele, as a consequence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay."

Antagonism of these proinflammatory cytokines has been recognized as an effective possibility for the development of new drug candidates. The characterization of the pharmacological profile displayed by the selective p38 inhibitor prototype SB203580, proved its disease-modifying activity in the adjuvantinduced arthritis model. This strongly suggests that adequate modulation of production of these cytokines can bring significant benefits to the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases. In addition to its important role for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, p38 is also involved in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and the induction of COX- 2 transcription, proteins that are involved in the process of tissue destruction and inflammation. Because of its multiple functions in modulating the inflammatory response, it is expected that p38 inhibiting drugs will treat the underlying cause of chronic inflammatory diseases and stop their progression. The archetypal small molecule p38 inhibitors are the pyridinylimidazoles and these structures formed the basis for much of the early research. More recently a number of nonimidazole based p38 inhibitors such as the ureas, pyrazoles, pyrazoloheteroaryls, pyridazines, indoles, amides, pyridines, triazolopyridines, etc containing a variety of functionality have been reported to inhibit cytokine activity. This article provides a critical account of these different heterocycles reported for p38 MAPK inhibition and covers the recent research in the development of anti inflammatory agents. "

Mean seizure frequency during baseline was 9.5 seizures per week. Both groups had a significant reduction in seizure frequency. Response scores and response ratios did not differ between the intellectually disabled and normal groups (1.67+/-0.67 and 1.25+/-0.69, P = 0.697, and -0.400+/-0.089 and -0.283+/-0.159, P = 0.961, respectively).

In the present patient population, patients younger than 10 years of age, all of whom had intellectual disability, were more likely to have side-effects than those older than 10 years of age. Observed adverse effects, which were generally mild, occurred in patients with baseline intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder and behavioural problems. Behavioural adverse effects warranted discontinuation of the medication in only three patients. The severity of intellectual disability (mild versus moderate or severe) did not affect the extent of the response or the occurrence of side-effects. It is concluded that gabapentin is equally effective as an add-on medication against partial seizures in patients with or without intellectual disability. However, children with intellectual disability who also are less than 10 years of age with baseline attention deficit appear to be at a higher risk of behavioural side-effects."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake. Additionally, the effects on glutathione content and extracellular S100B levels were assessed. Acute hippocampal slices were incubated with haloperidol (10\u03bcM), clozapine (10 and 100\u03bcM) or alstonine (1-100\u03bcM), alone or in combination with apomorphine (100\u03bcM), and 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists (0.01\u03bcM altanserin and 0.1\u03bcM SB 242084). A reduction in glutamate uptake was observed with alstonine and clozapine, but not haloperidol. Apomorphine abolished the effect of clozapine, whereas 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) antagonists abolished the effects of alstonine. Increased levels of glutathione were observed only with alstonine, also the only compound that failed to decrease the release of S100B. This study shows that alstonine decreases glutamate uptake, which may be beneficial to the glutamatergic deficit observed in schizophrenia. Noteworthily, the decrease in glutamate uptake is compatible with the reversal of MK-801-induced social interaction and working memory deficits. An additional potential benefit of alstonine as an antipsychotic is its ability to increase glutathione, a key cellular antioxidant reported to be decreased in the brain of patients with schizophrenia. Adding to the characterization of the novel mechanism of action of alstonine, the lack of effect of apomorphine in alstonine-induced changes in glutamate uptake reinforces that D(2) receptors are not primarily implicated. Though clearly mediated by 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptors, the precise mechanisms that result in the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake warrant elucidation."

An association has recently been reported between the PTPN22-620W functional allele and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF+) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among other autoimmune diseases. Expected linkage proof for consistency cannot be definitely produced by an affected sib-pair (ASP) analysis. Our aim was therefore to search for linkage evidence with the transmission disequilibrium test. DNA from the French Caucasian population was available for two samples of 100 families with one RA patient and both parents, and for 88 RA index cases from RA ASP families. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The analysis was performed using the transmission disequilibrium test, genotype relative risk and ASP-based analysis. The transmission disequilibrium test of the PTPN22-620W allele revealed linkage and association for RF+ RA (61% of transmission, P = 0.037). The genotype relative risk showed the risk allele in 34% of RF+ RA patients and in 24% of controls derived from nontransmitted parental chromosomes (P = 0.047, odds ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-2.78). The ASP investigation showed no enriched risk allele in RA multiplex families, resulting in a lack of power of ASP analysis, explaining the published negative results. This study is the first to show linkage of PTPN22 to RF+ RA, consistent with PTPN22 as a new RA gene."

Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate the learned relationships are general and independent of cell-type. We provided a powerful tool to identify active enhancers and reveal the relationship between chromatin modifications, eRNA production and enhancer activity. "

The clinical characteristics, results of laboratory examination, treatment reaction and outcome of disease were investigated. The results indicated that out of 45 children diagnosed as DBA, 14 cases (31.1%) had short stature and physical malformation. All patients had anemia with reticulocytopenia. Thirty-four patients (75.6%) had mean corpuscular volume. Eleven patients (24.4%) had macrocytic anemia. Bone marrow examination showed a marked erythroid hypoplasia in all patients. Out of 29 cases tested for fetal hemoglobin (HbF), 13 cases (44.8%) had high level of HbF. Erythroid colony-forming unit of bone marrow was tested in 25 patients, among them 12 patients (48%) showed normal plasia, 13 (52%) showed hypoplasia. The erythropoietin (EPO) levels of 17 patients were elevated. Karyotypes were examined in 28 patients, and showed all normal. The treatment was based on corticosteroids and Cyclosporine A. Thirty patients had good response to corticosteroid therapy, and 10 of them obtained a sustained corticosteroid-induced remission. Twenty cases discontinued corticosteroid therapy after remission, as a result, 15 cases (75%) relapsed, moreover all the relapsed cases still had good response to corticosteroid. Two relapsed patients suffered from aplastic anemia, one of them died of therapy failure. Six patients were unresponsive to corticosteroid, 1 of which achieved remission with cyclosporine A and the others continued to receive regular transfusions. 3 patients received iron chelation therapy. It is concluded that the clinical characteristics, complete blood count, bone marrow smear, HbF level and EPO level are useful to make a diagnosis of DBA. Most patients have a good response to corticosteroid therapy, but relapse rate is high when drug was discontinued. Patients unresponsive to corticosteroid should receive regular transfusions and chelation therapy."

However, the mechanism of P-TEFb recruitment and regulation of NELF/DSIF during transcription is not fully understood. We investigated this question in interferon (IFN)-stimulated transcription, focusing on BRD4, a BET family protein that interacts with P-TEFb. Besides P-TEFb, BRD4 binds to acetylated histones through the bromodomain. We found that BRD4 and P-TEFb, although not present prior to IFN treatment, were robustly recruited to IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) after stimulation. Likewise, NELF and DSIF prior to stimulation were hardly detectable on ISGs, which were strongly recruited after IFN treatment. A shRNA-based knockdown assay of NELF revealed that it negatively regulates the passage of Pol II and DSIF across the ISGs during elongation, reducing total ISG transcript output. Analyses with a BRD4 small-molecule inhibitor showed that IFN-induced recruitment of P-TEFb and NELF/DSIF was under the control of BRD4. We suggest a model where BRD4 coordinates both positive and negative regulation of ISG elongation."

Consideration of receptor flexibility using an ensemble of precompiled receptor conformations or by employing an effectively enlarged binding pocket has been reported to be useful. However, direct consideration of receptor flexibility during energy optimization of the docked conformation has been less popular because of the large increase in computational complexity. In this paper, we present a new docking program called GalaxyDock that accounts for the flexibility of preselected receptor side-chains by global optimization of an AutoDock-based energy function trained for flexible side-chain docking. This method was tested on 3 sets of protein-ligand complexes (HIV-PR, LXR\u03b2, cAPK) and a diverse set of 16 proteins that involve side-chain conformational changes upon ligand binding. The cross-docking tests show that the performance of GalaxyDock is higher or comparable to previous flexible docking methods tested on the same sets, increasing the binding conformation prediction accuracy by 10%-60% compared to rigid-receptor docking. This encouraging result suggests that this powerful global energy optimization method may be further extended to incorporate larger magnitudes of receptor flexibility in the future.

All of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the \u03b1-granule content by immunofluorescence analysis for \u03b1-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9 novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, as well as nucleotide substitutions that altered the splicing mechanisms as determined at the RNA level. All the individuals with NBEAL2 biallelic mutations showed almost complete absence of platelet \u03b1-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and significant reduction of the \u03b1-granule content. However, they were not thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2 alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower severity of the \u03b1-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with \u03b1-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe reduction of the \u03b1-granules.

The expression of miR- 181, 1, 133, 23, and 107, all of which have been predicted to regulate transcription factors and co-activators involved in the adaptive response to exercise, was measured in quadriceps femoris muscle. Endurance exercise significantly increased the expression of miR-181, miR-1, and miR-107 by 37%, 40%, and 56%, respectively, and reduced miR-23 expression by 84% (P<or=0.05 for all), with no change in miR-133. Importantly, decreased expression of miRNA-23, a putative negative regulator of PGC-1alpha was consistent with increased expression of PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein along with several downstream targets of PGC-1alpha including ALAS, CS, and cytochrome c mRNA. PDK4 protein content remains unaltered despite an increase in its putative negative regulator, miR-107, and PDK4 mRNA expression. mRNA expression of miRNA processing machinery (Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8) remained unchanged. We conclude that miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation is potentially involved in the complex regulatory networks that govern skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance exercise in C57Bl/6J male mice."

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of cell death during the secondary damage caused by TBI in vivo and in vitro, as well as the protective effect of resveratrol (RV). Here we report that glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) activation and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 processing were induced in rat brains exposed to TBI. In the in vitro TBI model, apoptotic and autophagic cell death were induced through glutamate-mediated GSK-3\u03b2 activation in normal CTX TNA2 astrocytes. The GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 or transfection of GSK-3\u03b2 small-interfering RNA increases cell survival. By contrast, overexpression of GSK-3\u03b2 enhanced glutamate excitotoxicity. Administration of RV reduced cell death in CTX TNA2 astrocytes by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated GSK-3\u03b2 activation, the mechanism by which RV also exerted protective effects in vivo. Mitochondrial damages, including the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and mitochondrial depolarization, were induced by glutamate through the ROS/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway. Moreover, cyclosporine A, an MPTP inhibitor, suppressed mitochondrial damage and the percentages of cells undergoing autophagy and apoptosis and thereby increased cell survival. Taken together, our results demonstrated that cell death occurring after TBI is induced through the ROS/GSK-3\u03b2/mitochondria signaling pathway and that administration of RV can increase cell survival by suppressing GSK-3\u03b2-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Therefore, the results indicated that resveratrol may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of TBI. "

The investigation was made more complex by the fact that the surface of the mummy had been swabbed with phenol soon after the discovery (September 19, 1991). Our results show that no trace of microbial DNA is left on the actual surface of the body, while the untreated skin still bears the remains of large numbers of bacteria belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Afipia, Curtobacterium, Microbacterium, Agromyces, and others. Compared to the untreated skin, the iceman's muscle is also very rich in bacterial DNA. However, this DNA comes, with few exceptions, from the species Clostridium algidicarnis. The sharp difference in the bacterial DNA composition of skin and muscle suggests that the remains of the original cadaveric microflora of the latter have not disappeared during the iceman's taphonomic history. On the other hand, the massive presence of C. algidicarnis, a cold-adapted sporigenous, the DNA of which was previously (Ubaldi et al. [1998] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 107:285-295) found in the soft tissue of a naturally desiccated Andean mummy, indicates that the hypothesis that the iceman's corpse underwent rapid dehydration by the effect of a warm wind (f\u00f6hn) is no longer plausible. The results best fit with the hypothesis (Bereuter et al. [1997] Chem. Eur. J. 7:1032-1038) that the body was first covered by snow and ice, and then underwent thawing and, finally, desiccation."

These drugs restored cognitive impairments in several animal models for AD, mimicking different aspects of AD, with a high safety margin (e.g. AF150[S] >1500 and AF267B >4500). Notably, these compounds show a high bioavailability and a remarkable preference for the brain vs. plasma following p.o. administration. In mice with small hippocampi, unlike rivastigmine and nicotine, AF150(S) and AF267B restored cognitive impairments also on escape latency in a Morris water maze paradigm in reversal learning. Furthermore, in aged and cognitively impaired microcebes (a natural animal model that mimics AD pathology and cognitive impairments), prolonged treatment with AF150(S) restored cognitive and behavioral impairments and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation, PHF and astrogliosis.

Active and repressive C/EBPbeta interacts with multisubunit Mediator complexes through the CRSP130/Sur2 subunit. The CRSP130/Sur2 subunit is common to two distinct types of Mediator complexes, characterized by CRSP70 and CDK8 proteins as transcriptionally active and inactive Mediator, respectively. Knockdown of CRSP130/Sur2 prevents Mediator binding and transactivation through C/EBPbeta. Oncogenic Ras signaling or activating mutations in C/EBPbeta selects the transcriptionally active Mediator complex that also associates with RNA polymerase II.

We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment. However, significant increases in the levels of all nuclear transcripts were observed in the liver 24 h after T3 treatment, but were delayed or remained unaltered (VIc) in muscle. In contrast, levels of mitochondrial transcripts were elevated early in muscle and late in liver. The abundance of the corresponding polypeptides, which were analyzed by immunoblotting, changed in direction and magnitude according to the changes in their mRNAs, indicating pretranslational control. We conclude that the two genomes are regulated by T3 not through a common coordinating mechanism, but via two separate pathways, which respond to T3 with tissue-specific kinetics. S1-nuclease protection analysis showed that probably only one transcript for subunit VIc is present in both tissues, thus excluding the possibility that the tissue-specific response is due to the expression of two isogenes. The abundance of mitochondrial DNA was unaltered despite the observed changes in mitochondrial transcripts, indicating that mitochondrial gene expression is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms and not by gene dosage as has been postulated by others."

A number of new treatments have been described with variable success in different parts of the world. In this article, the fundamentals of treatment for H. pylori treatment are reviewed and new treatment algorithms are proposed for regions of the world where triple therapy is failing. Sequential therapy and quadruple therapy (either bismuth-based or non-bismuth-based) are the best current options to replace initial treatment with triple therapy. When initial treatment fails, salvage treatments using rifabutin and levofloxacin are the best options. With knowledge of local resistance patterns and with meticulous confirmation of eradication with retreatment, most H. pylori infections can be successfully eradicated."

However, rare codons persist, presumably due to neutral drift. Here, we determine whether other, unknown factors, beyond neutral drift, affect the selection and/or distribution of rare codons. We have developed a novel algorithm that evaluates the relative rareness of a nucleotide sequence used to produce a given protein sequence. We show that rare codons, rather than being randomly scattered across genes, often occur in large clusters. These clusters occur in numerous eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and are not confined to unusual or rarely expressed genes: many highly expressed genes, including genes for ribosomal proteins, contain rare codon clusters. A rare codon cluster can impede ribosome translation of the rare codon sequence. These results indicate additional selective pressures govern the use of synonymous codons, and specifically that local pauses in translation can be beneficial for protein biogenesis."

This process is predominantly controlled by Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor. This very large protein (MW 560 kDa) exists as a homotetramer (~2.2 MDa) and is expressed in three isoforms: RyR1, expressed in skeletal muscle; RyR2, expressed in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, expressed in various cells at lower levels than the other isoforms. Release of Ca(2+) via RyR2 is induced by Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels and is modulated by multiple factors, including phosphorylation of RyR2 protein by protein kinase A, calmodulin kinase II and FKBP12.6, and stimulation via the beta-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway. Hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 induces Ca(2+) leak during diastole, which can cause fatal arrhythmias and lead to heart failure. This makes RyR2 an important therapeutic target. Although there are few commercially available drugs that inhibit Ca(2+) leak from RyR2, K201 (JTV-519), a benzothiazepine derivative, has emerged as a new ryanodine receptor-selective agent that prevents atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the basic structure and function of ryanodine receptors, their involvement in heart disease, and the development of drugs to prevent ryanodine receptor malfunction and recent patents."

Unexpectedly, inhibitor 2 was also found to markedly decrease protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban as well these other microsomal substrates. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Protein phosphatase 2B is also capable of dephosphorylating these three substrates."

Next, the best linear combination of three-, four-, and five-feature pharmacophores in terms of selected performance parameter (i.e., recall, F-score, and MCC) is constructed. The resultant queries showed significantly better VS performance and new scaffold recognition when compared with the known ligand- and receptor-based pharmacophore models.

However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying such a toxicity have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we performed short-term and long-term in vitro treatments on primary human and rat hepatocyte cultures as well as on nonparenchymal rat liver epithelial cells (RLEC), known as CYP1A-deficient cells. Cell ultrastructure was analyzed under different conditions and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. The effects of THA on protein synthesis, intermediary metabolism and reduced glutathione (GSH) level were also determined in rat hepatocytes. THA induced dose-dependent toxic effects in liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells, with human hepatocytes being less sensitive. This toxicity appeared to be unrelated to metabolism of THA since similar effects were observed in rat hepatocytes and RLEC, in which THA metabolism was found negligible. Ribosome aggregation appeared only at high concentrations (> 1 mmol/L) and was not specific to hepatocytes. Therefore, the THA-induced decrease in protein synthesis observed at lower concentrations was likely not related to this alteration. ATP and glycogen levels as well as GSH content were reduced upon THA. However, while glycogen level decreased at THA doses similar to those inducing an increase in LDH release, the fall in ATP and GSH contents occurred at higher doses. Thus, glycogen level in hepatocytes appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of THA toxicity than were ATP and GSH levels. We also found that protein synthesis started to decrease at THA doses that were still ineffective on LDH release. This might suggest that the decrease in synthesis of one or several proteins upon THA treatment represents the early signal leading cells to death."

Good and consistent recoveries were obtained, with average extraction recoveries of 91.61 and 88.93% for sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, respectively. The chromatographic separation of the three analytes was achieved within only 2.8 min by an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate, which was then adjusted to pH 4.0 by acetic acid-acetonitrile-0.1% methanolic formic acid (12 + 25 + 63, v/v/v) flowing through a C18 Zorbax eclipse plus column (5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm; Agilent).

New electrode configurations as well as new implantable pulse generators are now available. Application of closed-loop or adaptive stimulation in clinical practice will allow DBS to deliver stimulation in a truly physiological way to restore aberrant neurological circuits on demand, thus avoiding side effects, tolerance and also saving the battery life. Besides DBS and standard thalamotomy, novel surgical approaches for ET are on the horizon. The development of MRI-guided focused ultrasound technique has been the new frontier of deep brain lesional therapies. Although the benefit of motor cortex stimulation is yet to be defined, this minimally invasive approach remains intriguing. Although the advances of surgical treatments along the clinical and technological directions described in this review will certainly contribute to a successful management of ET patients, future studies need to consider critical issues such as the heterogeneity of ET and the development of tolerance.

Not surprisingly, therefore, there has been considerable interest in developing Selective ER Degraders (SERDs), compounds that target the receptor for degradation. Currently, ICI 182,780 (ICI, fulvestrant) is the only SERD approved for the treatment of breast cancer. However, the poor pharmaceutical properties of this injectable drug and its lack of superiority over second line aromatase inhibitors in late stage breast cancer have negatively impacted its clinical use. These findings have provided the impetus to develop second generation, orally bioavailable SERDs with which quantitative turnover of ER\u03b1 in tumors can be achieved. Interestingly however, the contribution of SERD activity to fulvestrant efficacy is unclear, making it difficult to define the characteristics desired of the next generation of ER antagonists. It is of significance therefore, that we have determined that the antagonist activity of ICI and its ability to induce ER\u03b1 degradation are not coupled processes. Specifically, our results indicate that it is the ability of ICI to interact with ER\u03b1 and to (a) competitively displace estradiol and (b) induce a conformational change in ER incompatible with transcriptional activation that are likely to be the most important pharmacological characteristics of this drug. Collectively, these data argue for a renewed emphasis on the development of high affinity, orally bioavailable pure antagonists and suggest that SERD activity though proven effective may not be required for ER\u03b1 antagonism in breast cancer."

The phosphorylation of Tau is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A, which in turn is regulated by inhibitor 2, I2(PP2A). In acidic conditions such as generated by brain ischemia and hypoxia, especially in association with hyperglycemia as in diabetes, I2(PP2A) is cleaved by asparaginyl endopeptidase at Asn-175 into the N-terminal fragment (I2NTF) and the C-terminal fragment (I2CTF). Both I2NTF and I2CTF are known to bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and inhibit its activity. Here we show that the level of activated asparaginyl endopeptidase is significantly increased, and this enzyme and I2(PP2A) translocate, respectively, from neuronal lysosomes and nucleus to the cytoplasm where they interact and are associated with hyperphosphorylated Tau in Alzheimer disease brain. Asparaginyl endopeptidase from Alzheimer disease brain could cleave GST-I2(PP2A), except when I2(PP2A) was mutated at the cleavage site Asn-175 to Gln. Finally, an induction of acidosis by treatment with kainic acid or pH 6.0 medium activated asparaginyl endopeptidase and consequently produced the cleavage of I2(PP2A), inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and the knockdown of asparaginyl endopeptidase with siRNA abolished this pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest the involvement of brain acidosis in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and asparaginyl endopeptidase-I2(PP2A)-protein phosphatase 2A-Tau hyperphosphorylation pathway as a therapeutic target."

Since clinical pattern, etiology, prognosis and treatment differ among these severe skin reactions, a clear diagnosis based on a comprehensive clinical examination, skin biopsy, and specific laboratory tests is necessary. Because most of these reactions are caused by drug intake, a thorough history of medication use has to be obtained. However, there are cases with an infectious or idiopathic cause. In any case it is crucial to identify the most likely cause and rapidly discontinue the inducing agent, if a drug cause is suspected. This is associated with the patient`s prognosis which is often poor for bullous reaction. In addition, patient's age, underlying conditions, and the extent of skin detachment play a major role in terms of prognosis. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions are T-cell-mediated reactions, and certain alleles of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are involved in the activation of T-cells with cytotoxic effect. The therapeutic options depend on the clinical diagnosis. For all reactions a symptomatic and adequate supportive therapy is necessary, in some cases a systemic immunomodulating therapy can be useful."

The use of thalidomide for toxic epidermal necrolysis can lead to an increase in mortality, and its use as a prophylactic agent for the prevention of chronic graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation has raised more speculations as to the safety of this notorious drug. A review of the therapeutic indications for thalidomide in dermatology as well as the mechanisms of action and side-effects of this drug are presented.

Del(12p) has been described in 0.6 to 5% of MDS patients at initial diagnosis and is associated with a good to intermediate prognosis as a sole anomaly according to current scoring systems. Here, we present the results of a systematic del(12p) testing in a German prospective diagnostic study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01355913) on 367 MDS patients in whom CD34+ peripheral blood cells were analysed for the presence of del(12p) by sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. A cohort of 2,902 previously published MDS patients diagnosed by CBA served as control. We demonstrate that, using a sensitive FISH technique, 12p deletion occurs significantly more frequently in MDS than previously described (7.6% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 1.6% by CBA, P < 0.001) and is often associated with other aberrations (93% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 60% by CBA). Additionally, the detection rate can be increased by repeated analyses in a patient over time which is important for the patient\u00b4s prognosis to distinguish a sole anomaly from double or complex aberrations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to screen for 12p deletions with a suitable probe for ETV6/TEL in 12p13. Our data suggest that the supplement of a probe for the detection of a 12p deletion to common FISH probe panels helps to avoid missing a del(12p), especially as part of more complex aberrations."

BACKGROUND ON FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by several mutations in the LDL-receptor gene. The reduced number or absence of functional LDL receptors results in impaired hepatic clearance of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles, which results in extremely high levels of LDL-C in the bloodstream. Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by excess LDL-C deposits in tendons and arterial walls, early onset of atherosclerotic disease, and premature cardiac death. Familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in both HTZ and HMZ forms. Heterozygous FH is one of the most common monogenic metabolic disorders in the general population, occurring in approximately 1 in 500 individuals. Nevertheless, HTZ FH is largely undiagnosed and an accurate diagnosis occurs in only about 15% of affected patients in Canada. Thus, it is estimated that there are approximately 3,800 diagnosed and 21,680 undiagnosed cases of HTZ FH in Ontario. In HTZ FH patients, half of the LDL receptors do not work properly or are absent, resulting in plasma LDL-C levels 2- to 3-fold higher than normal (range 7-15mmol/L or 300-500mg/dL). Most HTZ FH patients are not diagnosed until middle age when either they or one of their siblings present with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Without lipid-lowering treatment, 50% of males die before the age of 50 and 25% of females die before the age of 60, from myocardial infarction or sudden death. In contrast to the HTZ form, HMZ FH is rare (occurring in 1 case per million persons) and more severe, with a 6- to 8-fold elevation in plasma LDL-C levels (range 15-25mmol/L or 500-1000mg/dL). Homozygous FH patients are typically diagnosed in infancy, usually due to the presence of cholesterol deposits in the skin and tendons. The main complication of HMZ FH is supravalvular aortic stenosis, which is caused by cholesterol deposits on the aortic valve and in the ascending aorta. The average life expectancy of affected individuals is 23 to 25 years. In Ontario, it is estimated that there are 13 to 15 cases of HMZ FH. An Ontario clinical expert confirmed that 9 HMZ FH patients have been identified to date."

Animal models used in the discovery of novel treatments for obesity range from straightforward measures of food intake in lean rodents to long-term studies in animals exhibiting obesity due to the continuous access to diets high in fat. The utility of these animal models can be extended to determine, for example, that weight loss is due to fat loss and/or assess whether beneficial changes in key plasma parameters (e.g. insulin) are evident. In addition, behavioural models such as the behavioural satiety sequence can be used to confirm that a drug treatment has a selective effect on food intake. Typically, animal models have excellent predictive validity whereby drug-induced weight loss in rodents subsequently translates to weight loss in man. However, despite this, at the time of writing orlistat (Europe; USA) remains the only drug currently marketed for the treatment of obesity, with sibutramine having recently been withdrawn from sale globally due to the increased incidence of serious, non-fatal cardiovascular events. While the utility of rodent models in predicting clinical weight loss is detailed, the review also discusses whether animals can be used to predict adverse events such as those seen with recent anti-obesity drugs in the clinic."

In our study, SPAG5 expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays. SPAG5 was upregulated in tumor tissue compared with paired adjacent noncancerous tissues; SPAG5 upregulation in tumor tissues indicated poor disease-free survival, which was also an independent prognostic indicator for cervical cancer patients. In vitro study demonstrated that SPAG5 downregulation inhibited cell proliferation and growth significantly by G2/M arrest and induction of apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion. Under SPAG5 downregulation, the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells differed according to taxol dose, which correlated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway activity. In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in cervical cancer. "

Plk1 activation is promoted by the conserved protein Bora (SPAT-1 in C. elegans), which stimulates the phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the activation loop by the Aurora A kinase. In a recent article published in Cell Reports, we show that the master mitotic kinase Cdk1 contributes to Plk1 activation through SPAT-1/Bora phosphorylation. We identified 3 conserved Sp/Tp residues that are located in the N-terminal, most conserved part, of SPAT-1/Bora. Phosphorylation of these sites by Cdk1 is essential for Plk1 function in mitotic entry in C. elegans embryos and during DNA damage checkpoint recovery in mammalian cells. Here, using an untargeted F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor to monitor Plk1 activation, we provide additional experimental evidence supporting the importance of these phosphorylation sites for Plk1 activation and subsequent mitotic entry after DNA damage. We also briefly discuss the mechanism of Plk1 activation and the potential role of Bora phosphorylation by Cdk1 in this process. As Plk1 is overexpressed in cancer cells and this correlates with poor prognosis, understanding how Bora contributes to Plk1 activation is paramount for the development of innovative therapeutical approaches."

However, Hsp104 has no metazoan homologue. Metazoa possess protein disaggregase systems distinct from Hsp104, including Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40, as well as HtrA1, which might be harnessed to reverse deleterious protein misfolding. Nevertheless, vicissitudes of aging, environment, or genetics conspire to negate these disaggregase systems in neurodegenerative disease.

Faecal samples were obtained and microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis by Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology. Intermittent hypoxia exposures translated into hypoxia/re-oxygenation patterns in the faeces proximal to the bowel epithelium (<200\u2005\u03bcm). A significant effect of intermittent hypoxia on global microbial community structure was found. Intermittent hypoxia increased the \u03b1-diversity (Shannon index, p<0.05) and induced a change in the gut microbiota (ANOSIM analysis of \u03b2-diversity, p<0.05). Specifically, intermittent hypoxia-exposed mice showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a smaller abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla than controls. Faecal microbiota composition and diversity are altered as a result of intermittent hypoxia realistically mimicking OSA, suggesting the possibility that physiological interplays between host and gut microbiota could be deregulated in OSA."

The presence of two or one of the manifestations mentioned above, with granulomatous cheilitis in the biopsy, is sufficient to make the diagnosis of monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic form of MRS. This syndrome is very rare in childhood, instead, it is more frequent in young adults between the second and third decades of life. We present the case of an 8 years old boy who was brought to us because of a non painful swelling of the upper lip, associated with gingival hypertrophy, that had persisted for more than two months. Given the negative results of the hemato-chemical and instrumental assessments, we performed an upper lip biopsy whose histological study showed granulomatous cheilitis.

For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated. Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions."

However, most patients who experience adverse symptoms during statin use are able to tolerate at least some degree of statin therapy. Given the profound cardiovascular benefits derived from statins, an adequate practical approach to statin intolerance is, therefore, of great clinical importance. Statin intolerance can be defined as the occurrence of myalgia or other adverse symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy and that lead to its discontinuation. In reality, these symptoms are actually unrelated to statin use in many patients, especially in those with atypical presentations following long periods of treatment. Thus, the first step in approaching patients with adverse symptoms during the course of statin therapy is identification of those patients for whom true statin intolerance is unlikely, since most of these patients would probably be capable of tolerating adequate statin therapy. In patients with statin intolerance, an altered dosing regimen of very low doses of statins should be attempted and, if tolerated, should gradually be increased to achieve the highest tolerable doses. In addition, other lipid-lowering drugs may be needed, either in combination with statins, or alone, if statins are not tolerated at all. Stringent control of other risk factors can aid in reducing cardiovascular risk if attaining lipid treatment goals proves difficult. "

Recent reports have revealed that CIDE family proteins play important roles in lipid metabolism. Several studies involving knockdown mice revealed that FSP27 is a lipid droplet-targeting protein that can promote the formation of lipid droplets. However, the detailed roles of human CIDEC in the differentiation of human adipocytes remain unknown. In the present study, we found that the expression of CIDEC increased during the differentiation of fetal adipose tissues, but decreased during the de-differentiation of adipocytic tumors, suggesting that the expression of CIDEC should be positively correlated with the differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, we verified that human CIDEC was localized on the surface of lipid droplets. Using human primary pre-adipocytes, we confirmed that the expression of CIDEC was elevated during the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, and knockdown of CIDEC in human primary pre-adipocytes resulted in differentiation defects. These data demonstrate that CIDEC is essential for the differentiation of adipose tissue. Together with regulating adipocyte lipid metabolism, CIDEC should be a potential target for regulating adipocyte differentiation and reducing fat cell mass."

Kinetochores assemble at the centromeric DNA organized by specialized centromeric nucleosomes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, which typically have large repetitive centromeric regions, budding yeast CEN DNA is defined by a 125 bp sequence and assembles a single centromeric nucleosome. In budding yeast, as well as in other eukaryotes, the Cse4 histone variant (known in vertebrates as CENP-A) is believed to substitute for histone H3 at the centromeric nucleosome. However, the exact composition of the CEN nucleosome remains a subject of debate. We report the use of a novel ChIP approach to reveal the composition of the centromeric nucleosome and its localization on CEN DNA in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed a strong interaction of H3, as well as Cse4, H4, H2A, and H2B, but not histone chaperone Scm3 (HJURP in human) with the centromeric DNA. H3 localizes to centromeric DNA at all stages of the cell cycle. Using a sequential ChIP approach, we could demonstrate the co-occupancy of H3 and Cse4 at the CEN DNA. Our results favor a H3-Cse4 heterotypic octamer at the budding yeast centromere. Whether or not our model is correct, any future model will have to account for the stable association of histone H3 with the centromeric DNA."

The repeating unit of eukaryotic chromosomes is the nucleosome core, consisting of DNA wound about a defined octamer of histone proteins. Two enzymatic processes that regulate transcription by targeting elements of the nucleosome include ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling and reversible histone acetylation. The histone deacetylases, however, are unable to deacetylate oligonucleosomal histones in vitro. The protein complexes that mediate ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling and histone acetylation/deacetylation in the regulation of transcription were considered to be different, although it has recently been suggested that these activities might be coupled. We report here the identification and functional characterization of a novel ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling activity that is part of an endogenous human histone deacetylase complex. This activity is derived from the CHD3 and CHD4 proteins which contain helicase/ATPase domains found in SWI2-related chromatin remodelling factors, and facilitates the deacetylation of oligonucleosomal histones in vitro. We refer to this complex as the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylating (NRD) complex.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis helps to ensure that CENP-A does not mislocalize to euchromatin, which can lead to genomic instability. Consistent with this, overexpression of the budding yeast CENP-A(Cse4) is lethal in cells lacking Psh1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets CENP-A(Cse4) for degradation. To identify additional mechanisms that prevent CENP-A(Cse4) misincorporation and lethality, we analyzed the genome-wide mislocalization pattern of overexpressed CENP-A(Cse4) in the presence and absence of Psh1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing. We found that ectopic CENP-A(Cse4) is enriched at promoters that contain histone H2A.Z(Htz1) nucleosomes, but that H2A.Z(Htz1) is not required for CENP-A(Cse4) mislocalization. Instead, the INO80 complex, which removes H2A.Z(Htz1) from nucleosomes, promotes the ectopic deposition of CENP-A(Cse4). Transcriptional profiling revealed gene expression changes in the psh1\u0394 cells overexpressing CENP-A(Cse4). The down-regulated genes are enriched for CENP-A(Cse4) mislocalization to promoters, while the up-regulated genes correlate with those that are also transcriptionally up-regulated in an htz1\u0394 strain. Together, these data show that regulating centromeric nucleosome localization is not only critical for maintaining centromere function, but also for ensuring accurate promoter function and transcriptional regulation."

Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1 are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1 and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, which are known regulators of ependymal cell generation, and that Notch signaling inhibits GemC1 and Mcidas function. Our results suggest that Mcidas and GemC1 are key players in the generation of multiciliated ependymal cells of the adult neurogenic niche. "

Twelve sets of primers were constructed (eight for tox and four for dtxR), and three regions within tox and all four regions of dtxR showed significant variations in the number and/or sizes of the amplicons. Two to four different SSCP patterns were identified in each of the variable regions; subsequently, tox and dtxR could be classified into 6 and 12 different types, respectively. The great majority of epidemic strains from both Russia and Ukraine had tox types 3 and 4, and only in a single preepidemic strain isolated in Russia were all eight tox regions identical to those of C. diphtheriae Park-Williams No. 8 (tox type 1). Epidemic strains from Ukraine can easily be identified by dtxR type 5, while the majority of the Russian epidemic strains have dtxR of types 2 and 8. No differences in the tox regions between mitis and gravis biotype strains were observed. However, dtxR types 2, 5, and 8 were identified only in the gravis biotype, and dtxR type 1 was characteristic for the mitis biotype strains. PCR-SSCP is a simple and rapid method for the identification of variable tox and dtxR regions that allows for the clear association of tox and dtxR types with strains of distinct temporal and/or geographic origins."

In animal models used commonly to screen for antidepressant activity, bupropion shows a positive response. Also using animal models, bupropion has been shown to attenuate nicotine-induced unconditioned behaviors, to share or enhance discriminative stimulus properties of nicotine and to have a complex effect on nicotine self-administration, i.e., low doses augmenting nicotine self-administration and high doses attenuating self-administration. Current studies show that bupropion facilitates the acquisition of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats, further suggesting that bupropion enhances the rewarding properties of nicotine. Bupropion has been shown to attenuate the expression of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in both animal models and human subjects. With respect to relapse, current studies show that bupropion attenuates nicotine-induced reinstatement in rats, but large individual differences are apparent. Clinically, bupropion is used as a treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent. In clinical trials, bupropion is being tested as a candidate treatment for psychostimulant drug abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity. Bupropion is available in three bioequivalent oral formulations, immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (XL). Extensive hepatic metabolism of bupropion produces three pharmacologically active metabolites, which may contribute to its clinical profile."

Fibrillar polymers-actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments-are major constituents of the cytoskeleton, which constantly change their organization during cellular activities. The actin cytoskeleton is especially polymorphic, as actin filaments can form multiple higher order assemblies performing different functions. Structural information about cytoskeleton organization is critical for understanding its functions and mechanisms underlying various forms of cellular activity. Because of the nanometer-scale thickness of cytoskeletal fibers, electron microscopy (EM) is a key tool to determine the structure of the cytoskeleton. This article describes application of rotary shadowing (or metal replica) EM for visualization of the cytoskeleton. The procedure is applicable to thin cultured cells growing on glass coverslips and consists of detergent extraction of cells to expose their cytoskeleton, chemical fixation to provide stability, ethanol dehydration and critical point drying to preserve three-dimensionality, rotary shadowing with platinum to create contrast, and carbon coating to stabilize replicas. This technique provides easily interpretable three-dimensional images, in which individual cytoskeletal fibers are clearly resolved, and individual proteins can be identified by immunogold labeling. More importantly, replica EM is easily compatible with live cell imaging, so that one can correlate the dynamics of a cell or its components, e.g., expressed fluorescent proteins, with high resolution structural organization of the cytoskeleton in the same cell."

Small RNAs are also subject to 3' end cleavage but are not polyadenylated. Here we show that two newly identified proteins, Pti1p and Ref2p, although they were found associated with the pre-mRNA 3' end processing complex, are essential for yeast snoRNA 3' end maturation. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts."

Although existing methodologies increased the number of computationally predicted enhancers, performance inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines, class imbalance within the learning sets and ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning, are some key questions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2% accuracy and 90% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1% and accuracy of 89.64%.

Ipi3p interacts with pre-RC proteins, binds chromatin predominantly at ARS sequences in a cell cycle-regulated and ORC- and Noc3p-dependent manner and is required for loading Cdc6p, Cdt1p and MCM onto chromatin to form pre-RC during the M-to-G\u2081 transition and for pre-RC maintenance in G\u2081 phase-independent of its role in ribosome biogenesis.

The vaccine has been shown to be highly immunogenic, with seroconversion rates of 95 to 100% being achieved for each of the 3 component vaccines. This immunity appears to be long-lasting and may even be lifelong. Minor adverse effects may occur approximately 1 week after immunisation. Rarely, mumps vaccine-induced meningitis (milder than that associated with wild mumps virus) may occur, its frequency varying with the strain of attenuated mumps virus contained in any particular vaccine. Clinically, the vaccine is indicated for infants aged between 12 and 15 months, and should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. A few specific contraindications exist, including a genuine hypersensitivity to eggs, and to the aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin and neomycin. An increasing number of countries are now adopting a 2-stage MMR policy in an attempt to prevent epidemics among those who remain unprotected, and to move towards eventual disease eradication."

Several studies have demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inducing the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). However, experimental, epidemiologic, and pharmacologic data provide important evidence on the role of PCSK9 also on high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). In mice, PCSK9 regulates the HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by the degradation of hepatic LDLR, thus inhibiting the uptake of apolipoprotein (Apo)E-containing HDLs. Several epidemiologic and genetic studies reported positive relationship between PCSK9 and HDL-C levels, likely by reducing the uptake of the ApoE-containing HDL particles. PCSK9 enhances also the degradation of LDLR's closest family members, ApoE receptor 2, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and LDLR-related protein 1. This feature provides a molecular mechanism by which PCSK9 may affect HDL metabolism. Experimental studies demonstrated that PCSK9 directly interacts with HDL by modulating PCSK9 self-assembly and its binding to the LDLR. Finally, the inhibition of PCSK9 by means of monoclonal antibodies directed to PCSK9 (ie, evolocumab and alirocumab) determines an increase of HDL-C fraction by 7% and 4.2%, respectively. Thus, the understanding of the role of PCSK9 on HDL metabolism needs to be elucidated with a particular focus on the effect of PCSK9 on HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport."

Both syndromes feature sparse hair heralding progressive macular dystrophy. EEM syndrome is characterized in addition by ectodermal and limb defects.

Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions."

The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has only a minor role in this process. The MTREC complex physically interacts with the nuclear exosome and with various RNA-binding and RNA-processing complexes, coupling RNA processing to the RNA degradation machinery.

Despite longer subsequences unlocking longer genomic features for assembly, associated increase in compute resources limits the practicability of DBG over other assembly archetypes already designed for longer reads. Here, we revisit the DBG paradigm to adapt it to the changing sequencing technology landscape and introduce three data structure designs for spaced seeds in the form of paired subsequences. These data structures address memory and run time constraints imposed by longer reads. We observe that when a fixed distance separates seed pairs, it provides increased sequence specificity with increased gap length. Further, we note that Bloom filters would be suitable to implicitly store spaced seeds and be tolerant to sequencing errors. Building on this concept, we describe a data structure for tracking the frequencies of observed spaced seeds. These data structure designs will have applications in genome, transcriptome and metagenome assemblies, and read error correction. "

Recent evidence shows that these SGLT2 inhibitors with low SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity elevate the level of circulating glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. This effect probably occurs partly via inhibition of intestinal SGLT1, and the elevation of active GLP-1 levels is especially apparent when these drugs are co-administered with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. These findings suggest that a combination of canagliflozin or sotagliflozin and a DPP4 inhibitor can provide a beneficial effect associated with elevation of circulating active GLP-1 and may serve as a treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes."

The genetic-epidemiologic and biochemical evidence in ALDH2-deficient humans provides strong evidence for the causal relationship between acetaldehyde-exposure due to alcohol consumption and cancer of the upper digestive tract. The risk assessment has so far relied on thresholds based on animal toxicology with lower one-sided confidence limit of the benchmark dose values (BMDL) typically ranging between 11 and 63\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight (bw)/day dependent on species and endpoint. The animal data is problematic for regulatory toxicology for various reasons (lack in study quality, problems in animal models and appropriateness of endpoints - especially cancer - for transfer to humans). In this study, data from genetic epidemiologic and biochemical studies are reviewed. The increase in the daily exposure dose to acetaldehyde in alcohol-consuming ALDH2-deficients vs. ALDH2-actives was about twofold. The acetaldehyde increase due to ALDH2 inactivity was calculated to be 6.7\u00a0\u03bcg/kg\u00a0bw/day for heavy drinkers, which is associated with odds ratios of up to 7 for head and neck as well as oesophageal cancer. Previous animal toxicology based risk assessments may have underestimated the risk of acetaldehyde. Risk assessments of acetaldehyde need to be revised using this updated evidence."

In particular, replacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z has been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; however, the processes by which this occurs remain poorly understood. In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these variants with an extensive molecular dynamics study of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing structures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops. Simulation results show that variant L1 loops play a pivotal role in stabilizing DNA binding to the octamer through direct interactions, core structural rearrangements, and altered allosteric networks in the nucleosome. All variants influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the largest effect on energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of allosteric networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take advantage of stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics throughout the complex. Furthermore, we show that posttranslational modifications are enriched at key locations in these networks. Taken together, these results provide, to our knowledge, new insights into the relationship between the structure, dynamics, and function of the nucleosome core particle and chromatin fibers, and how they are influenced by chromatin remodeling factors.

Here, we employ a screen to identify partners of budding yeast Cdc48 that are important for disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG helicase at the end of chromosome replication. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding Ufd1-Npl4 complex recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG. Ubiquitylation of CMG in yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only detectable site of ubiquitylation both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (though in\u00a0vivo other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates in\u00a0vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction."

The plasma membrane and secretory vesicles, the fractions with the highest sterol contents, contain ergosterol as the major sterol. In other subcellular membranes, which exhibit lower sterol contents, intermediates of the sterol biosynthetic pathway were found at higher percentages. Lipid particles contain, in addition to ergosterol, large amounts of zymosterol, fecosterol, and episterol. These sterols are present esterified with long-chain fatty acids in this subcellular compartment, which also harbors practically all of the triacylglycerols present in the cell but very little phospholipids and proteins. Sterol delta 24-methyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes one of the late steps in sterol biosynthesis, was localized almost exclusively in lipid particles. Steryl ester formation is a microsomal process, whereas steryl ester hydrolysis occurs in the plasma membrane and in secretory vesicles. The fact that synthesis, storage, and hydrolysis of steryl esters occur in different subcellular compartments gives rise to the view that ergosteryl esters of lipid particles might serve as intermediates for the supply of ergosterol from internal membranes to the plasma membrane."

The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive. Recent bioinformatic analysis by Iyer et al.

Recently, dysregulation of hydroxylation of a single proline residue at position 986 of both the triple-helical domains of type I collagen alpha1(I) and type II collagen alpha1(II) chains has been implicated in the pathogenesis of recessive forms of OI. Two proteins, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene) form a complex that performs the hydroxylation and brings the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-B (CYPB) to the unfolded collagen. In our screen of 78 subjects diagnosed with OI type II or III, we identified three probands with mutations in CRTAP and 16 with mutations in LEPRE1. The latter group includes a mutation in patients from the Irish Traveller population, a genetically isolated community with increased incidence of OI. The clinical features resulting from CRTAP or LEPRE1 loss of function mutations were difficult to distinguish at birth. Infants in both groups had multiple fractures, decreased bone modeling (affecting especially the femurs), and extremely low bone mineral density. Interestingly, \"popcorn\" epiphyses may reflect underlying cartilaginous and bone dysplasia in this form of OI. These results expand the range of CRTAP/LEPRE1 mutations that result in recessive OI and emphasize the importance of distinguishing recurrence of severe OI of recessive inheritance from those that result from parental germline mosaicism for COL1A1 or COL1A2 mutations."

However, TAB2 alone is dispensable for NF-\u03baB activation in embryonic fibroblasts, and the functional roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in immune cells has yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that TAB2 and TAB3 are essential for B cell activation leading to Ag-specific Ab responses, as well as B-1 and marginal zone B cell development. TAB2 and TAB3 are critical for the activation of MAPKs, especially ERK, but not NF-\u03baB, in response to TLR and CD40 stimulation in B cells. Surprisingly, TAB2 and TAB3 are dispensable for TAK1 activation in B cells, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 activate MAPKs via a pathway independent of TAK1. In contrast to B cells, macrophages lacking TAB2 and TAB3 did not show any defects in the cytokine production and the signaling pathway in response to TLR stimulation. Furthermore, TAB2 and TAB3 were dispensable for TNF-induced cytokine production in embryonic fibroblasts. Thus, TAB2- and TAB3-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitin recognition controls B cell activation via MAPKs, but not the TAK1/NF-\u03baB axis."

Muscle function was evaluated by timed tests, and muscle strength with a hand-held myometer. After 55 months of treatment, the five patients (mean age 8.3 years) in the prednisone group were still able to get up from the floor, whereas two of the three in the control group had lost this ability. Side effects included a decline in growth rate in the prednisone-treated patients and excessive weight gain in one control and three treated patients. Because steroids are effective in prolonging function, but not in recovering lost function, we propose that treatment be started with low-dose prednisone in DMD patients as soon as the diagnosis is definite."

Here, we generated a zebrafish vegfd mutant by genome editing. vegfd mutants display significant defects in facial lymphangiogenesis independent of vegfc function. Strikingly, we find that vegfc and vegfd cooperatively control lymphangiogenesis throughout the embryo, including during the formation of the trunk lymphatic vasculature. Interestingly, we find that vegfd and vegfc also redundantly drive artery hyperbranching phenotypes observed upon depletion of Flt1 or Dll4. Epistasis and biochemical binding assays suggest that, during primary angiogenesis, Vegfd influences these phenotypes through Kdr (Vegfr2) rather than Flt4 (Vegfr3).

In the present study, we demonstrate that Id2 is involved in stabilization of the amplitudes of the circadian oscillations by suppressing transcriptional activation of clock genes Clock and Bmal1. Id2 shows dynamic oscillation in the SCN, with a peak in the late subjective night. Under constant dark conditions (DD), Id2(-/-) mice showed no apparent difference in locomotor activity, however, under constant light conditions (LL), Id2(-/-) mice exhibit aberrant locomotor activity, with lower circadian oscillation amplitudes, although the free running periods in Id2(-/-) mice show no differences from those in either wild type or heterozygous mice. Id2(-/-) animals also exhibit upregulation of Per1 in constant light, during both the subjective night and day. In wild type mice, Id2 is upregulated by constant light exposure during the subjective night. We propose that Id2 expression in the SCN contributes to maintenance of dynamic circadian oscillations. "

However, considering the costs of these drugs and the fact that only a subset of patients experience long-term disease control, the identification of predictive biomarkers for the selection of candidates suitable for treatment has become a priority. The research focused mainly on the expression of the PD-L1 receptor on both tumor cells and/or immune infiltrates determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, different checkpoint inhibitors were tested, different IHC assays were used, different targets were considered (tumor cells, immune infiltrates or both) and different expression thresholds were employed in clinical trials. In some trials the assay was used prospectively to select the patients, while in other trials it was evaluated retrospectively. Some confusion emerges, which makes it difficult to easily compare the literature data and to translate them in practice management.

We found that the gene family in Eucalyptus is slightly smaller than that in Populus and Arabidopsis, but all phylogenetic groups are represented. High-throughput expression profiling of different organs and tissues highlighted several Aux/IAA genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, some showing differential expression in response to developmental (juvenile vs. mature) and/or to environmental (tension stress) cues. Based on the expression profiles, we selected a promising candidate gene, EgrIAA4, for functional characterization. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Overexpressing a stabilized version of EgrIAA4 in Arabidopsis dramatically impeded plant growth and fertility and induced auxin-insensitive phenotypes such as inhibition of primary root elongation, lateral root emergence and agravitropism. Interestingly, the lignified secondary walls of the interfascicular fibers appeared very late, whereas those of the xylary fibers were virtually undetectable, suggesting that EgrIAA4 may play crucial roles in fiber development and secondary cell wall deposition.

Regarding the age old question of fusion or fission, it is concluded that there is no known embryologic process by which conjoined twins can be formed by fission but firm evidence to support fusion in all cases. Whether the fusion occurs between embryos on one embryonic disc or on two is of no consequence since they are all monovular. Intact ectoderm will not fuse to intact ectoderm, and all seven types of conjoined twins are explained by seven possible sites of union in the early embryo. One new term is proposed: parapagus, from the Greek para, meaning \"side,\" combined with pagus, meaning \"fixed\"; this is the group formerly called dicephalus or diprosopos. These anterolaterally united parapagus twins must result from two nearly parallel notochords in close proximity; craniopagi and pygopagi from fusion at the cranial and caudal neuropores, respectively; cephalopagi and ischiopagi from union at the pharyngeal and cloacal membranes, respectively; thoracopagi from merging of the cardiac anlage; and omphalopagi from fusion of the umbilicus or of the edges of two embryonic discs in any area not including the above sites. Parasitic twins result from embryonic death of one twin, leaving various portions of the body vascularized by the surviving autosite. The rarity of cases (2) not easily explained by the above theories, and the nearly 6% of twins with two umbilical cords arising from the placenta would seem to support these conclusions.

We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated \"bystander\" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment. These findings explain the absence of evolutionary breakpoints from large vertebrate chromosomal segments and will aid in the recognition of position effect mutations within human GRBs."

However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition."

MetS, estimated to affect 25% of adults in the United States, is associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of developing diabetes, a doubling of the risk of acquiring cardiovascular disease, and an increase in overall mortality. Defined as a syndrome, MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia. Urologic complications of MetS include a 30% higher risk of nephrolithiasis, with an increased percentage of uric acid nephrolithiasis in the setting of hyperuricemia, hyperuricosuria, low urine pH, and low urinary volume. Current American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines suggest investigating the etiology of nephrolithiasis in affected individuals; however, there is no specific goal of treating MetS as part of the medical management. Weight loss and exercise, the main lifestyle treatments of MetS, counter abdominal obesity and insulin resistance and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and the development of diabetes. These recommendations may offer a beneficial adjunctive treatment option for nephrolithiasis complicated by MetS. Although definitive therapeutic recommendations must await further studies, it seems both reasonable and justifiable for the urologist, as part of a multidisciplinary team, to recommend these important lifestyle changes to patients with both conditions. These recommendations should accompany the currently accepted management of nephrolithiasis. "

Here, we examined the effects of CARM1 inhibition on dendritic spine and synapse morphology in the rat hippocampus. CARM1 was localized in hippocampal post-synapses, with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealing co-localization of CARM1 with post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein, a post-synaptic marker. Specific siRNA-mediated suppression of CARM1 expression resulted in precocious dendritic maturation, with increased spine width and density at sites along dendrites and induction of mushroom-type spines.

Depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. To date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. Differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (Amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) pH greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells. The sensitivity and positive predictive value are both 90%. Vaginal Gram stain is also reliable and allows for permanent record. Cultures are nonspecific because G. vaginalis resides in normal vaginal flora as well. Papanicolaou smears are not particularly sensitive, but their positive predictive value is very high. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend three treatment regimens in nonpregnant patients: oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), intravaginal 2% clindamycin cream (one applicatorful at bedtime for 7 days), or intravaginal metronidazole gel (one to two applicatorfuls per day for 5 days). Alternative regimens include a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole or a 7-day course of oral clindamycin, 300 mg twice daily. The association between bacterial vaginosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes has satisfied many criteria for a causal inference. Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women with previous history of preterm labor results in fewer preterm deliveries than in untreated women from the same population."

It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine. "

Within this database, we collected all publicly available ChIP-Seq data on CRs in human and mouse and categorized the data into four cohorts: the reader, writer, eraser and remodeler cohorts, together with curated introductions and ChIP-Seq data analysis results. For the HM readers, writers and erasers, we provided further ChIP-Seq analysis data for the targeted HMs and schematized the relationships between them.

Here we report the identification of another N-terminal extended PTEN isoform, designated PTEN\u03b2. PTEN\u03b2 translation is initiated from an AUU codon upstream of and in-frame with the AUG initiation sequence for canonical PTEN. We show that the Kozak context and a downstream hairpin structure are critical for this alternative initiation. PTEN\u03b2 localizes predominantly in the nucleolus, and physically associates with and dephosphorylates nucleolin, which is a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein. Disruption of PTEN\u03b2 alters rDNA transcription and promotes ribosomal biogenesis, and this effect can be reversed by re-introduction of PTEN\u03b2. Our data show that PTEN\u03b2 regulates pre-rRNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate the complexity of the PTEN protein family and the diversity of its functions."

Mutation of Bdf1 bromodomains revealed defects on both the formation of spores and the meiotic progression, blocking cells at the exit from prophase, before the first meiotic division. This phenotype is associated with a massive deregulation of the transcription of meiotic genes and Bdf1 bromodomains are required for appropriate expression of the key meiotic transcription factor NDT80 and almost all the Ndt80-inducible genes, including APC complex components. Bdf1 notably accumulates on the promoter of Ndt80 and its recruitment is dependent on Bdf1 bromodomains. In addition, the ectopic expression of NDT80 during meiosis partially bypasses this dependency. Finally, purification of Bdf1 partners identified two independent complexes with Bdf2 or the SWR complex, neither of which was required to complete sporulation. Taken together, our results unveil a new role for Bdf1 -working independently from its predominant protein partners Bdf2 and the SWR1 complex-as a regulator of meiosis-specific genes."

Despite the economic importance of pentatomid pests worldwide, their feeding behavior is poorly understood. Electronically monitored insect feeding (EMIF) technology is a useful tool in studies of feeding behavior of Hemiptera. Here we examined H. halys feeding behavior using an EMIF system designed for high throughput studies in environmental chambers. Our objectives were to quantify feeding activity by monitoring proboscis contacts with green beans, including labial dabbing and stylet penetration of the beans, which we collectively define as 'probes'. We examined frequency and duration of 'probes' in field-collected H. halys over 48 hours and we determined how environmental conditions could affect diel and seasonal periodicity of 'probing' activity. We found differences in 'probing' activity between months when the assays were conducted. These differences in activity may have reflected different environmental conditions, and they also coincide with what is known about the phenology of H. halys. While a substantial number of 'probes' occurred during scotophase, including some of the longest mean 'probe' durations, activity was either lower or similar to 'probing' activity levels during photophase on average. We found that temperature had a significant impact on H. halys 'probing' behavior and may influence periodicity of activity. Our data suggest that the minimal temperature at which 'probing' of H. halys occurs is between 3.5 and 6.1 \u00b0C (95% CI), and that 'probing' does not occur at temperatures above 26.5 to 29.6 \u00b0C (95% CI). We estimated that the optimal temperature for 'probing' is between 16 and 17 \u00b0C."

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters of 2196 certainly diagnosed (1272 beta-thalassaemia minor and 924 iron deficiency) samples were used to evaluate the following indices and formulas: Bessman index (RDW), Mentzer formula (MCV/RBC), England and Fraser formula (MCV - RBC - 5 x Hb- 3.4), Shine and Lal formula (MCV2 x MCH/100), Ehsani formula (MCV-10 x RBC), Srivastava formula (MCH/RBC), Green and King formula (MCV2 x RDW/Hb x 100), red distribution width index RDWI (RDW x MCV/RBC), RDW/RBC, as well as our formula (MCV-RBC -3 x Hb). For each index and formula, the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), in addition, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated. No significant differences were reported between our formula, Green-King formula and the RDWI (P > 0.05) in discriminating beta-thalassaemia minor from iron deficiency (AUC = 0.914, 0.909 and 0.907 respectively). However, the three indices and formula showed the highest efficiencies and they were significantly (P < 0.05) better than the others in the discrimination efficiency . It was concluded that our formula, Green-King formula and the RDWI provided the highest reliabilities in differentiating beta-thalassaemia minor from iron deficiency in Palestinian population while Bessman index was poor and ineffective for that purpose."

Approval was based on an acceptable safety profile and high sustained virological response rates 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) in two phase 3 clinical trials in subjects previously treated with a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen. In POLARIS-1, 96% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. In POLARIS-4, 98% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. A key and challenging question in evaluating the data was determining the contribution of VOX to SOF/VEL and how this differed depending on the genotype and patient population. In this article, we provide our perspective on the issues considered in making these determinations, especially regarding the POLARIS-4 data in subjects who have previously been treated with a chronic HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor. Conclusion: We seek to provide context as to why a broad indication was given for NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients (HCV genotypes 1-6) while the indication for NS5A inhibitor- na\u00efve patients was limited to HCV genotypes 1a and 3 only.

In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve >99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations."

Each of these medications is approved for use in conjunction with psychosocial treatment; however, there is a dearth of empirical research on the optimal psychosocial interventions to use with these medications. In this systematic review, we outline and discuss the findings of 3 prominent prior reviews and 27 recent publications of empirical studies on this topic. The most widely studied psychosocial interventions examined in conjunction with medications for opioid addiction were contingency management and cognitive behavioral therapy, with the majority focusing on methadone treatment. The results generally support the efficacy of providing psychosocial interventions in combination with medications to treat opioid addictions, although the incremental utility varied across studies, outcomes, medications, and interventions. The review highlights significant gaps in the literature and provides areas for future research. Given the enormity of the current opioid problem in the United States, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the most effective ways to deliver psychosocial treatments in conjunction with these medications to improve the health and well-being of individuals suffering from opioid addiction.

On the other hand, CNS diseases like AD have been associated with gliosis and impaired neurogenesis. Further, renin angiotensin system (RAS) is intricately associated with hypertension; however, the accumulating evidences suggest that over-activity of RAS may perpetuate the brain inflammation related with AD. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of hypertension and RAS on glial (astrocytes and microglia) activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of chronic hypertension. We used Candesartan [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB)] both at a low dose (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) and anti-hypertensive dose (2\u00a0mg/kg) to explore whether their effect on astrocyte and microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis is blood pressure (BP) dependent or independent. Our data revealed that hypertension induces robust microglial and astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, and\u00a0cripples hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, AT1R blockade by Candesartan, even at low dose (0.1\u00a0mg/kg), prevented astrocyte and microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of hypertensive rats. Mechanistically, AT1R blockade prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of MAP kinase and NF\u043aB signaling. Importantly, we, for the first time to our knowledge, provided the evidence that AT1R blockade by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, promotes neurogenesis during hypertensive state. We conclude that AT1R blockade prevents astrocyte and microglial activation and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive state, independent of BP lowering action."

While sometimes mild in severity, it can be a distressing and painful chronic condition. Likewise, herpes labialis and herpes zoster can be both physically and psychologically painful. While there is no cure for these conditions, treatment to alleviate symptoms, suppress recurrences and reduce transmission has been drastically improved over the past 20 years with the use of guanine nucleoside antivirals, such as valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex), GlaxoSmithKline) the highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax((R)), GlaxoSmithKline), and famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir, Novartis). Clinical trials involving approximately 10,000 patients (including patients from nongenital herpes studies, such as herpes zoster) have assessed the safety and efficacy of valacyclovir in the treatment of initial genital herpes outbreaks, episodic treatment of recurrent episodes and daily suppressive therapy. It was shown that valacyclovir has similar efficacy to acyclovir in the episodic and suppressive treatment of genital herpes. Valacyclovir is the only antiviral drug approved for a once-daily dose of suppressive therapy for genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug US FDA approved for a 3-day regimen of episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes. In addition, valacyclovir is also indicated in the reduction of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus infection and for the treatment of herpes labialis. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir or placebo (and as equally effective as famciclovir) in shortening the length and severity of herpes zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia. Valacyclovir has an acceptable safety profile in patients with herpes simplex and herpes zoster. The less frequent dosing regimen makes it an attractive option in the treatment of genital herpes and other viral infections, and may contribute to increased patient adherence to therapy."

The topic of this review is how Tibetans have adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude. Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation that confers a higher affinity for oxygen, hence less sensitivity to hypoxia. Considering the demands imposed upon metabolism in meeting energy demands despite limitations on fuel oxidation, we hypothesized that other selected genes might alter metabolism to allow adaptation to altitude despite the desensitization of the upstream hypoxia sensing caused by the EGLN1 mutation that results in the failure to sense hypoxia. A shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would provide adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Measurements of serum metabolites from Tibetans living at high altitude are consistent with this hypothesis; the EPAS1 haplotype is significantly associated with increased lactate levels (suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism), and the PPARA haplotype and serum free fatty acids are positively related (suggesting decreased fat oxidation). These data suggest that the high-altitude adaptations may offer protection from diabetes at high altitude but increase the risk of diabetes at lower elevations and/or with adoption of a non-traditional diet. It should also be considered in future work in the field that because iron is a cofactor for EGLN1, there may be significant associations of phenotypes with the significant degrees of variation seen in tissue iron among human populations."

Approximately 40% of alcoholics were already drinking heavily in late adolescence. Most cases of alcoholism are established by the age of 30 years with the peak prevalence at 18-23 years of age. Therefore the key time frame for the development, and prevention, of alcoholism lies in adolescence and young adulthood. Severe childhood stressors have been associated with increased vulnerability to addiction, however, not all stress-exposed children go on to develop alcoholism. Origins of resilience can be both genetic (variation in alcohol-metabolizing genes, increased susceptibility to alcohol's sedative effects) and environmental (lack of alcohol availability, positive peer and parental support). Genetic vulnerability is likely to be conferred by multiple genes of small to modest effects, possibly only apparent in gene-environment interactions. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. In addition, a common Met158 variant in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene can confer both risk and resilience to alcoholism in different drinking environments. It is likely that a complex mix of gene(s)-environment(s) interactions underlie addiction vulnerability and development. Risk-resilience factors can best be determined in longitudinal studies, preferably starting during pregnancy. This kind of research is important for planning future measures to prevent harmful drinking in adolescence."

We report a mutation in the gene encoding keratin 14 (KRT14) that changes the predicted amino acid at position 119, at the start of the helix initiation motif, from methionine to threonine (K14 M119T) in a patient with an EBS Dowling-Meara phenotype with severe palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis. This demonstrates that the three major types of EBS can arise from missense mutations in the same codon. The findings suggest that the specific nature of the missense mutation, in the context of the protein sequence, can contribute far more to the clinical severity than previously thought.

DNA was isolated from Tn916-mutagenized cells, and the point of transposon insertion was determined by inverse PCR, DNA sequencing, and mapping to the wild-type genome sequence. Analysis of the insertion sites at the nucleotide level demonstrated a biased pattern of insertion into regions rich in stretches of A's and T's. Although Tn916 integrated at multiple dispersed positions throughout the chromosome, 9 of 10 insertion events occurred in noncoding, intergenic DNA. It was determined that the intergenic DNA was over 5% more A + T-rich than that of protein coding sequences. This suggests that A + T-rich sequences similar to the Tn916 insertion site would be more likely to reside in the intergenic DNA. In an effort to identify other likely sites for transposon integration, a hidden Markov model of the consensus target insertion site was derived from the Tn916-H. influenzae junction fragments and searched against the entire genome. Eighty percent of the 30 highest-scoring predicted Tn916 target sites were from intergenic, nonprotein-coding regions of the genome. These data support the hypothesis that Tn916 has a marked preference for insertion into noncoding DNA for H. influenzae, suggesting that this mobile element has evolved to minimize disruption of host cell function on integration."

The CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stem cell mobilization in cancer and administered for that indication at 0.24 mg/kg, has been shown in short-term (1- to 2-week) phase 1 dose-escalation studies to correct neutropenia and other cytopenias in WHIM syndrome. However, long-term safety and long-term hematologic and clinical efficacy data are lacking. Here we report results from the first long-term clinical trial of plerixafor in any disease, in which 3 adults with WHIM syndrome self-injected 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg (4% to 8% of the FDA-approved dose) subcutaneously twice daily for 6 months. Circulating leukocytes were durably increased throughout the trial in all patients, and this was associated with fewer infections and improvement in warts in combination with imiquimod; however, immunoglobulin levels and specific vaccine responses were not fully restored. No drug-associated side effects were observed. These results provide preliminary evidence for the safety and clinical efficacy of long-term, low-dose plerixafor in WHIM syndrome and support its continued study as mechanism-based therapy in this disease. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for this study is NCT00967785."

Here we present evidence for a new processing pathway, involving novel signal peptidase activities. The mAAA protease subunits Yta10 (Afg3) and Yta12 (Rca1) were identified both to be essential for the first processing step. In addition, the Pcp1 (Ygr101w) gene product was found to be required for the second processing step, yielding the mature Ccp1 protein. The newly identified Pcp1 protein belongs to the rhomboid-GlpG superfamily of putative intramembrane peptidases. Inactivation of the protease motifs in mAAA and Pcp1 blocks the respective steps of proteolysis. A model of coupled Ccp1 transport and N-terminal processing by the mAAA complex and Pcp1 is discussed. Similar processing mechanisms may exist, because the mAAA subunits and the newly identified Pcp1 protein belong to ubiquitous protein families."

We also analyzed its biological function by restoring HIC-1 expression using 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine (5-CdR) and small-activating RNAs for the reversal of HIC-1 tumor suppressive effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. An Agilent Q44h global expressing microarray was probed after restoring the expression of HIC-1. Data demonstrated that HIC-1 expression was reduced significantly in breast cancer tissues. HIC-1 immunohistochemistry resulted in mean staining scores in cancer tissue and normal ductal epithelia of 3.54 and 8.2, respectively (p<0.01). 5-CdR partially reversed HIC-1 expression, and modulated cell growth and apoptosis. dsHIC1-2998, an saRNA, showed activating efficacy in breast cancer cells. A group of differentially expressed genes were characterized by cDNA microarray. Upon saRNA treatment, genes upregulated included those involved in immune activation, cell cycle interference, the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, and cell differentiation. Downregulated genes included oncogenes and those that play roles in cell invasion, cell growth, and cell division.

PCR-RFLP/AFLP, bisulfite-sequencing and real-time PCR approaches were used for genetic, epigenetic and expression analysis respectively. SLE cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls (24.93 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 11.67 \u00b1 0.48 \u03bcmol/l), while plasma folate levels showed no association (7.10 \u00b1 2.49 vs. 7.64 \u00b1 2.09 ng/ml).

The hypermethylation of RFC1 as observed in the current study may contribute for its down regulation. Plasma folate and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat showed an inverse association with methylation of RFC1 and MHC2TA. SLE cases with hypocomplementemia showed hypermethylation of RFC1, hypomethylation/up regulation of MHC2TA and down regulation of HLA-DR. The hypermethylation of MHC2TA and down regulation of RFC1, MHC2TA and HLA-DR were observed in anti-cardiolipin antibody positive SLE cases. The up regulation of RFC1 and HLA-DR was observed in anti-dsDNA antibody positive SLE cases. The hypomethylation/upregulation of RFC1 and MHC2TA was observed in anti-RNP antibody positive cases.

The origins of the bacteria in milk are thought to include the maternal gastrointestinal tract (via an entero-mammary pathway) and through bacterial exposure of the breast during nursing. Currently, almost nothing is known about whether variation in microbe consumption by the infant via human milk and that of the mammary gland, itself, impacts short-term and/or long-term infant and maternal health although several studies suggest this is likely. We urge the clinical and public health communities to be patient, however, in order to allow human milk and lactation researchers to first understand what constitutes 'normal' in terms of the milk microbiome (as well as factors that impact microbial community structure) prior to jumping the gun to investigate if and how this important source of microbes impacts maternal and infant health."

Most were SDE in a single tissue. Surprisingly, nearly half of the probesets that were (SDE) in multiple tissues were oppositely sex biased in different tissues, and most SDE probesets were also expressed without sex bias in other tissues. Two genes were widely SDE: Xist (female-only) and Eif2s3y (male-only). The frequency of SDE probesets varied widely between tissues, and was highest in the duodenum (6.2%), whilst less than 0.05% in over half of the surveyed tissues. The occurrence of SDE probesets was not strongly correlated between tissues. Within individual tissues, however, relational networks of SDE genes were identified. In the liver, networks relating to differential metabolism between the sexes were seen. The estrogen receptor was implicated in differential gene expression in the duodenum. To conclude, sexually dimorphic gene expression is common, but highly tissue-dependent. Sexually dimorphic gene expression may provide insights into mechanisms underlying phenotypic sex differences.

WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23).

To characterize Nup60p further, Nup60p-coated beads were used to capture its interacting proteins from extracts. We find that Nup60p binds to Nup2p and serves as a docking site for Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimers and Kap123p. Nup60p also binds Gsp1p-GTP and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prp20p, and functions as a Gsp1p guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor by reducing the activity of Prp20p. Yeast lacking Nup60p exhibit minor defects in nuclear export of Kap60p, nuclear import of Kap95p-Kap60p-dependent cargoes, and diffusion of small proteins across the NPC. Yeast lacking Nup60p also fail to anchor Nup2p at the NPC, resulting in the mislocalization of Nup2p to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Purified Nup60p and Nup2p bind each other directly, but the stability of the complex is compromised when Kap60p binds Nup2p. Gsp1p-GTP enhances by 10-fold the affinity between Nup60p and Nup2p, and restores binding of Nup2p-Kap60p complexes to Nup60p. The results suggest a dynamic interaction, controlled by the nucleoplasmic concentration of Gsp1p-GTP, between Nup60p and Nup2p at the NPC."

During a 30-min incubation with dbcAMP, Rac1 activity gradually increased throughout the cells and remained at its maximal level. There was no change in PIP(3) concentration. After a 5-h incubation with dbcAMP, Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated at the protruding tips of neurites without PIP(3) accumulation. dbcAMP-induced Rac1 activation was principally mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and Sif- and Tiam1-like exchange factor (STEF)/Tiam2. STEF depletion drastically reduced dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. PKA phosphorylates STEF at three residues (Thr-749, Ser-782, Ser-1562); Thr-749 phosphorylation was critical for dbcAMP-induced Rac1 activation and neurite extension. During dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth, PKA activation at the plasma membrane became localized to neurite tips; this localization may contribute to local Rac1 activation at the same neurite tips. Considering the critical role of Rac1 in neuronal morphogenesis, the PKA-STEF-Rac1 pathway may play a crucial role in cytoskeletal regulation during neurite/axon outgrowth and guidance, which depend on cAMP signals."

A clinical diagnosis is easily established when the chain of infection can be followed. However, Japan is currently experiencing sporadic measles outbreaks, which complicate the establishment of diagnosis. Furthermore, other exanthematous infections such as rubella, human parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7 present with clinical symptoms and IgM antibody levels similar to those in measles. Therefore, real-time polymerase chain reaction virogene testing has been part of Japan's standard diagnostic protocol for measles since 2010. This report presents two pediatric cases clinically resembling measles that were diagnosed as HHV-6 based on a virogene detection test. This underscores the importance of performing pathogen testing to confirm a diagnosis when measles is suspected. "

Some reasons for this relatively low yield include unappreciated phenotypic heterogeneity; locus heterogeneity; somatic and germline mosaicism; variants of uncertain functional significance; technically inaccessible areas of the genome; incorrect mode of inheritance investigated; and inadequate communication between clinicians and basic scientists with knowledge of particular genes, proteins, or biological systems. To facilitate such communication and improve the search for patients or model organisms with similar phenotypes and variants in specific candidate genes, we have developed the Matchmaker Exchange (MME). MME was created to establish a federated network connecting databases of genomic and phenotypic data using a common application programming interface (API). To date, seven databases can exchange data using the API (GeneMatcher, PhenomeCentral, DECIPHER, MyGene2, matchbox, Australian Genomics Health Alliance Patient Archive, and Monarch Initiative; the latter included for model organism matching). This article guides usage of the MME for rare disease gene discovery. \u00a9 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Rather than functioning as oncogenic drivers, their induction in tumour cells predominately promotes survival, chemoresistance and motility. The unique mode of maximal activation of this RTK family requires an extracellular lipid\u2013protein complex. For example, the protein ligand, growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), binds to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) that is externalized on apoptotic cell membranes, which activates MERTK on macrophages. This triggers engulfment of apoptotic material and subsequent anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. In tumours, autocrine and paracrine ligands and apoptotic cells are abundant, which provide a survival signal to the tumour cell and favour an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive microenvironment. Thus, TAM kinase inhibition could stimulate antitumour immunity, reduce tumour cell survival, enhance chemosensitivity and diminish metastatic potential."

Currently, evidences suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. The differential regulation of miRNAs in response to exercise suggests a potential value of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers of physiological mediators of the cardiovascular adaptation induced by exercise. Likewise, serum levels of c-miRNAs such as miR-423-5p have been evaluated as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the manipulation of miRNAs levels using techniques such as 'miR mimics' and 'antagomiRs' is becoming evident the enormous potential of miRNAs as promising therapeutic strategies in heart failure.

Star-PAP directly associated with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 160 and 73 subunits and also the targeted pre-mRNA. In vitro and in vivo Star-PAP was required for the stable association of CPSF complex to pre-mRNA and then CPSF 73 specifically cleaved the mRNA at the 3'-cleavage site. This mechanism is distinct from canonical PAP\u03b1, which is recruited to the cleavage complex by interacting with CPSF 160. The data support a model where Star-PAP binds to the RNA, recruits the CPSF complex to the 3'-end of pre-mRNA and then defines cleavage by CPSF 73 and subsequent polyadenylation of its target mRNAs."

Treatment with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies has been exploited in several cancer immunotherapy studies in mice and led to the development of anti-CD40 antibodies for clinical use. Here, Dacetuzumab and Lucatumumab are in the most advanced stage and are being tested as treatment for malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The promising results from these early clinical trials have encouraged clinical drug development in order to investigate the effect of CD40 mAbs in combination with other cancer immunotherapies, in particular interleukin (IL)-2. An in-depth analysis of this immunotherapy is provided elsewhere. In the present review, we provide an update of the most recent clinical trials with anti-CD40 antibodies.

The augmentation of pro-inflammatory activity is mostly attributed to p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK. In our study, these activated macrophages are found to induce phagosome maturation when infected with pathogenic Leishmania donovani. Increased co-localization of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labeled pathogenic L. donovani with Lysosome was found. Moreover, increased co-localization was observed between pathogenic L. donovani and late phagosomal markers viz. Rab7, Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1, Cathepsin D, Rab9, and V-ATPase which indicate phagosome maturation. It was also observed that inhibition of V-type ATPase caused significant hindrance in attenuated Leishmania induced phagosome maturation. Finally, it was confirmed that p38 MAPK is the key player in acidification and maturation of phagosome in attenuated Leishmania strain pre-exposed macrophages. To our knowledge, this study for the first time reported an approach to induce phagosome maturation in L. donovani infected macrophages which could potentiate short-term prophylactic response in future.

MICs were determined using CLSI methods. A neutropenic murine lung infection model was utilized for all treatment studies, and drug dosing was by the subcutaneous route. Single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics was determined in the mouse model after administration of 2.5, 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg. For in vivo studies, 4-fold-increasing doses of delafloxacin (range, 0.03 to 160 mg/kg) were administered every 6 h (q6h) to infected mice. Treatment outcome was measured by determining organism burden in the lung (CFU counts) at the end of each experiment (24 h). The Hill equation for maximum effect (Emax) was used to model the dose-response data. The magnitude of the PK/PD index, the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC), associated with net stasis and 1-log kill endpoints was determined in the lung model for all isolates. MICs ranged from 0.004 to 1 mg/liter. Single-dose PK parameter ranges include the following: for maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax), 2 to 70.7 mg/liter; AUC from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-\u221e), 2.8 to 152 mg \u00b7 h/liter; half-life (t1/2), 0.7 to 1 h. At the start of therapy mice had 6.3 \u00b1 0.09 log10 CFU/lung. In control mice the organism burden increased 2.1 \u00b1 0.44 log10 CFU/lung over the study period. There was a relatively steep dose-response relationship observed with escalating doses of delafloxacin. Maximal organism reductions ranged from 2 log10 to more than 4 log10 The median free-drug AUC/MIC magnitude associated with net stasis for each species group was 1.45, 0.56, and 40.3 for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae, respectively. AUC/MIC targets for the 1-log kill endpoint were 2- to 5-fold higher. Delafloxacin demonstrated in vitro and in vivo potency against a diverse group of pathogens, including those with phenotypic drug resistance to other classes. These results have potential relevance for clinical dose selection and evaluation of susceptibility breakpoints for delafloxacin for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections involving these pathogens."

However, the specific immune mechanisms underlying these responses remain incompletely defined. The majority of these studies have focused on the effect of CDNs on immune cells but have not conclusively interrogated the role of stromal cells in the acute rejection of the CDN-injected tumor. Here, we revealed a mechanism of STING agonist-mediated tumor response that relied on both stromal and immune cells to achieve tumor regression and clearance. Using knockout and bone marrow chimeric mice, we showed that although bone marrow-derived TNF\u03b1 was necessary for CDN-induced necrosis, STING signaling in radioresistant stromal cells was also essential for CDN-mediated tumor rejection. These results provide evidence for crosstalk between stromal and hematopoietic cells during CDN-mediated tumor collapse after i.t. administration. These mechanistic insights may prove critical in the clinical development of STING agonists. "

However, detection of LOH is frequently hampered by the presence of normal cell components within tumor specimens and the limitation in availability of constitutive DNA. Here, we describe a simple but highly sensitive method for genomewide detection of allelic composition, based on the Affymetrix single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotyping microarray platform, without dependence on the availability of constitutive DNA. By sensing subtle distortions in allele-specific signals caused by allelic imbalance with the use of anonymous controls, sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination of allele-specific copy numbers, even in the presence of up to 70%-80% normal cell contamination. The performance of the new algorithm, called \"AsCNAR\" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity of cancer genomes and should contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of human cancers."

It is best classified as a type of plasma cell dyscrasia with paraneoplastic manifestations, similar to POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin abnormalities). To date, 11 patients have been identified. This is the first morphologic review of TEMPI syndrome bone marrow samples, in order to define pathologic features that may aid in the recognition of the syndrome and to identify post-therapy changes. Seven bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from three patients, including two post-treatment marrows, were examined. Patients were 36, 49, and 49 years old at time of diagnosis. In all cases, erythropoietin levels were extremely elevated at >5000\u2009IU/l, the paraprotein was IgG kappa, JAK2 V617F was negative and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were normal. In one case, the increase in clonal plasma cells reached levels of smoldering myeloma (18%), but remaining marrows showed few monoclonal plasma cells (<5%). All pre-treatment biopsies showed erythroid hyperplasia, with mild nonspecific megakaryocytic, and erythroid cytologic atypia in one marrow. Prominent plasma cell vacuolization and reactive-appearing lymphoid aggregates were noted in one case. Findings of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including megakaryocyte clusters and fibrosis, were not identified. In conclusion, TEMPI syndrome should be considered when erythrocytosis and plasma cell dyscrasia coexist. The bone marrow findings, although nonspecific, differ significantly from polycythemia vera. Peculiar clinical and laboratorial findings of TEMPI, including elevated erythropoietin and normal vascular endothelial growth factor level, allow the diagnosis and distinction from POEMS syndrome. Significant decrease in erythropoietin level following treatment suggests a role of erythropoietin in monitoring therapeutic response."

Here we demonstrate an important resistance mechanism initiated from tumor-induced bone. Studies using an osteogenic patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b, revealed that tumor cells resistant to cabozantinib, a Met and VEGFR-2 inhibitor, reside in a \"resistance niche\" adjacent to prostate cancer-induced bone. We performed secretome analysis of the conditioned medium from tumor-induced bone to identify proteins (termed \"osteocrines\") found within this resistance niche. In accordance with previous reports demonstrating that activation of integrin signaling pathways confers therapeutic resistance, 27 of the 90 osteocrines identified were integrin ligands. We found that following cabozantinib treatment, only tumor cells positioned adjacent to the newly formed woven bone remained viable and expressed high levels of pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425, mediators of integrin signaling. Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4 cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397 expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. Moreover, treatment of MDA-PCa-118b tumors with PF-562271 led to decreased tumor growth, irrespective of initial tumor size. Finally, we show that upon treatment cessation, the combination of PF-562271 and cabozantinib delayed tumor recurrence in contrast to cabozantinib treatment alone. Our studies suggest that identifying paracrine de novo resistance mechanisms may significantly contribute to the generation of a broader set of potent therapeutic tools that act combinatorially to inhibit metastatic prostate cancer."

We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation."

We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization."

To identify novel pairings for duvelisib in HM, it was evaluated alone and in combination with 35 compounds comprising a diverse panel of standard-of-care agents and emerging drugs in development for HM. These compounds were tested in 20 cell lines including diffuse large B-cell, follicular, T-cell, and mantle cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Single agent activity was seen in fourteen cell lines, with a median GI50 of 0.59 \u03bcM. A scalar measure of the strength of synergistic drug interactions revealed a synergy hit rate of 19.3% across the matrix of drug combinations and cell lines. Synergy with duvelisib was prominent in lymphoma lines with approved and emerging drugs used to treat HM, including dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Western blotting revealed that certain duvelisib-treated cell lines showed inhibition of phosphorylated (p) AKT at serine 473 only out to 12 hours, with mTORC2 dependent re-phosphorylation of pAKT evident at 24 hours. Combination with dexamethasone or ibrutinib, however, prevented this reactivation leading to durable inhibition of pAKT. The combination treatments also inhibited downstream signaling effectors pPRAS40 and pS6. The combination of duvelisib with dexamethasone also significantly reduced p-4EBP1, which controls cap dependent translation initiation, leading to decreased levels of c-MYC 6 hours after treatment. In support of the in vitro studies, in vivo xenograft studies revealed that duvelisib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus led to greater tumor growth inhibition compared to single agent administration. These data provide a rationale for exploring multiple combinations in the clinic and suggest that suppression of mTOR-driven survival signaling may be one important mechanism for combination synergy."

In this endeavor, an in depth analysis of shotgun experiments might represent a valuable resource to select a biological matrix in design validation experiments. In this work, we used all the proteomic experiments from the NCI60 cell lines and applied an integrative approach based on the results obtained from Comet, Mascot, OMSSA, and X!Tandem. This workflow benefits from the complementarity of these search engines to increase the proteome coverage. Five missing proteins C-HPP guidelines compliant were identified, although further validation is needed. Moreover, 165 missing proteins were detected with only one unique peptide, and their functional analysis supported their participation in cellular pathways as was also proposed in other studies. Finally, we performed a combined analysis of the gene expression levels and the proteomic identifications from the common cell lines between the NCI60 and the CCLE project to suggest alternatives for further validation of missing protein observations."

Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the\u2009>80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P\u2009=\u20090.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P\u2009=\u20090.0005 and P\u2009=\u20090.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation."

Many single-tablet regimens (STRs), including newer fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets, are available, offering patients several options for choosing a treatment regimen that works best for them. Given these changes, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment, achieve better clinical outcomes, and experience both fewer side effects and drug-drug interactions. Newer STRs include dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC)/abacavir (ABC) (Triumeq; Viiv Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC), rilpivirine (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) (Odefsey; Gilead, Foster City, CA), RPV/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (Complera; Gilead), elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TDF (Stribild; Gilead), and EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya; Gilead). Recently approved FDCs, such as atazanavir (ATV)/COBI (Evotaz; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), darunavir (DRV)/COBI (Prezcobix; Janssen Products, Titusville NJ), and FTC/TAF (Descovy; Gilead), are also now available. The Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for HIV recommend many of these integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) STRs as a preferred choice for initiation of treatment in both ART-naive and -experienced patients because they offer comparably faster rates of virologic suppression, reduced rates of resistance development (especially with DTG), and overall better adherence than protease inhibitors or NNRTIs. Numerous phase 3 clinical trials support these recommendations including several switch or simplification clinical trials. Notably, the novel pharmacokinetic booster COBI, with its water soluble properties, has enabled the development and coformulation of a few of these STRs and FDCs. Also, a newer tenofovir salt formulation, TAF, has an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile, contributing to better overall renal and bone tolerability compared with TDF. Further simplification regimens comprising dual ART therapies are currently being explored. This review provides an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety data for these coformulated agents, highlighting the relative impact on comparative adverse events, assessing the potential for experiencing fewer drug-drug interactions, and discussing the clinical implications regarding adherence to treatment."

Vaccination against these toxins is considered the best way to combat the CDAD. Recently, a novel tetravalent C. difficile vaccine candidate containing all four toxins produced from a baculovirus expression system has been developed. A dose assay to release this tetravalent C. difficile vaccine was developed using tandem ion-exchange HPLC chromatography. A sequential weak cation exchange (carboxyl group) and weak anion exchange (tertiary amine group) columns were employed. The four C. difficile vaccine antigen pIs range from 4.4 to 8.6. The final optimized separation employs salt gradient elution at two different pHs. The standard analytical parameters such as LOD, LOQ, linearity, accuracy, precision and repeatability were evaluated for this method and it was deemed acceptable as a quantitative assay for vaccine release. Furthermore, the developed method was utilized for monitoring the stability of the tetravalent C. difficile vaccine in final container."

The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI."

The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral).

Up to 70% of annotated genes in plants undergo APA. Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants. "

A number of synthetic peptides that encompass different regions of apoE have been studied for inhibiting inflammatory states, including Alzheimer disease. However, peptides that clear atherogenic lipoproteins, analogous to apoE, via enhanced hepatic uptake have not been previously reviewed. Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2). This peptide consists of residues 141-150, the putative receptor-binding region of human apoE, covalently linked to a well characterized class A amphipathic helix, 18A, which has no sequence homology to any other exchangeable apolipoprotein sequences. It demonstrates dramatic effects in reducing plasma cholesterol levels in dyslipidemic mouse and rabbit models. We discuss the scientific rationale and review the literature for the design and efficacy of the peptide. Analogous to apoE, this peptide bypasses the low-density lipoprotein receptor for the hepatic uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins via heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors. Therefore, this and similar peptides may be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders such as familial hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis."

Here, we describe latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are unbound by TFs and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers but acquire these features in response to stimulation. Macrophage stimulation caused sequential binding of stimulus-activated and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer marks. Once unveiled, many of these enhancers did not return to a latent state when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents."

We show that lactotransferrin mRNA is expressed by Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) cells in the bone marrow, as opposed to hematopoietic stem cells or any peripheral cell population. To follow the progeny of lactotransferrin-expressing bone marrow cells, we generated a mouse model in which a reporter gene is irreversibly activated from the lactotransferrin-promoter. We found that lactotransferrin-reporter labels a majority of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and distinct subtypes of dendritic cells, while excluding T, B, natural killer cells, interferon-producing killer dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, erythrocytes and eosinophils. Lactotransferrin-reporter(-) bone marrow cells retain lymphoid, erythroid and long-term repopulating potential, while lactotransferrin-reporter(+) bone marrow cells confer only myeloid, but not lymphoid potential.

Morphine is the current gold standard analgesic acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs, (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce analgesia with reduced tolerance. The type of response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone and naltrindole as above) and the space between them. Production and evaluation of bivalent ligands is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are designed not to be highly selective morphine-like (MOP) ligands represents a new avenue for the production of useful drugs for chronic (and in particular cancer) pain."

However, little is known about the effects and mechanisms of SST in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, a model of PD was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats in order to investigate the effects of SST on LPS-induced degeneration of DA in vivo. Intramural injection of LPS resulted in a significant loss of DA neurons, while reduction of neuronal death by SST pretreatment was confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl. In parallel, immunohistochemical detection of OX-42 and hydroethidine staining were employed to determine the activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. It was found that SST inhibited the LPS-induced microglial activity and ROS production. ELISA revealed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and prostaglandin E2 when SST was administered prior to LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p-p65 was attenuated by administration of SST prior to LPS application. The results indicated that LPS-induced loss of nigral DA neurons was inhibited by SST and the observed effects of SST on neuroprotection were associated with suppression of microglial activation and the NF-\u03baB pathway, ensuing decreases of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The present study therefore suggested that SST is beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, through inhibiting the activation of microglia."

A key determinant of the activity of both natural and engineered microorganisms in vivo is their location within the host organism. However, existing methods for imaging cellular location and function, primarily based on optical reporter genes, have limited deep tissue performance owing to light scattering or require radioactive tracers. Here we introduce acoustic reporter genes, which are genetic constructs that allow bacterial gene expression to be visualized in vivo using ultrasound, a widely available inexpensive technique with deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. These constructs are based on gas vesicles, a unique class of gas-filled protein nanostructures that are expressed primarily in water-dwelling photosynthetic organisms as a means to regulate buoyancy. Heterologous expression of engineered gene clusters encoding gas vesicles allows Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium to be imaged noninvasively at volumetric densities below 0.01% with a resolution of less than 100\u2009\u03bcm. We demonstrate the imaging of engineered cells in vivo in proof-of-concept models of gastrointestinal and tumour localization, and develop acoustically distinct reporters that enable multiplexed imaging of cellular populations. This technology equips microbial cells with a means to be visualized deep inside mammalian hosts, facilitating the study of the mammalian microbiome and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic cellular agents."

In contrast to other isoforms, cofilin-2 efficiently binds and disassembles both ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin filaments. We mapped surface-exposed cofilin-2-specific residues required for ATP-actin binding and propose that these residues function as an \"actin nucleotide-state sensor\" among ADF/cofilins. The results suggest that cofilin-2 evolved specific biochemical and cellular properties that allow it to control actin dynamics in sarcomeres, where filament pointed ends may contain a mixture of ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin subunits. Our findings also offer a rationale for why cofilin-2 mutations in humans lead to myopathies. "

The UHRF1 C-terminal RING finger functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase to establish histone H3 ubiquitination at Lys18 and/or Lys23, which is subsequently recognized by DNMT1 to promote its localization onto replication foci. Here, we present the crystal structure of DNMT1 RFTS domain in complex with ubiquitin and highlight a unique ubiquitin binding mode for the RFTS domain. We provide evidence that UHRF1 N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) also binds directly to DNMT1. Despite sharing a high degree of structural similarity, UHRF1 UBL and ubiquitin bind to DNMT1 in a very distinct fashion and exert different impacts on DNMT1 enzymatic activity. We further show that the UHRF1 UBL-mediated interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1, and the binding of DNMT1 to ubiquitinated histone H3 that is catalyzed by UHRF1 RING domain are critical for the proper subnuclear localization of DNMT1 and maintenance of DNA methylation. Collectively, our study adds another layer of complexity to the regulatory mechanism of DNMT1 activation by UHRF1 and supports that individual domains of UHRF1 participate and act in concert to maintain DNA methylation patterns."
