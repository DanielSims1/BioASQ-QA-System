The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative modelCoding sequence mutations in e.g. RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) as well as syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR). Furthermore, mutations in the RET gene are responsible for approximately half of the familial and some sporadic cases, strongly suggesting, on the one hand, the importance of non-coding variations and, on the other hand, that additional genes involved in the development of the enteric nervous system still await their discoveryFor almost all of the identified HSCR genes incomplete penetrance of the HSCR phenotype has been reported, probably due to modifier loci. Therefore, HSCR has become a model for a complex oligo-/polygenic disorder in which the relationship between different genes creating a non-mendelian inheritance pattern still remains to be elucidated Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes."

We refer to the elements as 'Olfactores conserved non-coding elements'We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand.

Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6\u00a0months (range: 21-63.8\u00a0months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5\u00a0months (range: 6.8-51.2\u00a0months).

CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs."

We have prioritized 60 cis-eQTLs and confirmed differential expression between the parental strains by quantitative PCR in 43 (72%) of the eQTL transcripts.These colocalizing correlated cis-eQTLs (c3-eQTLs) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the colocalizing pQTLs.

These SNPs, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent strong candidate factors underlying not just eQTL expression phenotypes, but also the correlated metabolic and physiological traits. In conclusion, by integration of genomic sequence, eQTL and QTT datasets we have identified several genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological traits observed in the SHR strain.Identifying associations between genotypes and gene expression levels using microarrays has enabled systematic interrogation of regulatory variation underlying complex phenotypes. This approach has vast potential for functional characterization of disease states, but its prohibitive cost, given hundreds to thousands of individual samples from populations have to be genotyped and expression profiled, has limited its widespread application.RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that genomic regions with allele-specific expression (ASE) detected by sequencing cDNA are highly enriched for cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) identified by profiling of 500 animals in parallel, with up to 90% agreement on the allele that is preferentially expressed. We also observed widespread noncoding and antisense ASE and identified several allele-specific alternative splicing variants.CONCLUSION: Monitoring ASE by sequencing cDNA from as little as one sample is a practical alternative to expression genetics for mapping cis-acting variation that regulates RNA transcription and processing.The six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized MS and even tumor susceptibility. Our findings suggest that the six genes may play important roles in the pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and the MS, which increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The use of the multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for the pleiotropic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiological pathway.To elucidate mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), we studied genetic regulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats, assuming a conservation of pathogenic pathways. In this study, we focused on Eae23, originally identified to regulate EAE in a (LEW.1AV1xPVG.1AV1)F2 cross. Our aim was to determine whether one or more genes within the 67 Mb region regulate EAE and to define candidate risk genes.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used high resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in the 10th generation (G10) of an advanced intercross line (AIL) to resolve Eae23 into two QTLs that independently regulate EAE, namely Eae23a and Eae23b.

Here, we report that the balance between the reparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGF\u03b2 signaling. Thus, TGF\u03b2 signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration.As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts. This diminution in profibrotic TGF-beta signaling resulted in the attenuation of adverse structural remodeling as assessed by echocardiography.Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1). Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging."

Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent.Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties.Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti-arrhythmic effects, is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias."

These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight."

                    "context": "he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images.A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, \u2026,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods.hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples. In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes."

Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined. The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect.

In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions.Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state."

The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involvedSister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis IIIn budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis"

More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed. This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome. Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals. "

This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia.Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress.

Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake."

This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory.Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality.Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise."

Finally, we provide evidence that E2F1 upregulates SC35 in response to DNA-damaging agents and show that SC35 is required for apoptosis in response to these drugs.This analysis revealed that DNA damage resulted in changes in splicing activity that modified the splicing pattern of Fas, a key pro-apoptotic, p53-inducible death receptor.Bortezomib induces mitochondrial damage in native cells and also activates the UPR by splicing of Xbp-1 and induction of CHOP, which is significantly reduced by silencing of MUC4.The tumour-suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis.

The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general."

Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known.The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM.According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy.Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium.In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis."

Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves. It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS. Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').

To investigate the biological characteristics of field isolates of Borna disease virus (BDV), as well as to understand BDV infections outside endemic countries, we isolated the virus from brain samples of a heifer with Borna disease in Japan.Neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection of the rat brain is associated with microglial activation and damage to the certain neuronal populations.In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10. Taken together, the present data are the first in vitro evidence that persistent BDV infection of neurons and astrocytes rather than direct exposure to the virus or dying neurons is critical for activating microglia.Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells."

The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.All three elements insert only rarely within many Polycomb-regulated regions, a property that may contribute to the origin of \"transposon-free regions\" (TFRs) in metazoan genomes.Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length.RESULTS: Here we report that transposon-free regions (TFRs) are prominent genomic features of amphibian and fish lineages, and that many have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, although most transposon-derived sequences have entered these lineages after their divergence.

CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials.BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI. There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35).

One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus. (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested.West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains.

While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells.Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease."

Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine.Quantification of human urinary exosomes by nanoparticle tracking analysis.Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are released by cells throughout the nephron and contain biomolecules from their cells of origin.Urinary exosomes have been proposed as potential diagnostic tools."

In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels.Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA.Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy.Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts."

In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas.RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50). TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas.Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age."

We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies.This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy.Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness."

The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition.The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors"

The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity.The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays.The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection"

These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis.Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown.Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation.Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin"

Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs.Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time."

Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some casesMoebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groupsCertain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism. This is the case of the following syndromes: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 15q11-q13 duplication, fragile X syndrome, fragile X premutation, deletion of chromosome 2q, XYY syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Apert syndrome, mutations in the ARX gene, De Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, Rett syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Steinert disease, tuberous sclerosis, Duchenne's disease, Timothy syndrome, 10p terminal deletion, Cowden syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, Myhre syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome, Moebius syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, neurofibromatosis type 1, CHARGE syndrome and HEADD syndrome.Seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism. Some 40% of the group showed all or many of the symptoms typical of autistic disorderFifty-nine cases with infantile autism/autistic disorder were subclassified according to associated medical condition (fragile-X, tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, hypo-melanosis of Ito, Moebius syndrome, Rett syndrome, and a 'new' syndrome associated with a marker chromosome)."

Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pumpHere we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis.Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure.Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium."

Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptidesHere we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain.

Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated.Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended.Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery."

On the loci of two developmental transcription factor genes, SOX3 and PAX6, we demonstrate that HCNEs conserved between human and zebrafish can be systematically and reliably tested for their regulatory function in multiple stable transgenes in zebrafish, and their genomic reach estimated with confidence using synteny conservation and HCNE density along these loci.

RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure.The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL."

Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards. In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention.High levels of \u03b1-tocopherol in serum were associated with 30% lower CAD risk in another study (HR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53-0.94). Among minerals (zinc, selenium, and chromium), an inverse association between zinc and CAD was observed; levels lower than 14.1 \u00b5mol/L were associated with an increased risk for CAD (RR 1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.38).The information available on this issue is scarce.

Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle. The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential.The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process."

Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation.Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling."

Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of cardiac hypertrophy such as aortic banding and myocardial infarction. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) null mice are often used as a model for human dilated cardiomyopathy.A lack of MLP leads to an age-dependent impairment of excitation-contraction coupling with resulting contractile dysfunction and secondary fibrosis.Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function.Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation."

NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B.Contradictory results have been reported regarding NS3 in RNA synthesis. To investigate the effect of NS3 on classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) activity and NS3-NS5B interaction, RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses containing NS5B and either of NS3 protein and the different truncated NS3 mutants were performed, respectively. We found that NS3 stimulated NS5B RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner by binding to NS5 through a NS3 protease domain. Furthermore, mapping important regions of the NS3 protease domain was carried out by deletion mutagenesis, associated with RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Results showed that stimulation of CSFV NS5B RdRp activity was obtained by NS3 binding to NS5B through a 31-amino acid fragment at the N-terminal end of NS3 protease domain, which mediated a specific NS3-NS5B interaction.The protocols detailed in this unit are used to purify three recombinant enzymes that are widely used in HCV research: the HCV NS3 protease domain, the helicase domain as an NS3+NS4A complex, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The active enzymes are purified to homogeneity by two-column chromatography to support a screening program for HCV inhibitors.Among potential targets are viral entry factors, including scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) and CD81, as well as neutralizing antibodies against the viral glycoproteins. Popular targets related to translation and replication are the NS3/4A protease (inhibited by telaprevir and boceprevir) and the NS5B polymerase, as well as the NS2/3 autoprotease, the NS3 helicase, and nonenzymatic targets such as NS4B and NS5A proteins. The NS3 helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 2.5\u03bcM. Since NS3 and NS5 are required for DENV replication, this fascile assay could be used to screen for non-nucleoside, allosteric inhibitors that disrupt the interaction between the two proteins."

Although alcohol consumption is related to increased cancer risk, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that an intake of 10% alcohol for 4 weeks in rats is genotoxic due to induction of micronuclei. Acetaldehyde (AA), the first product of ethanol metabolism, is believed to be responsible for DNA damage induced by alcohol. Although efficiency of these repair processes substantially decrease the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies that target DNA, compromised DNA repair contributes to mutagenesis and genomic instability leading to carcinogenesis.damage response and repair pathways are important barriers to carcinogenesis.

Electron microscopy further demonstrated interdigitation of the neighboring cell membranes, desmosomes, and intracytoplasmic filaments, which are pathognomonic findings of meningiomas.Unlike SFT, FMs were glycogen-containing and variously exhibited a storiform pattern (13 of 20), psammoma body formation (9 of 20), and calcification of collagen (4 of 20).

Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses.For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely. "

Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups.158 patients (26\u00b72%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25\u00b73%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b703, 95% CI 0\u00b785-1\u00b725). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b786-1\u00b708). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended. There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes. Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial.tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Hyperoxaluria in patients with JIB was found to be a result of hyperabsorption of oxalate, and these patients displayed altered oxalate kinetics with continued urinary excretion of orally administered 14C-oxalate for more than 48 hours. Malabsorption of calcium and low fasting urinary calcium excretion in the JIB patients were associated with high tubular reabsorption of calcium, the latter presumably attributable to a compensatory increase in circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most recurrent renal stone formers the urinary calcium concentration was increased, with an inverse relationship to serum PTH, indicating intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium. A"

Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancerIn the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factoriesBased on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear spaceactive polymerases cluster into replication and transcription \"factories\" in both pro- and eukaryotes. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairsSince the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei.

Citrullination of proteins is well described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and hypercitrullination of proteins may be related to inflammation in general. Some ACPA are remarkably effective as diagnostics in autoimmune disorders, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent. "

A.

The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlationMoreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORISCTCF and BORIS in genome regulation and cancer.The novel BORIS + CTCF gene family is uniquely involved in the epigenetics of normal biology and cancer."

Single channel recordings of RyRs from WT and JCN-KO cardiac SR indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal [Ca(2+)]: at low luminal [Ca(2+)] (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal [Ca(2+)]; conversely, high luminal [Ca(2+)] turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. Thus, junctin produces complex effects on Ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal [Ca(2+)]-dependent dual response of junctin-devoid RyRs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of RyR channels at low luminal [Ca(2+)], and as an inhibitor at high luminal [Ca(2+)].Normal Ca(2+) signalling in skeletal muscle depends on the membrane associated proteins triadin and junctin and their ability to mediate functional interactions between the Ca(2+) binding protein calsequestrin and the type 1 ryanodine receptor in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.We show here that purified skeletal ryanodine receptors are similarly activated by purified triadin or purified junctin added to their luminal side, although a lack of competition indicated that the proteins act at independent sites.

After administration of isoproterenol under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality (2 of 10, 20%). In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%). K201 markedly suppressed both the isoproterenol-induced and the reperfusion-induced VAs, whereas diltiazem did not suppress the isoproterenol-induced VA.JTV519 (K201) is a newly developed 1,4-benzothiazepine drug with antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective properties. It appears to be very effective in not only preventing but also in reversing the characteristic myocardial changes and preventing lethal arrhythmias.The novel antiarrhythmic drug K201 (4-[3-{1-(4-benzyl)piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride) is currently in development for treatment of atrial fibrillation. K201 not only controls intracellular calcium release by the ryanodine receptors, but also possesses a ventricular action that might predispose to torsade de pointes arrhythmias. "

TR\u03b11 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood. AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TR\u03b11 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function.These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy.TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response."

This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother."

Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.

To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM.Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1. Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle. Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes. "

Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human.Pharmacogenomics genes can be divided into drug target genes termed as pharmacodynamics genes (PD) and genes involved in drug transport and metabolism termed as pharmacokinetics genes (PK). To clarify the regulatory potential of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by miRNAs of PK and PD genes.Our analysis identify a striking difference in the level of miRNA regulation between PK and PD genes, with the former having less than half predicted conserved miRNA binding sites compared with the latter. Importantly, this finding is reflected in a highly significant difference in the shift in expression levels of PD versus PK genes after depletion of miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes an intrinsic difference between PK and PD genes and helps clarify the role of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics."

Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.  In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma."

Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration. The stridor was specific to MSA. Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure.Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.

The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies. -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54). In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome.Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. "

Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates.While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated.While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated"

The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and others have multiple origins of replication.Results from this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of replication.Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified.

We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. While hypomethylated DMRs did not correlate to any particular functional category of genes, the hypermethylated DMRs were strongly associated with genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions and satellite repeats were hypomethylated in the NSCLC samples. We also identified DMRs that were specific to two of the major subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of non-small cell lung carcinomas.Genomewide DNA methylation analysis identifies novel methylated genes in non-small-cell lung carcinomas."

We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC).In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103).Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA\u2022DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA."

In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31).Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088).

Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, \u03b3-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, \u03b3-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes.In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injuryAlong with \u03b2-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid \u03b2-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid \u03b2-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, \u03b3-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that \u03b3-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposureHigh physiological concentrations of A\u03b2 monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks \u03b3-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize \u03b3-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-\u00e0-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration.Aggregated forms of A\u03b2 have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the A\u03b2 levels by inhibiting \u03b3-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of \u03b3-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the \u03b3-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection"

Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu. In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577. Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors).

Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.  In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection. More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.

Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islandsSegmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomesHighly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genesPreliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of \"putative\" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants"

Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation. Recently high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an efficient, better tolerated form of NIV, allowing better access to the baby's face, which may improve nursing, feeding and bonding.In conclusion, there is a growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV.

CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction.Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription.In the recent years, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart.Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth. Sustained and excessive activation of CaMKII during cardiac disease has, however, been linked to arrhythmias, and maladaptive cardiac remodeling, eventually leading to heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death.

Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling.NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers. The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling.T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). "

Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing \u2265 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by \"fail\" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening.Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03).Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity.The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis.We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss."

Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation.Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins.SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes. Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes. "

The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product. Muenke syndrome caused by point mutation (C749G) in the FGFR3 gene affects 1 in 30,000 newborns and accounts for 25% to 30% of genetic causes of craniosynostosis.Phenotypic variability in two families of Muenke syndrome with FGFR3 mutation."

Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model.Zebrafish enhancer detection (ZED) vector: a new tool to facilitate transgenesis and the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafishZebrafish enhancer detection (ZED) vector: a new tool to facilitate transgenesis and the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish."

Here we analyzed data from hundreds of mouse and human samples included in the FANTOM5 project, to identify transcript initiation sites, expression levels, expression correlations and regulatory regions of the three genes.RESULTS: Our investigations reveal the predominantly used transcription start sites (TSSs) for each gene including novel transcription start sites for FOXG1. We show that FOXG1 expression is poorly correlated with the expression of MECP2 and CDKL5. We identify promoter shapes for each TSS, the predicted location of enhancers for each gene and the common transcription factors likely to regulate the three genes.

There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation. In humans, tumors can rely in reactivation of telomerase or originate in a telomerase positive stem/progenitor cell, or rely in alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent telomere-length maintenance mechanism. Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies.Telomeres progressively shorten throughout life. A hallmark of advanced malignancies is the ability for continuous cell divisions that almost universally correlates with the stabilization of telomere length by the reactivation of telomerase.Telomerase-mediated telomere elongation provides cell populations with the ability to proliferate indefinitely.

The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses.Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1.mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotypeHere we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1"

Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity.

Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development.

Ophthalmic surveillance, every 6 or 12 months is important, in patients with ocular melanocytosis for early detection of high risk diseases. One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma.In the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (ODM) and uveal melanoma is well recognized. Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of the eyelid, or the orbit.

Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered \u03b2-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and \u03b2-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development.Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development.Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor."

Together, these data establish the importance of SKA2 for cortisol stress responsivity and the development of PTSD and provide further evidence that SKA2 is a promising biomarker for stress-related disorders including PTSD. Results provide novel support for PTSD-related accelerated aging in DNAm and extend the evidence base of known DNAm age correlates to the domains of neural integrity and cognition.We investigated serum DNA methylation patterns in genomic repetitive elements, LINE-1 and Alu, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases and controls who were US military service members recently deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.In light of its role in glucocorticoid receptor transactivation, we investigated whether SKA2 DNA methylation influences cortisol stress reactivity and is involved in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These results suggest that alterations in global methylation pattern are involved in behavioural adaptation to environmental stress and pinpoint Dlgap2 as a possible target in PTSD."

This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA.Numerous circRNAs were specifically expressed at different lactation stages, and only 1,314 circRNAs were detected at both lactation stages."

It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that IORT can contribute to successful tumor treatment while neither increasing peri-operative morbidity nor subacute sequelae.This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)."

We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery.CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation.Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78\u00a0% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36\u00a0% of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations.The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse."

Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry.DNA replication through hard-to-replicate sites, including both highly transcribed RNA Pol II and Pol III genes, requires the S. pombe Pfh1 helicase.Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II.

We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development.T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders.T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs.Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism."

The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy."

We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets\u00a0(Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate\u00a0valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate\u00a0valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate\u00a0valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations."

Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR.The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs."

Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression."

A 73-year-old woman with known MM who received little treatment for several years, presented secondary to dysarthria and at first was thought to have hyperviscosity syndrome.  After a comprehensive evaluation ruled out common causes of acute renal failure, the patient underwent testing with a bone survey, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and immunoelectrophoresis for suspected plasma cell dyscrasia and received plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome and nephrotoxicity, which resulted in improved renal function. Lab results showed monoclonal gammopathy, elevated serum free light chains, and Bence Jones protein in the urine with a follow-up bone marrow biopsy indicating plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and was started on chemotherapy and immunosuppression.

A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINC-PINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1.We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis.Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa."

Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168\u00a0mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose>500\u00a0mg/dL and ketones of 80\u00a0mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93\u00a0mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36\u00a0h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis with Persistent Diuresis Treated with Canagliflozin.We herein report the case of a 27-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes who was treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (canagliflozin) who developed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and persistent diuresis in the absence of hyperglycemia.Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly.Severe Ketoacidosis Associated with Canagliflozin (Invokana): A Safety Concern."

We provide evidence that DLX2 directly drives Gad1, Gad2, and Vgat expression, and show that mutants had reduced mIPSC amplitude. In addition, the mutants formed fewer GABAergic synapses on excitatory neurons and had reduced mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, Dlx1/2 CKO had hypoplastic dendrites, fewer excitatory synapses, and reduced excitatory input. We provide evidence that some of these phenotypes were due to reduced expression of GRIN2B (a subunit of the NMDA receptor), a high confidence Autism gene.

In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expressionWe hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs.Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs."

In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites.Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations.Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants and tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments across multiple complex human diseases."

It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue.The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis.

MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo.The results highlight a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in pigmentation and protection against melanoma."

IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These data reveal a central role of IL11 in fibrosis and we propose inhibition of IL11 as a new therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis."

TRPM2 is involved in Ca2+signaling in various cells as an endogenous redox sensor for oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, and contributes to cytokine production, insulin release, motility, Ca2+entry and Ca2+-dependent cellular reactions such as endothelial hyper-permeability and apoptosis.We show here that the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPM2 is expressed in the phagosomal membrane and regulates macrophage bactericidal activity through the activation of phagosomal acidificationThe transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients.TRPM2 is a recently identified TRPM family cation channel which is unique among known ion channels in that it contains a C-terminal domain which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase and possesses intrinsic ADP-ribose hydrolase activityThese results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt. Thus, TRPM2 may play a key role in degranulation by modulating intracellular Ca(2+) in MMCs."

INTERPRETATION: The combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab appeared active, with a good safety profile in patients with mesothelioma, warranting further exploration.Biological and clinical considerations rule out the use of tremelimumab as single agent for MM and, more generally, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for MM is still largely questionable and not supported by evidences.At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7\u00b77 months (95% CI 6\u00b78-8\u00b79) in the tremelimumab group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b77) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b741).

Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins."

Many tools have been developed to analyze genomic variation ranging from single nucleotide variants to whole chromosomal aberrations. As sequencing throughput increases, the number of variants called by such tools also grows. Often employed manual inspection of such calls is thus becoming a time-consuming procedure. We developed the Variant InsPector and Expert Rating tool (VIPER) to speed up this process by integrating the Integrative Genomics Viewer into a web application. Analysts can then quickly iterate through variants, apply filters and make decisions based on the generated images and variant metadata. VIPER was successfully employed in analyses with manual inspection of more than 10 000 calls.Availability and implementation: VIPER is implemented in Java and Javascript and is freely available at https://github.com/MarWoes/viper.Variant Review with the Integrative Genomics Viewer.VIPER: a web application for rapid expert review of variant calls.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.We developed the Variant InsPector and Expert Rating tool (VIPER) to speed up this process by integrating the Integrative Genomics Viewer into a web application."

In vitro studies have suggested that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing but the scope and underlying mechanisms are also unknown. Meta-analysis of published data indicates that mouse Adar3 expression is highest in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and olfactory region. Consistent with this, we show that mice lacking exon 3 of Adar3 (which encodes two double stranded RNA binding domains) have increased levels of anxiety and deficits in hippocampus-dependent short- and long-term memory formation. RNA sequencing revealed a dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic function in the hippocampi of Adar3-deficient mice. We also show that ADAR3 transiently translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon KCl-mediated activation in SH-SY5Y cells. These results indicate that ADAR3 contributes to cognitive processes in mammals.Adar3 Is Involved in Learning and Memory in Mice.-deficient mice. "

Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. "

Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.

In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast.Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.

This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.CONCLUSIONS\nBased on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant?Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.

Of the sample, 20 percent met criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 30 percent met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and 50 percent had clinically significant level of suicidal ideation.Previous studies reported a high prevalence of depression among patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggested a relationship between ASD and suicidalityPatients with ASD had an increased risk of suicide attempts compared with those without ASD."

Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions.MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles.Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools.OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences."

Using the determined X-ray crystal structure of PIM1 complexed to the compound 1-R as a control, we discuss the importance of including the protein flexibility inherent in the ensemble docking protocol, for the accuracy of the structure prediction of the bound state. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Pim1 in complex with a newly developed pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine-derivative inhibitor (SKI-O-068)."

Our objective was to investigate the prognostic value of TAMs in gliomas using automated quantitative double immunofluorescence.This is the first study to use automated quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the prognostic impact of TAMs. Our results suggest that M2-like TAMs hold an unfavourable prognostic value in high-grade gliomas and may contribute to a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment.Our data revealed that the amount of especially CD204+ TAMs increases with malignancy grade. In grade III-IV, high CD204 expression was associated with shorter survival, while high IBA-1 intensity correlated with a longer survival. In grade IV, CD204 showed independent prognostic value when adjusting for clinical data and the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase."
