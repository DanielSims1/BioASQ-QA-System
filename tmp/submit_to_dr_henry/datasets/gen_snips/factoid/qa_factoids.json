Pannexins are a three-member family of vertebrate plasma membrane spanning molecules that have homology to the invertebrate gap junction forming proteins, the innexins. However, pannexins do not form gap junctions but operate as plasma membrane channels. The best-characterized member of these proteins, Pannexin1 (Panx1) was suggested to be functionally associated with purinergic P2X and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. Activation of these receptor channels by their endogenous ligands leads to cross-activation of Panx1 channels. This in turn potentiates P2X and NMDA receptor channel signaling. Two potentiation concepts have been suggested: enhancement of the current responses and/or sustained receptor channel activation by ATP released through Panx1 pore and adenosine generated by ectonucleotidase-dependent dephosphorylation of ATP. Here we summarize the current knowledge and hypotheses about interactions of Panx1 channels with P2X and NMDA receptor channels.

Ewing's sarcoma is an extremely rare mesenchymal malignancy of the bone, which predominantly occurs in children and young adolescents. Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by chromosomal translocations resulting in the formation of chimeric fusions between the EWS gene and transcription factors of the ETS family, such as EWS-FLI-1. The clinical outcome of Ewing's sarcoma remains poor, and novel therapeutic approaches are required. Proteomic analyses have been applied to identify the functions of the fusion gene product, and a novel mechanism of EWS-FLI-1 turnover has been proposed. Furthermore, proteomics has revealed the regulation of IL-6 secretion by EWS-FLI-1, which may promote malignant behavior in tumor cells. In addition, proteomic approaches have been used to assess the effects of unique genes and drugs on Ewing's sarcoma and to determine specific biomarker candidates for the prediction of drug resistance and recurrence. By identifying the proteins relevant to the molecular backgrounds of clinical characters of Ewing's sarcoma, we can understand the biology of Ewing's sarcoma and develop clinical applications. Fundamental research systems such as tumor cell and tissue biobanks and databases are required to make effective use of the limited clinical materials and promote research into Ewing's sarcoma."

The SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflC/K) superfamily is composed of scaffold proteins that form ring-like structures and locally specify the protein-lipid composition in a variety of cellular membranes. Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2) is a member of this superfamily that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) where it acts as a membrane organizer. Here, we report that SLP2 anchors a large protease complex composed of the rhomboid protease PARL and the i-AAA protease YME1L, which we term the SPY complex (for SLP2-PARL-YME1L). Association with SLP2 in the SPY complex regulates PARL-mediated processing of PTEN-induced kinase PINK1 and the phosphatase PGAM5 in mitochondria. Moreover, SLP2 inhibits the stress-activated peptidase OMA1, which can bind to SLP2 and cleaves PGAM5 in depolarized mitochondria. SLP2 restricts OMA1-mediated processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 allowing stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion under starvation conditions. Together, our results reveal an important role of SLP2 membrane scaffolds for the spatial organization of IM proteases regulating mitochondrial dynamics, quality control, and cell survival."

Phenotypes of gangliosidoses range from infantile, late-infantile, juvenile, and to the adult form. The genotype-phenotype correlation is essential for prognosis and clinical care planning for patients with a gangliosidosis condition. Previously, we have developed a method to establish the genotype-phenotype correlation of another lysosomal disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, with in silico tools. This same method was applied to analyze the genotype and phenotype of 38 patients diagnosed with a gangliosidosis disease in the United States. Out of 40 mutations identified, 3 were novel, including p.Tyr192His and p.Phe556Ser of the "

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized with progressive muscle atrophy. We have attempted to establish the link between angiogenesis and cellular survival in the pathogenesis of ALS by compiling evidence described in various scientific reports. The phenotypes of human ALS have earlier been captured in the mutant SOD1 mice as well as by targeted deletion of the hypoxia response element (HRE) from the promoter of the mouse gene for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Indirect evidence shows that angiogenesis can help prevent oxidative stress, and hence, enhance cell survival. VEGF and angiogenin chiefly regulate the process of angiogenesis. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is usually found inside the nucleus, but in large number of cases of ALS, it accumulates in the cytoplasm (TDP-43 proteinopathy). Interestingly, TDP-43 proteinopathy is found to be aggravated in the presence of the OPTN mutation, which is the genetic factor that is responsible for such accumulation. Interaction of TDP-43 with progranulin can further affect the angiogenesis in ALS patients by regulating activity of VEGF receptors, but conclusive evidence is needed to establish its role in pathogenesis of ALS. Certain mutations in UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 indicate that ubiquitination has a role in ALS pathobiology, but its link to angiogenesis has not been adequately studied. Recent studies have shown that several mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can also cause ALS. Conclusively, in this review, we have attempted to argue the role of angiogenesis in enhanced ALS survival rate is probably regulated with the activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2. Additionally, interaction between OPTN and TDP-43 can also impact the transcription of various angiogenic molecules. Whether targeting angiogenic substances or TDP-43 can provide clues about extending ALS survival rate, in combination with current treatments, can only be evaluated after additional studies."

Nystagmus and/or postural tremor and/or learning disabilities were noticed in individuals harboring FGF14 mutation with or without episodic ataxia. These cases and literature data delineate the FGF14-mutation-related episodic ataxia phenotype: wide range of age at onset (from childhood to adulthood), variable durations and frequencies, triggering factors including fever, and association to chronic symptoms.

We isolated three strains of the causative rickettsiae, designated Katayama, Misaka, and Abe, from patients with the disease and studied the characteristics of the isolates. Nude mice and cyclophosphamide-treated mice died after infection with the isolates. However, infected normal mice recovered and acquired immunity. Infected adult male guinea pigs had fever, a scrotal reaction, and seroconversion. The isolates propagated well in tissue-cultured Vero cells. Analysis by the cross-immunofluorescence antibody method showed that these isolates were closely related serologically. To reveal their immunological properties in detail, we produced 21 anti-Katayama monoclonal antibodies. Seven of these antibodies reacted with all representative strains of spotted fever group rickettsiae used in this study, and five others reacted only with the homologous strain, revealing that the Katayama strain has a strain-specific antigen(s) different from those of other spotted fever group rickettsiae. Moreover, these strain-specific antibodies also reacted with the Misaka and Abe strains. These results demonstrate that the causative agent of spotted fever group rickettsiosis in Japan is a new serotype of spotted fever group rickettsiae."

Here, we show that these processes are blocked by mutations in the evolutionarily conserved AAA-ATPase molecular chaperone, CDC48A, homologous to yeast Cdc48 and human p97 proteins, both of which are implicated in ubiquitin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted protein degradation. We demonstrate that CDC48A physically associates with its heterodimeric cofactor UFD1-NPL4, known to bind ubiquitin and SUMO, as well as with SUMO1-modified CenH3 and mutations in NPL4 phenocopy cdc48a mutations. In WT vegetative cell nuclei, genetically unlinked ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci are uniquely clustered together within the nucleolus and all major rRNA gene variants, including those rDNA variants silenced in leaves, are transcribed. In cdc48a mutant vegetative cell nuclei, however, these rDNA loci frequently colocalized with condensed centromeric heterochromatin at the external periphery of the nucleolus. Our results indicate that the CDC48A(NPL4) complex actively removes sumoylated CenH3 from centromeres and disrupts centromeric heterochromatin to release bulk rRNA genes into the nucleolus for ribosome production, which fuels single nucleus-driven pollen tube growth and is essential for plant reproduction.

Monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) metabolises monoamines and is implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. A polymorphic repetitive DNA domain, termed the uVNTR (upstream variable number tandem repeat), located at the promoter of the MAOA gene is a risk factor for many of these disorders. MAOA is on the X chromosome suggesting gender could play a role in regulation. We analysed MAOA regulation in the human female cell line, SH-SY5Y, which is polymorphic for the uVNTR. This heterozygosity allowed us to correlate allele-specific gene expression with allele-specific transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks for MAOA. Gene regulation was analysed under basal conditions and in response to the mood stabiliser sodium valproate. Both alleles were transcriptionally active under basal growth conditions; however, the alleles showed distinct transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks at their respective promoters. Exposure of the cells to sodium valproate resulted in differential allelic expression which correlated with allele-specific changes in distinct transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks at the region encompassing the uVNTR. Biochemically our model for MAOA promoter function has implications for gender differences in gene \u00d7 environment responses in which the uVNTR has been implicated as a genetic risk."

New additions have been coupled with efforts to improve existing families, including refinement of domain boundaries, their classification into Pfam clans, as well as their functional annotation. We recently began to collaborate with the RepeatsDB resource to improve the definition of tandem repeat families within Pfam. We carried out a significant comparison to the structural classification database, namely the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) that led to the creation of 825 new families based on their set of uncharacterized families\u00a0(EUFs). Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors' ORCID identifiers. This effectively permits authors to claim credit for their Pfam curation and link them to their ORCID record."

Moreover, adverse drug reactions are higher in paitents with cancer with T2DM compared to cancer patients without T2DM. Cellular mechanisms of hyperglycemia and chemotherapy efficacy may be different depending upon the particular cancer type and the condition of the patient. This review evaluates the effect of DM on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and adverse drug reactions of commonly used anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and adriamycin in both clinical and animal models. A literature search was conducted in scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar including the relevant keywords. The results of the effectiveness of anticancer therapies in patients with DM are, however, inconsistent because DM can negatively impact multiple diverse entities including nerves and vascular structures, insulin-like growth factor 1, the function of the innate immune system, drug pharmacokinetics, the expression levels of hepatic CYP"

Therefore, here we used RNA sequencing data from human, pig and mouse during early embryonic development to detect edited genes that may regulate stem cell pluripotency. We observed that although most of the RNA editing sites are located in intergenic, intron and UTR, a few editing sites are in coding regions and may result in nonsynonymous amino acid changes. Some editing sites are predicted to change the structure of a protein. We also report that HNF1A, TBX3, ACLY, ECI1 and ERDR1 are related to embryonic development and cell division."

Wernicke's encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency and has a range of presenting features, including gait disturbance, altered cognitive state, nystagmus and other eye movement disorders. In the past, Wernicke's encephalopathy was described almost exclusively in the alcohol-dependent population. However, in current times, Wernicke's encephalopathy is also well recognized in many other patient groups, including patients following bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, cancer and pancreatitis. Early recognition of Wernicke's encephalopathy is vital, as prompt treatment can restore cognitive or ocular function and can prevent permanent disability. Unfortunately, Wernicke's encephalopathy is often undiagnosed - presumably because it is relatively uncommon and has a variable clinical presentation. Clinical biochemists have a unique role in advising clinicians about potential nutritional or metabolic causes of unexplained neurological symptoms and to prompt consideration of thiamine deficiency as a potential cause in high-risk patient groups. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy and to highlight some non-traditional causes, such as after bariatric surgery."

Intracellular concentration of imatinib in leukemic cells is thought to affect the clinical efficacy of this drug in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, there is no report that directly indicates the relationship between intracellular concentration and clinical outcome and/or, plasma concentration. In addition, the impacts of genetic variations of drug transporters, which mediate leukocyte concentration of imatinib, are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between intracellular imatinib concentrations in leukocytes, plasma imatinib levels, and genotypes of drug transporters, including ATP binding cassette B1 (ABCB), ABCG2, solute carrier 22A1 (SLC22A1), solute carrier organic anion transporter family members 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and SLCO1B3. The imatinib levels in leukocytes were determined using HPLC in 15 patients with chronic phase CML. No significant correlation between intracellular and plasma concentrations of imatinib was observed. The intracellular concentration was comparable in both patients with or without complete cytogenetic response. The intracellular imatinib concentration was significantly higher in patients with SLCO1B3 334TT than in those with 334TG/GG (p=0.0188). Plasma concentrations were similar in both SLCO1B3 genotypes (p=0.860), thereby resulting in the intracellular to plasma concentration ratio being higher in patients with SLCO1B3 334TT than those with 334 TG/GG (p=0.0502). These results suggested that the SLCO1B3 334T>G polymorphism could have a significant impact on the intracellular concentration of imatinib in leukocytes as a promising biomarker for personalized treatment of CML patients."

Here we show that Drosha cleavage occurs during transcription acting on both independently transcribed and intron-encoded miRNAs. We also show that both 5'-3' and 3'-5' exonucleases associate with the sites where co-transcriptional Drosha cleavage occurs, promoting intron degradation before splicing. We finally demonstrate that miRNAs can also derive from 3' flanking transcripts of Pol II genes. Our results demonstrate that multiple miRNA-containing transcripts are co-transcriptionally cleaved during their synthesis and suggest that exonucleolytic degradation from Drosha cleavage sites in pre-mRNAs may influence the splicing and maturation of numerous mRNAs."

Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a lethal disorder caused by mutations in the LYST gene that involves progressive neurologic dysfunction. Lyst-mutant mice exhibit neurologic phenotypes that are sensitive to genetic background. On the DBA/2J-, but not on the C57BL/6J-background, Lyst-mutant mice exhibit overt tremor phenotypes associated with loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we tested whether assays for ataxia could measure this observed strain-dependency, and if so, establish parameters for empowering phenotype- and candidate-driven approaches to identify genetic modifier(s). A composite phenotypic scoring system distinguished phenotypes in Lyst-mutants and uncovered a previously unrecognized background difference between wild-type C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Accelerating rotarod performance also distinguished phenotypes in Lyst-mutants, but at more advanced ages. These results establish that genetic background, Lyst genotype, and age significantly influence the severity of CHS-associated neurologic deficits. Purkinje cell quantifications likewise distinguished phenotypes of Lyst-mutant mice, as well as background differences between wild-type C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. To aid identification of potential genetic modifier genes causing these effects, we searched public datasets for cerebellar-expressed genes that are differentially expressed and/or contain potentially detrimental genetic variants. From these approaches, Nos1, Prdx2, Cbln3, Gnb1, Pttg1 were confirmed to be differentially expressed and leading candidates."

Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (pol II) is a highly regulated process. Most human genes have multiple poly(A) sites, which define different possible mRNA ends, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that regulate which poly(A) site is used. Poly(A) site selection may be mediated by cleavage factor I (CFIm), which is part of the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) complex. CFIm comprises CFIm25, CFIm59 and CFim68 subunits. It has been documented that the CPA complex also regulates pol II transcription at the start of genes. We therefore investigated whether CFIm, in addition to its role in poly(A) site selection, is involved in the regulation of pol II transcription."

Basal cell carcinoma is driven by the aberrant activation of hedgehog signaling. DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 is frequently overexpressed in human cancer cells and associated with the tumor growth and invasion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 in the growth, migration, and invasion of basal cell carcinoma. The role of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay in basal cell carcinoma cells. The associations between JAK2/STAT3 pathway and DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 were analyzed in basal cell carcinoma cells. Results showed that DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 is overexpressed in basal cell carcinoma cells. DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells. DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 knockdown increased the apoptosis of basal cell carcinoma cells induced by tunicamycin. Results found that DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 knockdown increased JAK2 and STAT3 expression in basal cell carcinoma cells. JAK2 inhibitor decreased STAT3 expression and abolished the inhibitory effects of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 silencing on migration and invasion in basal cell carcinoma cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein 5 is a potential target for inhibiting basal cell carcinoma cells growth, migration, and invasion by downregulating JAK2/STAT3 pathway."

Reactive plots allow fast and intuitive quality control assessment of the samples. In addition, exploration of the phenotypic associations is possible through coloring and principal component analysis. Altogether, the package makes it easy to perform quality assessment of large-scale methylation datasets, such as epigenome-wide association studies or the datasets available through The Cancer Genome Atlas portal. The shinyMethyl package is implemented in R and available via Bioconductor. Its development repository is at https://github.com/jfortin1/shinyMethyl. "

BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the A\u03b2 peptide that forms amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Small molecule inhibitors of BACE1 are being tested in clinical trials for AD, but the safety and efficacy of BACE1 inhibition has yet to be fully explored. Knockout of the Bace1 gene in the germline of mice causes multiple neurological phenotypes, suggesting that BACE1 inhibition could be toxic. However, these phenotypes could be the result of BACE1 deficiency during development rather than due to the lack of BACE1 function in the adult. To address this problem, we generated tamoxifen-inducible conditional BACE1 knockout mice in which the Bace1 gene may be deleted in the whole body of the adult at will. Importantly, the adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice largely lack phenotypes, indicating that many BACE1 functions are not required in the adult organism. However, a germline phenotype was observed after BACE1 knockout in the adult: reduced length and disorganization of the hippocampal mossy fiber infrapyramidal bundle comprised of axons of dentate gyrus granule cells. The infrapyramidal bundle abnormality correlated with reduced proteolytic processing of the neural cell adhesion protein CHL1 that is involved in axonal guidance. We conclude that BACE1 inhibition in the adult mouse brain does not lead to the phenotypes associated with BACE1 deficiency during embryonic and postnatal development. However, adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice also suggest that BACE1 inhibitor drugs may disrupt the organization of an axonal pathway in the hippocampus, an important structure for learning and memory. Here, I review the adult conditional BACE1 knockout results and consider their implications for BACE1 inhibitor clinical trials."

Symptomatic epidural hematoma (SEH) after anterior cervical spine surgery is very rare, but it has disastrous consequences for the patients. Timely diagnosis and evaluation can effectively reduce the sequelae of neurological deficit in SEH. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze a subset of clinical data of SEH after anterior cervical spine surgery, and to investigate the risk factors and treatment experience of this serious complication.Neurological deterioration after anterior cervical spine surgery was detected in six patients. Epidural hematoma was confirmed by emergency cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients included five males and one female, with an average age of 56.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.1 years (range 42-76 years). Three patients had a history of drinking and/or smoking. All of the patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) preoperatively, but without anticoagulant drugs or pre-spinal surgery. The coagulation function was normal in all patients. Except for one patient, who had lower blood pressure (BP) during the operation and higher BP after the operation, the other patients had a normal level of BP during the pre-, intra-, and post-operation periods. The average time was 9.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.7\u200ahours (range, 2-19\u200ahours) from the postoperative period to the initial neurological deficit and 6.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.0\u200ahours (range, 1.8-16.7\u200ahours) from the initial deterioration to evacuation. Five patients underwent emergency evacuation, and one patient underwent conservative treatment. Four patients who underwent evacuation and one patient who received conservative treatment achieved neurological function recovery with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade 2.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.9 (range, 2-4 score) score at the last follow-up. One patient with confirmed arterial epidural hemorrhage during the evaluation showed no neurological function recovery at the last follow-up.Wide exposure of the epidural space and BP level during the perioperative period play an important role in the formation of SEH after anterior cervical spine surgery. Arterial epidural hematoma has serious consequences; therefore, early diagnosis and evaluation play an important role in the recovery from paralysis."

Both the membrane composition and the intra-organellar content of these organelles can be specifically and temporally controlled by imposing gates, much like bouncers controlling entry into night-clubs. In addition, a new level of compartmentalisation has recently emerged as a fundamental principle of cellular organisation, the formation of membrane-less organelles. Many of these structures are dynamic, rapidly condensing or dissolving and are therefore ideally suited to be involved in emergency cellular adaptation to stresses. Remarkably, the same proteins have also the propensity to adopt self-perpetuating assemblies which properties fit the needs to encode cellular memory. Here, we review some of the principles of phase separation and the function of membrane-less organelles focusing particularly on their roles during stress response and cellular memory."

Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1) is a novel gene involved in prostate cancer progression by enhancing prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulation, is one of the most widely altered mechanisms in prostate cancer. This phenomenon frames the basis to study the DNA methylation patterns in the promoter region of MIEN1. Bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrates the MIEN1 promoter contains a short interspersed nuclear Alu element (SINE Alu) repeat sequence. Validation of methylation inhibition on MIEN1 was performed using nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors and resulted in an increase in both MIEN1 RNA and protein in normal cells. MIEN1 mRNA and protein increases upon inhibition of individual DNA methyltransferases using RNA interference technologies. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays, in silico analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a sequence upstream of the transcription start site that has a site for binding of the USF transcription factors. These results suggest the MIEN1 promoter has a SINE Alu region that is hypermethylated in normal cells leading to repression of the gene. In cancer, the hypomethylation of a part of this repeat, in addition to the binding of USF, results in MIEN1 expression."

The onco-suppressor p53 protein plays also an important role in the control of various aspects of health and disease. p53 levels are low in normal cells and elevated under stress conditions. While low levels of p53 promote tumor formation, overactive p53 leads to premature aging and cell death. RNA degradation is a critical level of regulation contributing to the control of gene expression. p53, as an RNA-binding protein, exerts 3'\u2009\u2192\u20095' exoribonuclease activity, mediating degradation of adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (ARE)-containing ssRNAs. The 3'-UTR of p53-mRNA, which is a target of p53 itself, harbors cis-acting AREs. Our results suggest that p53 controls its own expression through murine double-minute 2 (mdm2)-independent \"RNA decay\" function in cytoplasm. We demonstrate that p53 expresses an exoribonuclease activity through the binding to ARE sequences of p53-mRNA via translation-independent and translation-dependent polysome-associated pathways. Antagonistic interplay\u00a0was detected between p53\u00a0levels and execution of its exoribonuclease function mirrored in low p53 levels in normal cells,\u00a0due to the efficient exoribonuclease activity, and in the accumulation of p53 in cells exposed to p53-activating drugs in accordance with the reduced exoribonuclease activity. Apparently, p53, via control of its own mRNA stability and/or translation in cytoplasm, might act as a negative regulator of p53-mRNA levels. The observed connection between exoribonuclease activity and p53 abundance highlights the importance of this function affecting p53 expression, imperative for multiple functions, with implications for the steady-state levels of protein and for the p53 stress response. The modulation in expression of exoribonuclease activity would be translated into the alterations in p53 level. KEY MESSAGES: p53 controls its own expression through mdm2-independent \"RNA decay\" function in cytoplasm. p53 expresses an exoribonuclease activity through the binding to ARE sequences of p53-mRNA. Antagonistic interplay exists between stress-induced p53 and execution of its exoribonuclease function."

Apixaban is rapidly absorbed, with maximum concentration occurring 3-4\u00a0h after oral administration, and has a half-life of approximately 12\u00a0h. Elimination occurs via multiple pathways including metabolism, biliary excretion, and direct intestinal excretion, with approximately 27% of total apixaban clearance occurring via renal excretion.The pharmacokinetics of apixaban are consistent across a broad range of patients, and apixaban has limited clinically relevant interactions with most commonly prescribed medications, allowing for fixed dosages without the need for therapeutic drug monitoring.The pharmacodynamic effect of apixaban is closely correlated with apixaban plasma concentration.This review provides a summary of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, biopharmaceutical, and drug-drug interaction profiles of apixaban.Additionally, the population-pharmacokinetic analyses of apixaban in both healthy subjects and in the target patient populations are discussed."

Vaspin, visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor, is involved in the development of obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation and energy metabolism.Our previous study showed vaspin expression and its regulation in the ovary; however, the role of this adipokine in ovarian cells has never been studied.Here, we studied in vitro the effect of vaspin on various kinase signaling pathways: mitogen-activated kinase (MAP3/1), serine/threonine kinase (AKT), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein kinase AMP (PRKAA1), protein kinase A (PKA) and on expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB2) as well as on steroid synthesis by porcine ovarian cells.By Western blot, we found that vaspin (1\u00a0ng/ml), in a time-dependent manner, increased phosphorylation of MAP3/1, AKT, STAT3, PRKAA1 and PKA, while it decreased expression of NFKB2.We observed that vaspin, in a dose-dependent manner, increased basal steroid hormones secretion (progesterone and estradiol), mRNA and protein expression of steroid enzymes using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively, and the mRNA of gonadotropins (FSHR, LHCGR) and steroids (PGR, ESR2) receptors.The stimulatory effect of vaspin on basal steroidogenesis was reversed when ovarian cells were cultured in the presence of a PKA pharmacological inhibitor (KT5720) and when GRP78 receptor was knocked down (siRNA).However, in the presence of insulin-like growth factor type 1 and gonadotropins, vaspin reduced steroidogenesis.Thus, vaspin, by activation of various signaling pathways and stimulation of basal steroid production via GRP78 receptor and PKA, could be a new regulator of porcine ovarian function."

The fatty acid-binding proteins play a major role in intracellular transportation of long-chain fatty acids. Nine fatty acid-binding proteins have been identified, with each having individual tissue-specific functions in addition to regulation of fatty acids. This review focuses on the three fatty acid-binding proteins found in the gastrointestinal tract and discusses their role as diagnostic or disease monitoring markers in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Of these three fatty acid-binding proteins, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein is of the most interest due to its exclusive expression in the gastrointestinal tract. The elevation of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in blood and urine reflects enterocyte damage, regardless of the underlying cause. The short half-life of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein also means it is a relatively sensitive marker. In contrast, there is currently less evidence to support liver fatty acid-binding protein and ileal bile acid-binding protein as sensitive biomarkers in these conditions. More extensive studies with specific endpoints are required to validate the roles of these fatty acid-binding proteins in gastrointestinal diseases."

In this study, we combined Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and environmental data to examine the adaptive genetic variations in S. scardica natural populations sampled in contrasting environments. A total of 226 AFLP loci were genotyped in 166 individuals from nine populations. The results demonstrated low gene diversity, ranging from 0.095 to 0.133 and significant genetic differentiation ranging from 0.115 to 0.408. Seven genetic clusters were revealed by Bayesian clustering methods as well as by Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components and each population formed its respective cluster. The exception were populations P02 Mt. Shara and P07 Mt. Vermio, that were admixed between two clusters. Both landscape genetic methods Mcheza and BayeScan identified a total of seven (3.10%) markers exhibiting higher levels of genetic differentiation among populations. The spatial analysis method Sam\u03b2ada detected 50 individual markers (22.12%) associated with bioclimatic variables, among them seven were identified by both Mcheza and BayeScan as being under directional selection. Four bioclimatic variables associated with five out of seven outliers were related to precipitation, suggesting that this variable is the key factor affecting the adaptive variation of S. scardica."

We also carried out an in-situ hybridization study and Northern blot analysis of YB2/RYB-a and protamine 2 mRNA expression. Both YB2/RYB-a mRNA and the proteins appeared in prepubertal mouse testes, prior to the expression of the mouse protamine 2 mRNA. The mRNA and protein were present at high levels in spermatocytes, decreased in round to elongated spermatids, and were absent in spermatozoa. Since the protamine 2 mRNA was present at high levels in round and elongating spermatids, the proposed function of the YB2/RYB-a protein as a translational repressor of the mRNA was supported in mouse. The level and localization of YB2/RYB-a mRNA and protein expression in the rat testis was comparable to that in mouse testis, although rat testis is known to express a very low level of protamine 2, but is also likely to affect the expression of other proteins (including protamine 1) during spermatogenesis."

Concurrently, drug companies in emerging markets have flourished under a different economic model characterized by public-private partnerships, government subsidy, and profitable marketing of generic drugs. These companies are now focusing on research and development of innovative drug candidates, including drugs that treat neglected diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis.
