Choi and Benzer identified Drosophila Nmo in 1994, and Brott et al identified mouse Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) in 1998. Nlk positively regulates the PCP pathway, and negatively regulates the beta-catenin pathway. Here, we identified and characterized rat Nlk gene, Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene by using bioinformatics. Nlk gene, consisting of 11 exons, was mapped to rat chromosome 10q25. Rat Nlk gene encoded 515-aa Nlk protein with the serine/threonine kinase domain, poly(His) tracts and poly(Ala) tract, which showed 100, 99.8, 97.1 and 89.5% total-amino-acid identity with mouse Nlk, human NLK, Xenopus nlk and zebrafish nlk, respectively. Rat Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene were mapped to rat chromosome 13p13 and 2q44, respectively. Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene, consisting of a single exon, were not evolutionarily conserved. Nlk2 gene and Nlkp pseudogene were predicted as retrotransposed Nlk homologs within the rat genome. Nlk2 gene encoded a 480-aa Nlk2 protein with partial deletion within the kinase domain, which was predicted as the dominant negative Nlk homolog. This is the first report on the Nlk gene and retrotransposed Nlk homologs within the rat genome."

JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net) is an open-access database of curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF)-binding profiles stored as position frequency matrices (PFMs) for TFs across multiple species in six taxonomic groups. In this 8th release of JASPAR, the CORE collection has been expanded with 245 new PFMs (169 for vertebrates, 42 for plants, 17 for nematodes, 10 for insects, and 7 for fungi), and 156 PFMs were updated (125 for vertebrates, 28 for plants and 3 for insects). These new profiles represent an 18% expansion compared to the previous release. JASPAR 2020 comes with a novel collection of unvalidated TF-binding profiles for which our curators did not find orthogonal supporting evidence in the literature. This collection has a dedicated web form to engage the community in the curation of unvalidated TF-binding profiles. Moreover, we created a Q&A forum to ease the communication between the user community and JASPAR curators. Finally, we updated the genomic tracks, inference tool, and TF-binding profile similarity clusters. All the data is available through the JASPAR website, its associated RESTful API, and through the JASPAR2020 R/Bioconductor package."

Omic technologies have enabled the complete readout of the molecular state of a cell at different biological scales. In principle, the combination of multiple omic data types can provide an integrated view of the entire biological system. This integration requires appropriate models in a systems biology approach. Here, genome-scale models (GEMs) are focused upon as one computational systems biology approach for interpreting and integrating multi-omic data. GEMs convert the reactions (related to metabolism, transcription, and translation) that occur in an organism to a mathematical formulation that can be modeled using optimization principles. A variety of genome-scale modeling methods used to interpret multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and meta-omics are reviewed. The ability to interpret omics in the context of biological systems has yielded important findings for human health, environmental biotechnology, bioenergy, and metabolic engineering. The authors find that concurrent with advancements in omic technologies, genome-scale modeling methods are also expanding to enable better interpretation of omic data. Therefore, continued synthesis of valuable knowledge, through the integration of omic data with GEMs, are expected."

Almost two decades after the identification of SNCA as the first causative gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the subsequent understanding that genetic factors play a substantial role in PD development, our knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying this disease has vastly improved. Approximately 5-10% of patients suffer from a monogenic form of PD where autosomal dominant mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35 and autosomal recessive mutations in PINK1, DJ-1, and Parkin cause the disease with high penetrance. Furthermore, recent whole-exome sequencing have described autosomal recessive DNAJC6 mutations in predominately atypical, but also cases with typical PD. In addition, several other genes have been linked to atypical Parkinsonian phenotypes. However, the vast majority of PD is genetically complex, i.e. it is caused by the combined action of common genetic variants in concert with environmental factors. By the application of genome-wide association studies, 26 PD risk loci have been established to date. Similar to other genetically complex diseases, these show only moderate effects on PD risk. Increasing this etiologic complexity, many of the involved genetic and environmental risk factors likely interact in an intricate fashion. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge in PD genetics."

All Ras isoforms have long been considered membrane bound, a localization required for function. Our recent study revealed that N-Ras differs from all other isoforms in being largely cytosolic even following modification with a prenyl lipid. Endogenous, cytosolic N-Ras chromatographed in both high and low molecular weight pools, a pattern that required prenylation, suggesting prenyl-dependent interaction with other proteins. VPS35, a coat protein of the retromer, was shown to interact with prenylated N-Ras in the cytosol. Silencing VPS35 results in partial N-Ras mislocalization on vesicular and tubulovesicular structures, reduced GTP-loading of Ras proteins, and inhibited proliferation and MAPK signaling in an oncogenic N-Ras-driven tumor cell line. Our data revealed a novel regulator of N-Ras trafficking and signaling."

Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have revealed millions of somatic mutations associated with different human cancers, and the vast majority of them are located outside of coding sequences, making it challenging to directly interpret their functional effects. With the rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, genome-scale long-range chromatin interactions were detected, and distal target genes of regulatory elements were determined using three-dimensional (3D) chromatin looping. Herein, we present OncoBase (http://www.oncobase.biols.ac.cn/), an integrated database for annotating 81 385 242 somatic mutations in 68 cancer types from more than 120 cancer projects by exploring their roles in distal interactions between target genes and regulatory elements. OncoBase integrates local chromatin signatures, 3D chromatin interactions in different cell types and reconstruction of enhancer-target networks using state-of-the-art algorithms. It employs informative visualization tools to display the integrated local and 3D chromatin signatures and effects of somatic mutations on regulatory elements. Enhancer-promoter interactions estimated from chromatin interactions are integrated into a network diffusion system that quantitatively prioritizes somatic mutations and target genes from a large pool. Thus, OncoBase is a useful resource for the functional annotation of regulatory noncoding regions and systematically benchmarking the regulatory effects of embedded noncoding somatic mutations in human carcinogenesis."

The PARK2 gene is mutated in 50% of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP) cases. It encodes parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the RBR family. Parkin exists in an autoinhibited state that is activated by phosphorylation of its N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and binding of phosphoubiquitin. We describe the 1.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of human parkin in its fully inhibited state and identify the key interfaces to maintain parkin inhibition. We identify the phosphoubiquitin-binding interface, provide a model for the phosphoubiquitin-parkin complex and show how phosphorylation of the Ubl domain primes parkin for optimal phosphoubiquitin binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of phosphoubiquitin leads to displacement of the Ubl domain through loss of structure, unveiling a ubiquitin-binding site used by the E2~Ub conjugate, thus leading to active parkin. We find the role of the Ubl domain is to prevent parkin activity in the absence of the phosphorylation signals, and propose a model for parkin inhibition, optimization for phosphoubiquitin recruitment, release of inhibition by the Ubl domain and engagement with an E2~Ub conjugate. Taken together, this model provides a mechanistic framework for activating parkin."

Computer-aided strategies are useful for reducing the costs and increasing the success-rate in drug discovery. Among these strategies, methods based on pharmacophores (an ensemble of electronic and steric features representing the target active site) are efficient to implement over large compound libraries. However, traditional pharmacophore-based methods require knowledge of active compounds or ligand-receptor structures, and only few ones account for target flexibility. Here, we developed a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol, Flexi-pharma, that overcomes these limitations. The protocol uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore receptor flexibility, and performs a pharmacophore-based virtual screening over a set of MD conformations without requiring prior knowledge about known ligands or ligand-receptor structures for building the pharmacophores. The results from the different receptor conformations are combined using a \"voting\" approach, where a vote is given to each molecule that matches at least one pharmacophore from each MD conformation. Contrarily to other approaches that reduce the pharmacophore ensemble to some representative models and score according to the matching models or molecule conformers, the Flexi-pharma approach takes directly into account the receptor flexibility by scoring in regards to the receptor conformations. We tested the method over twenty systems, finding an enrichment of the dataset for 19 of them. Flexi-pharma is computationally efficient allowing for the screening of thousands of compounds in minutes on a single CPU core. Moreover, the ranking of molecules by vote is a general strategy that can be applied with any pharmacophore-filtering program."

One of the major hurdles in treating tuberculosis (TB) is the time-consuming and difficult methodology for diagnosis. Stable-isotope breath tests hold great potential for rapidly diagnosing an infectious disease, monitoring therapy, and determining a bacterial phenotype in a rapid, point-of-care manner that does not require invasive sampling. Here we describe the preclinical development of a potentially highly selective TB diagnostic breath test based upon the organism's CO dehydrogenase activity. After development of the test in vitro, we were able to use the breath test to discriminate between infected and control rabbits, demonstrating that a diagnosis can potentially be made and also that a complex bacterial phenotype can be noninvasively and rapidly studied in the host. IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major infectious cause of disease and death worldwide, and effective diagnosis and then treatment are the tools with which we fight TB. The more quickly and more specific the diagnosis can be made, the better, and this is also true of diagnosis being as close to the patient (point of care) as possible. Here we report our preclinical development of breath tests based upon specific mycobacterial metabolism that could, with development, allow rapid point-of-care diagnosis through measuring the mycobacterial conversion of labeled CO to labeled CO2."

The loss of function of specific genes caused by genetic alterations in paternal allele causes PWS while the absence in maternal allele results AS. The laboratory diagnosis of PWS and AS is complex and demands molecular biology and cytogenetics techniques to identify the genetic mechanism related to the development of the disease. The DNA methylation analysis in chromosome 15 at the SNURF-SNRPN locus through MS-PCR confirms the diagnosis and distinguishes between PWS and AS. Our study aimed to establish the MS-PCR technique associated with High-Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) in PWS and AS diagnostic with a single pair of primers."

DNA methyltransferases are responsible for catalyzing the methylation of adenine/cytosine residues in specific regions of the genome, and they participate in the establishment of epigenetic modification patterns. Deregulation of DNA methyltransferase activity will disturb DNA methylation systems, leading to the occurrence of various human diseases including cancers. Moreover, DNA methyltransferases may serve as promising therapeutic targets, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have been used for disease treatment. Therefore, the detection of DNA methyltransferases and screening of their inhibitors are crucial for both fundamental biomedical research studies and clinical practice. Due to their excellent size-dependent optical, chemical, electronic, and mechanical features, nanomaterials have been widely used as powerful building materials to construct efficient biosensors for DNA methyltransferase assay with high sensitivity and good selectivity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the development of nanomaterial-based biosensors for DNA methyltransferase assay including the strategies, features and applications, and highlight the future direction and challenges in this area as well."

Recently, a variety of small molecule inhibitors for chymase have been developed with a primary focus on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the expected therapeutic benefit of these chymase inhibitors, they have not been used clinically. Here, we attempted to identify new chymase inhibitors using a multistep structure-based virtual screening protocol combined with our knowledge-based in silico fragment mapping technique. The mapping procedure identified fragments with novel modes of interaction at the oxyanion hole of chymase. Next, we constructed a three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore model and retrieved eight candidate chymase inhibitors from a commercial database that included approximately five million compounds. This selection was achieved using a multistep virtual screening protocol, which combined a 3D pharmacophore-based search, docking calculations, and analyses of binding free energy. One of the eight compounds exhibited concentration-dependent chymase inhibitory activity, which could be further optimized to develop more potent chymase inhibitors."

Although chlorophenol (CP) degradation has been studied, no bacterium responsible for degradation of CP under denitrifying conditions has been isolated. Moreover, little substantial evidence for anaerobic degradation of CPs coupled with denitrification is available even for mixed cultures. Degradation of CP [2-CP, 3-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) or 2,6-DCP] under denitrifying conditions was examined in anaerobic batch culture inoculated with activated sludge. Although 3-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-DCP and 2,6-DCP were not stably degraded, 2-CP was degraded and its degradation capability was sustained in a subculture. However, the rate of 2-CP degradation was not significantly enhanced by subculturing. In 2-CP-degrading cultures, nitrate was consumed stoichiometrically and concomitantly during 2-CP degradation, and a dechlorination intermediate was not detected, suggesting that 2-CP degradation was coupled with nitrate reduction. A 2-CP-degrading enrichment culture degraded 2-CP in the presence of nitrate, but did not in the absence of nitrate or the presence of sulfate. This suggests that the enrichment culture strictly requires nitrate for degradation of 2-CP. The apparent specific growth rate of the 2-CP degrading species was 0.0139 d(-1). Thus the apparent doubling time of the 2-CP-degrading population in the enrichment culture was greater than 50 d, which may explain difficulty in enrichment and isolation of micro-organisms responsible for CP degradation under denitrifying conditions."

The ability to detect short gaps in noise is an important tool for assessing the temporal resolution in the auditory cortex. However, the mere existence of responses to temporal gaps bounded by two short broadband markers is surprising, because of the expected short-term suppression that is prevalent in auditory cortex. Here, we used in-vivo intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats to dissect the synaptic mechanisms that underlie gap-related responses. When a gap is bounded by two short markers, a gap termination response was evoked by the onset of the second marker with minimal contribution from the offset of the first marker. Importantly, we show that the gap termination response was driven by a different (potentially partially overlapping) synaptic population than that underlying the onset response to the first marker. This recruitment of additional synaptic resources is a novel mechanism contributing to the important perceptual task of gap detection."

Over the course of the last 10 years, we have studied the genetic and molecular mechanisms leading to disorders that affect the adrenal cortex, with emphasis on those that are developmental, hereditary and associated with adrenal hypoplasia or hyperplasia, multiple tumors and abnormalities in other endocrine glands. On the basis of this work, we propose an hypothesis on how adrenocortical tumors form and the importance of the cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathway in this process. The regulatory subunit type 1-alpha (RIalpha) of protein kinase A (PKA) (the PRKAR1A gene) is mutated in most patients with Carney complex and primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). Phosphodiesterase-11A (the PDE11A gene) and -8B (the PDE8B gene) mutations were found in patients with isolated adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing syndrome, as well in patients with PPNAD. PKA effects on tumor suppression and/or development and the cell cycle are becoming clear: PKA and/or cAMP act as a coordinator of growth and proliferation in the adrenal cortex. Mouse models in which the respective genes have been knocked out see m to support this notion. Genome-wide searches for other genes responsible for adrenal tumors and related diseases are ongoing; recent evidece of the involvement of the mitochondrial oxidation pathway in adrenocortical tumorigenesis is derived from our study of rare associations such as those of disorders predisposing to adrenomedullary and related tumors (Carney triad, the dyad of paragangliomas and gastric stromal sarcomas or Carney-Stratakis syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome) which appear to be associated with adrenocortical lesions."

Ribosomal proteins have long been known to serve critical roles in facilitating the biogenesis of the ribosome and its ability to synthesize proteins. However, evidence is emerging that suggests ribosomal proteins are also capable of performing tissue-restricted, regulatory functions that impact normal development and pathological conditions, including cancer. The challenge in studying such regulatory functions is that elimination of many ribosomal proteins also disrupts ribosome biogenesis and/or function. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether developmental abnormalities resulting from ablation of a ribosomal protein result from loss of core ribosome functions or from loss of the regulatory function of the ribosomal protein. Rpl22, a ribosomal protein component of the large 60S subunit, provides insight into this conundrum; Rpl22 is dispensable for both ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis yet its ablation causes tissue-restricted disruptions in development. Here we review evidence supporting the regulatory functions of Rpl22 and other ribosomal proteins. "

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells that can activate either in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement or through activating cytokines and play an important role in autoimmune disorders. The study examined the level and function of MAIT cells in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Circulating MAIT cell levels were significantly reduced in IBD patients. This MAIT cell deficiency was correlated with IBD disease activity grades, hemoglobin, and CRP. IFN-\u03b3 production of circulating MAIT cells in response to both MHC class 1b-like related protein (MR1)-dependent and -independent stimulations was decreased in IBD patients, which was partially associated with reduced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1) transcription factor, a main regulator of IFN-\u03b3 production. Expression levels of CD69, programmed death-1 (PD-1), and annexin V in MAIT cells were elevated in IBD patients. CCL20, CXCL10, CXCL16, and CCL25 were expressed higher in inflamed intestinal tissues than in noninflamed tissues. This study demonstrates that circulating MAIT cells are activated and numerically and functionally deficient in IBD patients. Furthermore, activated MAIT cells have the potential to migrate to inflamed tissues. These findings suggest an important role of MAIT cells in mucosal immunity in IBD."

When levonorgestrel (LNG) is given for emergency contraception during the follicular phase, it not only inhibits or delays ovulation, but also induces changes in endometrial secretions that modulate sperm functionality. In order to characterize the female reproductive tract secreted molecules that may affect human spermatozoa, we analyzed changes in the protein content of uterine flushings obtained from women during the periovulatory phase of a control and a LNG-treated menstrual cycle. Lectin affinity analysis and 2D gel electrophoresis of uterine samples showed changes in protein glycosylation patterns and the presence of 31 differentially expressed proteins (8 upregulated and 23 downregulated). Mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses of the differential expressed proteins showed lactotransferrin (LTF) as one of the upregulated molecules by LNG. In this study, LTF exhibited significant dose-related effects on sperm functionality, particularly a decrease of calcium ionophore-induced acrosome reaction and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Overall, the results indicated that LNG promoted changes in the proteome of uterine secretions that might compromise human sperm capacitation. These data further support the participation of other mechanisms of action of LNG as emergency contraceptive, in addition to those on ovulation."
