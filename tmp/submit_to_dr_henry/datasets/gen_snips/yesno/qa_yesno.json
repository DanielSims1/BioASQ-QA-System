Fluoroquinolones substituted with N-1 biphenyl and napthyl groups were discovered to act as catalytically inhibitors of human topoisomerases I and II, and to possess anti-proliferative activity in\u00a0vivo. Structural requirements for these novel quinolones to inhibit catalytic activity of human topoisomerase I have not been explored. In this work novel derivatives of the N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone were designed, synthesized and evaluated to understand structural requirements of the C-3 carboxylic acid, C-6 fluorine, C-7 aminomethylpyrrolidine, C-8 methoxy, and the N-1 biphenyl functional groups for hTopoI inhibition. Characterization of each analog for inhibition of hTopoI catalytic inhibition reveals critical insight into structural requirements of these novel quinolones for activity. Additionally, results of DNA binding and modeling studies suggest that N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolones intercalate between the DNA base pairs with the N-1 biphenyl functional group, rather than the quinolone core, and that this mode of DNA intercalation contributes to inhibition of hTopoI by these novel structures. The results presented here support further development and evaluation of N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone analogs as a novel class of anti-cancer agents that act through catalytic inhibition of hTopoI."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can participate in a variety of CVDs through post-transcriptional regulation of target gene proteins. Among them, microRNA-30 (miR-30) is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the heart. In recent years, the study found that the miR-30 family can participate in VR through a variety of mechanisms, including autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. VR is commonly found in ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), antineoplastic drug cardiotoxicity (CTX), and other CVDs.

The Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) gene SMN was recently duplicated (SMN1 and SMN2) in higher primates. Furthermore, invasion of the locus by repetitive elements almost doubled its size with respect to mouse Smn, in spite of an almost identical protein-coding sequence. Herein, we found that SMN ranks among the human genes with highest density of Alus, which are evolutionary conserved in primates and often occur in inverted orientation. Inverted repeat Alus (IRAlus) negatively regulate splicing of long introns within SMN, while promoting widespread alternative circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of ultra-conserved Sam68 binding sites in SMN IRAlus. Cross-link-immunoprecipitation (CLIP), mutagenesis and silencing experiments showed that Sam68 binds in proximity of intronic Alus in the SMN pre-mRNA, thus favouring circRNA biogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlight a novel layer of regulation in SMN expression, uncover the crucial impact exerted by IRAlus and reveal a role for Sam68 in SMN circRNA biogenesis."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can participate in a variety of CVDs through post-transcriptional regulation of target gene proteins. Among them, microRNA-30 (miR-30) is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the heart. In recent years, the study found that the miR-30 family can participate in VR through a variety of mechanisms, including autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. VR is commonly found in ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), antineoplastic drug cardiotoxicity (CTX), and other CVDs. Therefore, we will review the relevant mechanisms of the miR-30 in VR induced by various diseases."

Metabolism has been shown to control peripheral immunity, but little is known about its role in central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Through a combination of proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and perturbation studies, we found that sphingolipid metabolism in astrocytes triggers the interaction of the C2 domain in cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) with the CARD domain in mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), boosting NF-\u03baB-driven transcriptional programs that promote CNS inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. cPLA2 recruitment to MAVS also disrupts MAVS-hexokinase 2 (HK2) interactions, decreasing HK enzymatic activity and the production of lactate involved in the metabolic support of neurons. Miglustat, a drug used to treat Gaucher and Niemann-Pick disease, suppresses astrocyte pathogenic activities and ameliorates EAE. Collectively, these findings define a novel immunometabolic mechanism that drives pro-inflammatory astrocyte activities, outlines a new role for MAVS in CNS inflammation, and identifies candidate targets for therapeutic intervention."

Ubiquitin and some of its homologues target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Other ubiquitin-like domains are involved in cellular processes unrelated to the proteasome, and proteins containing these domains remain stable in the cell. We find that the 10 yeast ubiquitin-like domains tested bind to the proteasome, and that all 11 identified domains can target proteins for degradation. Their apparent proteasome affinities are not directly related to their stabilities or functions. That is, ubiquitin-like domains in proteins not part of the ubiquitin proteasome system may bind the proteasome more tightly than domains in proteins that are bona fide components. We propose that proteins with ubiquitin-like domains have properties other than proteasome binding that confer stability. We show that one of these properties is the absence of accessible disordered regions that allow the proteasome to initiate degradation. In support of this model, we find that Mdy2 is degraded in yeast when a disordered region in the protein becomes exposed and that the attachment of a disordered region to Ubp6 leads to its degradation."

                    "context": "Guidelines in the management of diabetic nerve pain: clinical utility of pregabalin. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin."

We validated the prognostic value of candidate microRNA signatures and contextualized them in relevant transcriptomic and epigenomic networks.

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the conserved multifunctional transcription factor CTCF was previously identified as important to maintain CTCF insulator and chromatin barrier functions. However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and also the necessity of this modification for other CTCF functions remain unknown. In this study, we identified potential sites of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation within the N-terminal domain of CTCF and generated a mutant deficient in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Using this CTCF mutant, we demonstrated the requirement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation for optimal CTCF function in transcriptional activation of the p19ARF promoter and inhibition of cell proliferation. By using a newly generated isogenic insulator reporter cell line, the CTCF insulator function at the mouse Igf2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) was found to be compromised by the CTCF mutation. The association and simultaneous presence of PARP-1 and CTCF at the ICR, confirmed by single and serial chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, were found to be independent of CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. These results suggest a model of CTCF regulation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation whereby CTCF and PARP-1 form functional complexes at sites along the DNA, producing a dynamic reversible modification of CTCF. By using bioinformatics tools, numerous sites of CTCF and PARP-1 colocalization were demonstrated, suggesting that such regulation of CTCF may take place at the genome level."

Transcriptome-wide examination of RNA isoforms and their abundance and translation in HuR-deficient B cells, together with direct measurements of HuR-RNA interactions, revealed that HuR-dependent splicing of mRNA affected hundreds of transcripts, including that encoding dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (Dlst), a subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-KGDH) complex. In the absence of HuR, defective mitochondrial metabolism resulted in large amounts of reactive oxygen species and B cell death.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag and the cellular protein cyclophilin A form an essential complex in the virion core: virions produced by proviruses encoding Gag mutants with decreased cyclophilin A affinity exhibit attenuated infectivity, as do virions produced in the presence of the competitive inhibitor cyclosporine. The A224E Gag mutant has no effect on cyclophilin A affinity but renders HIV-1 replication cyclosporine resistant in Jurkat T cells. In contrast, A224E mutant virus is dead in H9 T cells, although replication is rescued by cyclosporine or by expression in cis of a Gag mutant that decreases cyclophilin A-affinity. The observation that disruption of the Gag-cyclophilin A interaction rescues A224E mutant replication in H9 cells prompted experiments which revealed that, relative to Jurkat cells, H9 cells express greater quantities of cyclophilin A. The resulting larger quantity of cyclophilin A shown to be packaged into virions produced by H9 cells is presumably disruptive to the A224E mutant virion core. Further evidence that increased cyclophilin A expression in H9 cells is of functional relevance was provided by the finding that Gag mutants with decreased cyclophilin A affinity are dead in Jurkat cells but capable of replication in H9 cells. Similarly, cyclosporine concentrations which inhibit wild-type HIV-1 replication in Jurkat cells stimulate HIV-1 replication in H9 cells. These results suggest that HIV-1 virion infectivity imposes narrow constraints upon cyclophilin A stoichiometry in virions and that infectivity is finely tuned by host cyclophilin A expression levels."

                    "context": "Rabbit erythrocytes possess adenylyl cyclase type II that is activated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs and Gi. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from rabbit erythrocytes occurs in response to deformation or reduced oxygen tension. A signal transduction pathway that relates these stimuli to ATP release has been proposed. This pathway includes the heterotrimeric G proteins, Gs and Gi, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Importantly, adenylyl cyclase types II, IV and VII have been reported to be activated by both Gs and Gi. Here, we demonstrate that rabbit erythrocytes possess an adenylyl cyclase subtype that is activated both by the alpha subunit and the betagamma subunit of Gs and Gi, respectively. Washed rabbit erythrocytes released ATP when exposed to the beta adrenergic receptor-mediated activator of Gs, isoproterenol (ISO, 10 microM, n = 8, p < 0.05) as well as in response to incubation with a direct activator of Gi, mastoparan 7 (MAS7, 10 microM, n = 12, p < 0.05). In contrast, an inactive mastoparan derivative, mastoparan 17 (MAS 17, 10 microM, n = 6) did not stimulate ATP release. Importantly, incubation of washed rabbit erythrocytes with either isoprotenerol (ISO) (10 microM, n = 7) or MAS7 (10 microM, n = 11) resulted in increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (p < 0.01).Western analysis was used to determine if an adenylyl cyclase capable of being activated by both Gs and Gi was a component of rabbit erythrocyte membranes. We identified adenylyl cyclase type II with two antibodies generated against different epitopes of the protein. These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in rabbit erythrocytes, activation of either Gs or Gi results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase resulting in increases in cAMP leading, ultimately, to the release of ATP."

The inborn errors of heme biosynthesis, the Porphyrias, include eight major disorders resulting from loss-of-function (LOF) or gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in eight of the nine heme biosynthetic genes. The major sites of heme biosynthesis are the liver and erythron, and the underlying pathophysiology of each of these disorders depends on the unique biochemistry, cell biology, and genetic mechanisms in these tissues. The porphyrias are classified into three major categories: 1) the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs), including Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), Hereditary Coproporphyria (HCP), Variegate Porphyria (VP), and 5-Aminolevlulinic Acid Dehydratase Deficient Porphyria (ADP); 2) a hepatic cutaneous porphyria, Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT); and 3) the cutaneous erythropoietic porphyrias, Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP), Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP), and X-Linked Protoporphyria (XLP). Their modes of inheritance include autosomal dominant with markedly decreased penetrance (AIP, VP, and HCP), autosomal recessive (ADP, CEP, and EPP), or X-linked (XLP), as well as an acquired sporadic form (PCT). There are severe homozygous dominant forms of the three AHPs. For each porphyria, its phenotype, inheritance pattern, unique genetic principles, and molecular genetic heterogeneity are presented. To date, >1000 mutations in the heme biosynthetic genes causing their respective porphyrias have been reported, including low expression alleles and genotype/phenotype correlations that predict severity for certain porphyrias. The tissue-specific regulation of heme biosynthesis and the unique genetic mechanisms for each porphyria are highlighted."

The heterothallic ascomycete Fusarium fujikuroi is a notorious rice pathogen causing super-elongation of plants due to the production of terpene-derived gibberellic acids (GAs) that function as natural plant hormones. Additionally, F. fujikuroi is able to produce a variety of polyketide- and non-ribosomal peptide-derived metabolites such as bikaverins, fusarubins and fusarins as well as metabolites from yet unidentified biosynthetic pathways, e.g. moniliformin. The key enzymes needed for their production belong to the family of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) that are generally known to be post-translationally modified by a Sfp-type 4'phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). In this study we provide evidence that the F. fujikuroi Sfp-type PPTase FfPpt1 is essentially involved in lysine biosynthesis and production of bikaverins, fusarubins and fusarins, but not moniliformin as shown by analytical methods. Concomitantly, targeted Ffppt1 deletion mutants reveal an enhancement of terpene-derived metabolites like GAs and volatile substances such as \u03b1-acorenol. Pathogenicity assays on rice roots using fluorescent labeled wild-type and Ffppt1 mutant strains indicate that lysine biosynthesis and iron acquisition but not PKS and NRPS metabolism is essential for establishment of primary infections of F. fujikuroi. Additionally, FfPpt1 is involved in conidiation and sexual mating recognition possibly by activating PKS- and/or NRPS-derived metabolites that could act as diffusible signals. Furthermore, the effect on iron acquisition of Ffppt1 mutants led us to identify a previously uncharacterized putative third reductive iron uptake system (FfFtr3/FfFet3) that is closely related to the FtrA/FetC system of A. fumigatus. Functional characterization provides evidence that both proteins are involved in iron acquisition and are liable to transcriptional repression of the homolog of the Aspergillus GATA-type transcription factor SreA under iron-replete conditions. Targeted deletion of the first Fusarium homolog of this GATA-type transcription factor-encoding gene, Ffsre1, strongly indicates its involvement in regulation of iron homeostasis and oxidative stress resistance."

Unknown liver lesions represent a common clinical challenge, for example in the context of routine ultrasound examinations of primary care physicians. There are different data on the prevalence of primary liver lesions in the literature. As such, a forensic autopsy series described focal liver lesions in about 50\u200a% of all examined men between 35 and 69 years of age with an increasing incidence for older people. In the diagnostic work-up of unclear liver lesions, a careful distinction between lesions that occur in asymptomatic and healthy individuals and are benign in over 95\u200a% of cases, and lesion found in patients with pre-existing malignant, inflammatory or cirrhotic disease must be made. The main goal in the diagnosis of unclear liver lesions is to prove the benignity of the lesion and to exclude a malignant cause as reliably as possible. In case of benign lesions, an attempt should be made to achieve an exact classification. The most common benign focal liver lesions include liver cysts, focal fatty liver deposition or sparing, haemangiomas, focal calcifications, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), nodular regenerative hyperplasia, biliary hamartomas (von-Meyenburg complexes) and hepatocellular adenomas. Abscesses, inflammatory infiltrations or pseudotumors as well as sites of extramedullary haematopoiesis are observed much less frequently. Among the most frequent malignant focal liver lesions are metastases of other tumor entities such as colorectal cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA).

To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here, we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programmes within them. "

Secretory granules have been observed to swell during the process of exocytosis. Swelling is an indication of osmotic stress. The probable role of osmotic pressure in facilitating membrane fusion makes it necessary to determine whether granule membrane 'swelling' can occur prior to its fusion with the plasma membrane (pore formation) in the process of exocytosis. By subjecting adjacent thin and semi-thin sections of an activated granule to ultrastructural examination for membrane enlargement, and to metachromatic staining for verification of pore formation it is concluded that the perigranular membrane can indeed enlarge prior to pore formation. However, the degree of membrane enlargement can far exceed the limit of 2-3% stretching allowed under normal osmotic stress for a membrane bilayer. Such an extensive membrane enlargement, which takes place in the mechanism of exocytosis, cannot be achieved without being accompanied by the insertion of additional membrane."

Mendelian randomization (MR) implemented through instrumental variables analysis is an increasingly popular causal inference tool used in genetic epidemiology. But it can have limitations for evaluating simultaneous causal relationships in complex data sets that include, for example, multiple genetic predictors and multiple potential risk factors associated with the same genetic variant. Here we use real and simulated data to investigate Bayesian network analysis (BN) with the incorporation of directed arcs, representing genetic anchors, as an alternative approach. A Bayesian network describes the conditional dependencies/independencies of variables using a graphical model (a directed acyclic graph) with an accompanying joint probability. In real data, we found BN could be used to infer simultaneous causal relationships that confirmed the individual causal relationships suggested by bi-directional MR, while allowing for the existence of potential horizontal pleiotropy (that would violate MR assumptions). In simulated data, BN with two directional anchors (mimicking genetic instruments) had greater power for a fixed type 1 error than bi-directional MR, while BN with a single directional anchor performed better than or as well as bi-directional MR. Both BN and MR could be adversely affected by violations of their underlying assumptions (such as genetic confounding due to unmeasured horizontal pleiotropy). BN with no directional anchor generated inference that was no better than by chance, emphasizing the importance of directional anchors in BN (as in MR). Under highly pleiotropic simulated scenarios, BN outperformed both MR (and its recent extensions) and two recently-proposed alternative approaches: a multi-SNP mediation intersection-union test (SMUT) and a latent causal variable (LCV) test. We conclude that BN incorporating genetic anchors is a useful complementary method to conventional MR for exploring causal relationships in complex data sets such as those generated from modern \"omics\" technologies."

Nuclear architecture plays a significant role in DNA repair mechanisms. It is evident that proteins involved in DNA repair are compartmentalized in not only spontaneously occurring DNA lesions or ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), but a specific clustering of these proteins can also be observed within the whole cell nucleus. For example, 53BP1-positive and BRCA1-positive DNA repair foci decorate chromocenters and can appear close to nuclear speckles. Both 53BP1 and BRCA1 are well-described factors that play an essential role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. These proteins are members of two protein complexes: 53BP1-RIF1-PTIP and BRCA1-CtIP, which make a \"decision\" determining whether canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) is activated. It is generally accepted that 53BP1 mediates the NHEJ mechanism, while HDR is activated via a BRCA1-dependent signaling pathway. Interestingly, the 53BP1 protein appears relatively quickly at DSB sites, while BRCA1 is functional at later stages of DNA repair, as soon as the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is recruited to the DNA lesions. A function of the 53BP1 protein is also linked to a specific histone signature, including phosphorylation of histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) or methylation of histone H4 at the lysine 20 position (H4K20me); therefore, we also discuss an epigenetic landscape of 53BP1-positive DNA lesions."

Formalin fixation is considered an important process for preservation of human tissue samples for long periods. However, this process not only results in cross-linking complicating isolation of nucleic acid but also introduces polymerase \"blocks\" during polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At present, many protocols have already been developed aiming at extracting high amounts of amplifiable DNA from formalin-fixed tissues (FFTs). However, there are few methods for repairing formalin-damaged DNA. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of several post-extraction enzymatic repair techniques, including Taq DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase, the PreCR\u2122 Repair Mix and Restorase\u00ae DNA Polymerase, in restoring STR profiles from formalin-damaged DNA. Our results indicated that formalin-damaged DNA may be repaired partly with Taq DNA polymerase and the Restorase\u00ae DNA Polymerase, and lost alleles may be restored and STR peak heights may increase upon repair with them. Moreover, the repair ability of the protocol 2 with Taq DNA polymerase surpasses the Restorase\u00ae DNA Polymerase."

An infertility problem is a complex issue that affects 15% approximately of couples worldwide. The current study was designed to evaluate if there is a variation in the status of global DNA methylation among the study groups and to assess their impact on the protamine expression level and human semen parameters. Totalling 200 semen samples were collected from men (50 proved fertile, 60 normospermia and 90 oligospermia) with an average age of 34.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0years. The DNA and RNA were isolated from purified spermatozoa; then, ELISA and qPCR were applied to estimate the status of global sperm DNA methylation and protamine expression level respectively. Besides that, the sperm chromatin decondensation and sperm DNA fragmentation were assessed. A significant variation was found in the global sperm DNA methylation and the protamine 1 and protamine 2 expression level among the study groups (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.001). Down-regulation has been found in the protamine 1 and protamine 2 expression levels in the oligospermia group compared to the proved fertile group with fold change (0.001 and 0.0002 respectively). In conclusion, this study proposes that the alteration in global DNA methylation may influence the protamine expression level and may be lead to abnormalities in human semen parameters."

A synthetic pathway for the directed preparation of three novel polyoxovanadate-based copper frameworks (POVCFs), i.e., [Cu0.5(1-ipIM)2]2[V4O11] (POVCF 1), [Cu(1-ipIM)2](VO3)2 (POVCF 2) and [Cu(1-pIM)4](HpIM)4[V10O28] (POVCF 3) (1-ipIM = 1-isopropylimidazole; 1-pIM = 1-propylimidazole) using bifunctional imidazole molecules as organic ligands and base has been developed. Systematic studies revealed that the variable base enviroment in the reaction is the key step in the preparation of 1D to 3D supermolecular networks of POVCFs 1-3. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated that the Cu2+ atoms of POVCFs 1-2 were coordinated with four imidazole derivative molecules and two different polyoxovanadate {[V4O11]2- and [V10O28]6-} clusters, respectively, exhibiting a [CuN4O2] binding set and a distorted octahedral geometry. Specifically, POVCF 1 exhibited adjacent [V4O11]2- that dangle up and down arranged in a parallel 2D network and further coordinated with [Cu(1-ipIM)4]2+ to form a 3D supramolecular structure. However, POVCF 3 presented one tetrahedral coordinated vanadium atom and one four-coordinated copper atom and they further gave rise to a 1D network by the Cu-O and V-O bonds. More importantly, these POVCFs were further studied in the construction of C-N bond reactions of primary amines under mild conditions, and it was found that POVCF 1 displayed efficient heterogeneous catalytic activities in the Chan-Lam reaction (yields up to 89%)."
