Originally intended for use with X-ray therapy, the possibility of enhanced hadron therapy is desirable due to the superior sparing of healthy tissue in hadron therapy compared to conventional X-ray therapy. While MNPs were not expected to be effective radiosensitisers for hadron therapy due to the limited Z dependence of interactions, recent experimental measurements have contradicted this expectation. Key experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations of MNP radiosensitisation for hadron irradiation are reviewed in the current work. Numerous experimental measurements have found a large radiosensitisation effect due to MNPs for proton and carbon ion irradiation. Experiments have also indicated that the radiosensitisation is due in large part to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Simulations have found a large radial dose and ROS enhancement on the nanoscale around a single MNP. However, the short range of the dose enhancement is insufficient for a large macroscale dose enhancement or enhanced biological effect in a cell model considering dose to the nucleus from GNPs in the cytoplasm (a distribution observed in most experiments)."

While surgery and radiation (RT) are first line therapy, no effective systemic medical treatment has been identified. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Here, we examined radiosensitizing effects of LB-100, a novel inhibitor of PP2A against AAM as a novel treatment strategy. Three human-derived immortalized meningioma cell lines, IOMM-LEE, GAR, and CH-157, were used to investigate the radio-sensitizing potential of LB-100 in AAM. Survival fraction by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence, cell cycle analysis and protein expression were evaluated in\u00a0vitro. The antitumor effects of combining LB-100 with RT were verified in\u00a0vivo by using intracranial orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Pharmacologic PP2A inhibition with LB-100 prior to RT enhanced the radiosensitivity of meningioma cells and reduced survival fraction in clonogenic assays. LB-100 increased DNA double-strand breakage (measured by \u03b3-H2AX), mitotic catastrophe cell death, and G2/M cell cycle arrest in irradiated meningioma cells. Also, LB-100 decreased activation of STAT3 and expression of its downstream proteins. In\u00a0vivo, LB-100 and RT combined treatment prolonged the survival of mice with xenografts compared to RT alone. Taken together, these results provide convincing preclinical data to support the use of LB-100 as a radiosensitizing agent for treatment of malignant meningioma. Its potential for clinical application deserves further investigation."

In this study, noncontact co-cultures of rat primary BMSCs and VECs were employed to interrogate paracrine cell-to-cell communications in response to tension. Exposure of VECs to 6% tension for 48\u2005h elicited neither ALP activity nor mRNA expression of OCN and OPN in BMSCs incubated in a shared culture medium. Instead, BMSCs subjected to tension induced robust VEGF release, and its conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation and tubular formation of VECs with a concurrent increase in BMP-2 and IGF-1 production. Conditioned medium from activated VECs in turn promoted expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs, followed by an increase in matrix mineralization. The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate that the response of BMSCs to tension potentiates paracrine osteogenic signaling from VECs; this positive feedback loop is initiated by VEGF release."

In this study, a microfluidic device was proposed to generate uniform water-in-oil cell-encapsulating micro-droplets, followed by the fluorescence-based optical detection of lactic acid produced within the micro-droplets. To test its feasibility to quantify cancer cells, experiments were carried out. Results showed that the detection signals were proportional to the number of cancer cells within the micro-droplets, whereas such signals were insensitive to the existence and number of leukocytes within. To further demonstrate its feasibility for cancer cell detection, the cancer cells with known cell number in a cell suspension was detected based on the method. Results revealed that there was no significant difference between the detected number and the real number of cancer cells. As a whole, the proposed method opens up a new route to detect live CTCs in a label-free manner. "

However, systemic administration of CyA could create serious adverse effects. Therefore, it is our long-term goal to test the hypothesis that the controlled local release of CyA from a polymeric vascular wrap would prevent the development of IH. To test this hypothesis, we developed a controlled release polymeric ring that could be placed around anastomotic sites to deliver therapeutic drugs locally. The ring is a composite polymeric device consisting of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres embedded in a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel. Several in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of different sterilization procedures on the properties of the device. It was determined that gamma sterilization was the preferred sterilization method of choice for this device. In vivo studies were conducted on a swine model to evaluate the biocompatibility of the ring. The histological findings of the ring implants at 2 and 4 weeks demonstrate the biocompatibility of this device."

Upon UV irradiation of primate cells, UV-DDB associates tightly with chromatin, concomitant with the loss of extractable binding activity. We report here that an early event after UV, but not ionizing, radiation is the transient dose-dependent degradation of the small subunit, p48. Treatment of human cells with the proteasomal inhibitor NIP-L3VS blocks this UV-induced degradation of p48. In XP-E cell lines with impaired UV-DDB binding, p48 is resistant to degradation. UV-mediated degradation of p48 occurs independently of the expression of p53 and the cell's proficiency for NER, but recovery of p48 levels at later times (12 h and thereafter) is dependent upon the capacity of the cell to repair non-transcribed DNA. In addition, we find that the p127 subunit of UV-DDB binds in vivo to p300, a histone acetyltransferase. The data support a functional connection between UV-DDB binding activity, proteasomal degradation of p48 and chromatin remodeling during early steps of NER."

A unique phenotypic attribute of fibrocytes and CD34(+) OFs is their expression of the functional thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and other \"thyroid-specific\" proteins. When activated through TSHR, fibrocytes express a number of cytokines and other inflammatory genes. Here we sought to determine whether pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), an acute-phase protein involved in inflammation and autoimmunity, might be induced by TSH in fibrocytes and OFs. These cells were collected from patients with Graves disease and healthy individuals. PTX-3 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR, protein was determined by ELISA and Western blot, and PTX-3 gene promoter activity was assessed with reporter assays. PTX-3 expression was induced by TSH in both cell types, regardless of the health status of the donor and was a consequence of increased steady-state PTX-3 mRNA levels. M22, a TSHR-activating monoclonal antibody, also induced PTX-3. The induction could be attenuated by dexamethasone and by IGF-I receptor-blocking antibodies, teprotumumab and 1H7. TSH effects were mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin/p70(s6k), Janus tyrosine kinase 2 pathways, and enhanced PTX-3 mRNA stability. These findings indicate that PTX-3 is a TSH target gene, the expression of which can be induced in fibrocytes and OFs. They suggest that PTX-3 might represent a previously unidentified nexus between the thyroid axis and the mechanisms involved in tissue remodeling. "

An urgent need exists for adjuvant treatments that can enhance or replace current therapeutic options. Here we show the potential of LB100, a small-molecule protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) inhibitor, as a monotherapy and chemosensitizing agent for sAML using an in-vitro and in-vivo approach. We demonstrate that LB100 decreases cell viability through caspase activation and G2/M cell-cycle arrest. LB100 enhances daunorubicin (DNR) cytotoxicity resulting in decreased xenograft volumes and improved overall survival. LB100 profoundly upregulates miR-181b-1, which we show directly binds to the 3' untranslated region of Bcl-2 mRNA leading to its translational inhibition. MiR-181b-1 ectopic overexpression further diminishes Bcl-2 expression leading to suppression of sAML cell growth, and enhancement of DNR cytotoxicity. Our research highlights the therapeutic potential of LB100, and provides new insights into the mechanism of LB100 chemosensitization."

More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series."

We also show that the RNA binding activity of the Rbfox family protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1 mRNA and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure.

Although favorable response was obtained, she started complaining of shortness of breath 7 months after initiating dasatinib treatment. Chest X-ray and echocardiography indicated pulmonary congestion and hypertension. Further, she was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) based on Raynaud phenomenon, swollen fingers, sclerodactyly, pancytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positive anti-U1-RNP antibody. Consequently, dasatinib treatment was discontinued, and she was administered prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), which was effective and successfully tapered with concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide. This is the first case of MCTD that developed during dasatinib treatment. However, because the present case was a young woman, the development of MCTD could probably be attributed to autoimmune diatheses or it may be a coincidence. However, the possibility of patients receiving dasatinib treatment developing autoimmune diseases needs to be assessed."

CSS is a rare congenital malformation syndrome characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability (ID), coarse facial appearance, feeding difficulties, frequent infections, and hypoplasia/aplasia of the fifth fingernails and fifth distal phalanges. In 2012, 42 years after the first description of CSS in 1970, five causative genes (SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SMARCA4, ARID1A, ARID1B), all encoding components of the BAF complex, were identified as being responsible for CSS through whole exome sequencing and pathway-based genetic screening. The identification of two additional causative genes (PHF6, SOX11) followed. Mutations in another BAF complex gene (SMARCA2) and (TBC1D24) were found to cause clinically similar conditions with ID, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome and DOORS syndrome, respectively. Also, ADNP was found to be mutated in an autism/ID syndrome. Furthermore, there is growing evidences for germline or somatic mutations in the BAF complex genes to be causal for cancer/cancer predisposition syndromes. These discoveries have highlighted the role of the BAF complex in the human development and cancer formation. The biology of BAF is very complicated and much remains unknown. Ongoing research is required to reveal the whole picture of the BAF complex in human development, and will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for related disorders in the future."

Here, we longitudinally and comprehensively characterize microvascular responses to AZD8601, a modified mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), in vivo. Using multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy, we show that intradermal injection of AZD8601 formulated in a biocompatible vehicle results in pronounced, sustained and dose-dependent vasodilation, blood flow upregulation, and neovessel formation, in striking contrast to those induced by recombinant human VEGF-A protein, a non-translatable variant of AZD8601, and citrate/saline vehicle. Moreover, we evaluate the bioactivity of AZD8601 in a mouse model of diabetic wound healing in vivo. Using a boron nanoparticle-based tissue oxygen sensor, we show that sequential dosing of AZD8601 improves vascularization and tissue oxygenation of the wound bed, leading to accelerated re-epithelialization during the early phase of diabetic wound healing."

To date, the disease pathophysiology has been thought to be primarily driven by cell-autonomous mechanisms, but, here, we demonstrate that fibroblasts derived from HD patients carrying either 72, 143 and 180 CAG repeats as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) also characterized by 143 CAG repeats can transmit protein aggregates to genetically unrelated and healthy host tissue following implantation into the cerebral ventricles of neonatal mice in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Transmitted mHtt aggregates gave rise to both motor and cognitive impairments, loss of striatal medium spiny neurons, increased inflammation and gliosis in associated brain regions, thereby recapitulating the behavioural and pathological phenotypes which characterizes HD. In addition, both in vitro work using co-cultures of mouse neural stem cells with 143 CAG fibroblasts and the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line as well as in vivo experiments conducted in newborn wild-type mice suggest that exosomes can cargo mHtt between cells triggering the manifestation of HD-related behaviour and pathology. This is the first evidence of human-to-mouse prion-like propagation of mHtt in the mammalian brain; a finding which will help unravel the molecular bases of HD pathology as well as to lead to the development of a whole new range of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS."

By mammalian one- or two-hybrid experiments in HEK293 cells, we compared transcriptional repression activities of 61 human KRAB-ZNFs. The results showed that six SCAN-KRAB-containing ZNFs are KAP1-independent transcriptional repressors whose SCAN-KRAB domain is unable to associate with KAP1 despite retaining transcriptional repression activity. Transcriptional repression activities of the SCAN-KRAB domain of KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs are not influenced by depletion of endogenous KAP1 levels by small interfering RNA. Although the mechanism by which KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs repress transcriptional activity remains to be elucidated, it appears that there may be a pathway for transcriptional repression that does not involve KAP1. These results provide new insight into the functions of the members of the KRAB-ZNF family."

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GB/SA) calculations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Asciminib resistance induced by the two mutants. The obtained results indicate that the mutations have adversely influence on the binding of Asciminib to BCR-ABL, as the nonpolar contributions decline in the two mutants. In addition, I502L mutation causes \u03b1-helix I' (\u03b1I') to shift away from the helical bundle composed of \u03b1E, \u03b1F, and \u03b1H, making the distance between \u03b1I' and Asciminib increased. For V468F mutant, the side chain of Phe468 occupies the bottom of the myristoyl pocket (MP), which drives Asciminib to shift toward the outside of MP. Our results provide the molecular insights of Asciminib resistance mechanism in BCR-ABL mutants, which may help the design of novel inhibitors."

We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer."

An intensified insulin regimen is often unsuccessful, while other therapeutic options, such as amylin analog injections, use of continuous glucose sensors, and islet or pancreas transplantation are of limited clinical use. In efforts to provide patients with a more compliable treatment method, Oramed Pharmaceuticals tested the capacity of its oral insulin capsule (ORMD-0801, 8 mg insulin) in addressing this resistant clinical state. Eight Type I diabetes patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c: 7.5-10%) were monitored throughout the 15-day study period by means of a blind continuous glucose monitoring device. Baseline patient blood glucose behavior was monitored and recorded over a five-day pretreatment screening period. During the ensuing ten-day treatment phase, patients were asked to conduct themselves as usual and to self-administer an oral insulin capsule three times daily, just prior to meal intake. CGM data sufficient for pharmacodynamics analyses were obtained from 6 of the 8 subjects. Treatment with ORMD-0801 was associated with a significant 24.4% reduction in the frequencies of glucose readings >200 mg/dL (60.1 \u00b1 7.9% pretreatment vs. 45.4 \u00b1 4.9% during ORMD-0801 treatment; p\u200a=\u200a0.023) and a significant mean 16.6% decrease in glucose area under the curve (AUC) (66055 \u00b1 5547 mg/dL/24 hours vs. 55060 \u00b1 3068 mg/dL/24 hours, p\u200a=\u200a0.023), with a greater decrease during the early evening hours. In conclusion, ORMD-0801 oral insulin capsules in conjunction with subcutaneous insulin injections, well tolerated and effectively reduced glycemia throughout the day."

The present study was therefore undertaken to clarify any isoform-specific differences in terms of their functions and nucleocytoplasmic localization. All isoforms primarily localized in the nucleus. However, heterokaryon analysis and a study using RNA polymerase II inhibitor revealed that p40/p37 exhibited a continuous shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Constant nuclear retention activity was mapped to the p45/p42-specific sequence at the C-terminal region, which is retained by alternative splicing. Using this domain as a probe, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and we found that scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B), a nuclear matrix-associated protein, exhibits protein-protein interaction to this region. Colocalization of p45/p42 and SAF-B was observed as a speckle in the nucleus. Interestingly, p45/p42 isoforms appeared to act as a negative regulator in gene expression by forming a complex with SAF-B. Thus, the present study revealed that the isoform-specific functions of AUF1/hnRNP D are defined by intracellular shuttling capacity."

Dynamic chromatin conformation and spatial organization of the genome constitute a major step in this regulation to modulate developmental outputs. Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) mediate stable or flexible gene repression in response to internal and environmental cues. In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA. Here, we show that LHP1 is responsible for the spreading of H3K27me3 towards the 3' end of the gene body. We also identified a subset of LHP1-activated genes and demonstrated that LHP1 shapes local chromatin topology in order to control transcriptional co-regulation. Our work reveals a general role of LHP1 from local to higher conformation levels of chromatin configuration to determine its accessibility to define gene expression patterns. "

Phase II clinical trials in schizophrenia with two selective NK3 antagonists (osanetant and talnetant) have demonstrated significant improvement in positive symptoms. The objective of this study was to characterize the properties of a novel dual NK2/NK3 antagonist, RO5328673. [(3)H]RO5328673 bound to a single saturable site on hNK2, hNK3 and gpNK3 with high-affinity. RO5328673 acted as an insurmountable antagonist at both human and guinea-pig NK3 receptors in the [(3)H]IP accumulation assay. In binding kinetic analyses, [(3)H]RO5328673 had fast association and dissociation rates at hNK2 while it had a fast association rate and a remarkably slow dissociation rate at gp and hNK3. In electrophysiological recordings of gp SNpc, RO5328673 inhibited the senktide-induced potentiation of spontaneous activity of dopaminergic neurons with an insurmountable mechanism of action. RO5328673 exhibited in-vivo activity in gerbils, robustly reversing the senktide-induced locomotor activity. The TM2 residue gpNK3-A114(2.58) (threonine in all other species) was identified as the critical residue for the RO5328673's slower dissociation kinetics and stronger insurmountable mode of antagonism in the guinea-pig as compared to hNK3-T139(2.58). Using site-directed mutagenesis, [(3)H]RO5328673 binding and rhodopsin-based modeling, the important molecular determinants of the RO5328673-binding pocket of hNK3 were determined. A comparison of the RO5328673-binding pocket with that of osanetant showed that two antagonists have similar contact sides on hNK3 binding crevice except for three mutations V95L(1.42), Y247W(5.38), V255I(5.46), which behaved differently between interacting modes of two antagonists in hNK3.

In our study, we investigated the effect of saracatinib on the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) induced by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that saracatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABCB1 substrate drugs in ABCB1 overexpressing HeLa/v200, MCF-7/adr and HEK293/ABCB1 cells, an effect that was stronger than that of gefitinib, whereas it had no effect on the cytotoxicity of the substrates in ABCC1 overexpressing HL-60/adr cells and its parental sensitive cells. Additionally, saracatinib significantly increased the doxorubicin (Dox) and Rho 123 accumulation in HeLa/v200 and MCF-7/adr cells, whereas it had no effect on HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding cavity of human ABCB1. However, neither the expression level of ABCB1 nor the phosphorylation level of Akt was altered at the reversal concentrations of saracatinib. Importantly, saracatinib significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel against ABCB1-overexpressing HeLa/v200 cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, saracatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vitro and in vivo by directly inhibiting ABCB1 transport function, without altering ABCB1 expression or AKT phosphorylation. These findings may be helpful to attenuate the effect of MDR by combining saracatinib with other chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinic."

Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal hunchback (hb) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described-repression of maternal bicoid (bcd) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3'-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of bcd in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of bcd mRNA or protein.

It performs local realignments on the fly for more accurate allele frequency estimation.

In addition, VarDict performs amplicon aware variant calling for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based targeted sequencing often used in diagnostic settings, and is able to detect PCR artifacts. Finally, VarDict also detects differences in somatic and loss of heterozygosity variants between paired samples. VarDict reprocessing of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset called known driver mutations in KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA and MET in 16% more patients than previously published variant calls.

Central to this regulation is Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to promote microtubule turnover. A critical target of Aurora B is the N-terminal \"tail\" domain of Hec1, which is a component of the NDC80 complex, a force-transducing link between kinetochores and microtubules. Although Aurora B is regarded as the \"master regulator\" of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, other mitotic kinases likely contribute to Hec1 phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase regulates kinetochore-microtubule dynamics of metaphase chromosomes, and we identify Hec1 S69, a previously uncharacterized phosphorylation target site in the Hec1 tail, as a critical Aurora A substrate for this regulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase associates with inner centromere protein (INCENP) during mitosis and that INCENP is competent to drive accumulation of the kinase to the centromere region of mitotic chromosomes. These findings reveal that both Aurora A and B contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment dynamics, and they uncover an unexpected role for Aurora A in late mitosis."

These areas draw travelers from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for cholera.

Characteristic examples are gene expression networks or protein-protein interaction networks, which hold information about functional affinities or structural similarities. Such networks have been expanding in size due to increasing scale and abundance of biological data. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of \u223c70 million nodes with \u223c68 billion edges in \u223c2.4 h. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks.

Trastuzumab, an anti-Her2 antibody, was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2010 as first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy for Her2-positive disease. Since then, strategies targeting Her2 that have been successful in Her2-positive breast cancer, have failed in EGC. The one remaining study, the phase III Jacob study with pertuzumab, has yet to be presented. The anti-VEGF receptor 2 antibody, ramucirumab has been investigated as second-line therapy in 2 phase III trials, which resulted in improved survival, with subsequent FDA approval of ramucirumab in the second-line setting. Therapies targeting EGFR have been evaluated in a number of phase III studies, all of which have been negative. Phase III investigation of an mTOR inhibitor did not improve survival, although biomarker studies are awaited which may identify subgroups of patients that may benefit from its use. The results of the trials targeting MET in EGC have been disappointing, raising doubts about the usefulness of further testing agents that inhibit the MET pathway. PARP inhibition with olaparib, warrants further investigation, possibly in combination with other targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibition and in a biomarker-selected population. The identification of CLDN18.2 and its targeting with claudiximab is very promising and will be further investigated in a phase III study."

The resulting 50 samples that were positive for HPV-DNA were subjected to genotype identification. Forty-six of these samples had detectable genotypes by LIPA analysis and most (78%, 36/46) had multiple low risk (LR) and high risk (HR) genotypes on the cervix. Twenty-five of these samples (54%) had more than 1 HR genotype. Of the 36 patients who had any HR genotypes, 18 (50%) were identified to have the most oncogenic HPV genotypes, namely 16 and 18. Three of these samples had both 16 and 18 on the cervix.   The presence of multiple HR genotypes on the majority of cervical samples from a self-referred population of females with EGW is presented. This study is of importance since persistent HR-HPV is the necessary risk factor in the development of precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. Gardisil, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine would have been useful in the prevention of 28% (13/46) of these infections."

In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions."

She was treated with interferon, prednisolone, and high-dose gamma-globulin (400 mg/day x 5 days). However, the platelet count did not increase, but hypermenorrhea continued. She subsequently showed proteinuria and hematuria. She underwent splenectomy and renal biopsy on August 12, 1992. The glomeruli appeared to be almost normal under light microscopy. The interstitium showed regional fibrosis containing foam cells and the renal tubuli showed mild atrophy. Under electronmicroscopy, the basement membrane of the glomeruli was associated with mesangial interposition and the lamina densa was split into several layers.

Animals (n\u00a0=\u00a0150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4\u00a0weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals. Verification of these findings in humans is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial on elderly hip fracture patients."

In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico survey and comparative analysis of these extra open reading frames (ORFs) in the group of Ty3/gypsy LTR retrotransposons as the first step towards our understanding of their origin and function. We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77\u00a0%) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. This lineage was also characterized by the highest diversity of extra ORF arrangement (position and orientation) within the elements. On the other hand, all of these ORFs could be classified into only two broad groups based on their mutual similarities or the presence of short conserved motifs in their inferred protein sequences. In the Athila lineage, the extra ORFs were confined to the element 3' regions but they displayed much higher sequence diversity compared to those found in Tat. In the lineage of Chromoviruses the extra ORFs were relatively rare, occurring only in 5' regions of a group of elements present in a single plant family (Poaceae). In all three lineages, most extra ORFs lacked sequence similarities to characterized gene sequences or functional protein domains, except for two Athila-like elements with similarities to LOGL4 gene and part of the Chromoviruses extra ORFs that displayed partial similarity to histone H3 gene. Thus, in these cases the extra ORFs most likely originated by transduction or recombination of cellular gene sequences. In addition, the protein domain which is otherwise associated with DNA transposons have been detected in part of the Tat-like extra ORFs, pointing to their origin from an insertion event of a mobile element."

Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study, we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete, because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies and retroviral gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes, and severe lupus nephritis, which was not the case in male B6.Nba2 mice lacking the Yaa mutation. Moreover, we found that the Tlr7 gene duplication contributed to the development of monocytosis, but not to the reduction of marginal zone B cells, which both are cellular abnormalities causally linked to the Yaa mutation. Our results indicate that the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE as well as various Yaa-linked cellular traits cannot be explained by the Tlr7 gene duplication alone, and suggest additional contributions from other duplicated genes in the translocated X chromosome."

The genome encodes thousands of proteins but not all of them are expressed in every cell type; and expressed proteins are not active at all times. Such diversity of protein expression and function accounts for the level of biological intricacy seen in nature. Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex \"map\" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization. Here we describe how the map has provided valuable insights into protein function in addition to generating hundreds of testable hypotheses. We also discuss recent technological advancements that will be critical in addressing the next generation of questions arising from the map."

The BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 Phase III trials successfully demonstrated that belimumab (10 mg/kg) with standard therapy significantly decreased disease activity in SLE patients compared to placebo with standard therapy. Overall, belimumab has been found to be safe and well tolerated. While the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 studies are the largest clinical trials in SLE to date, they mainly focused on musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous, hematologic and general constitutional features of the disease. Patients with severe lupus nephritis and severe central nervous system disease were excluded from these trials. Studies of belimumab in lupus nephritis are ongoing that may clarify the role of this agent in the clinical management of SLE. "

KMT2C (hereafter referred to as MLL3) frequently incurs point mutations across a range of human tumor types, but precisely how these lesions alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis is unclear. Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo. This study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic effects of PHD-associated mutations in MLL3 and suggests that restoration of a balanced state of Polycomb-COMPASS activity may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors that bear mutations in the genes encoding these epigenetic factors."

IFNgamma treatment and Bik expression increase cathepsin B and D messenger RNA levels and reduce levels of phospho-extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the nuclei of bik(+/+) compared with bik(-/-) murine AECs. Bik but not BikL61G interacts with and suppresses nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2, and suppression of ERK1/2 activation inhibits IFNgamma- and Bik-induced cell death. Furthermore, after prolonged exposure to allergen, hyperplastic epithelial cells persist longer, and nuclear phospho-ERK is more prevalent in airways of IFNgamma(-/-) or bik(-/-) compared with wild-type mice.

Here, we use Myc-induced cell competition to demonstrate that loser cell elimination requires local wing disc synthesis of Spz. We identify Spz processing enzyme (SPE) and modular serine protease (ModSP) as activators of Spz-regulated competitive signaling and show that \"winner\" cells trigger elimination of nearby WT cells by boosting SPE production. Moreover, Spz requires both Toll and Toll-8 to induce apoptosis of wing disc cells. Thus, during cell competition, Spz-mediated signaling is strictly confined to the imaginal disc, allowing errors in tissue fitness to be corrected without compromising organismal physiology."

The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage.

Most cases of Cushing's syndrome are due to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone production from a pituitary adenoma, which is referred to as Cushing's disease. Most of the signs and symptoms are nonspecific and common in the general population, making a diagnosis often challenging. However, several dermatological manifestations, such as fragile skin, easy bruising, and reddish purple striae, are more discriminatory. Because uncontrolled Cushing's syndrome of any etiology is associated with substantial morbidity, including increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, it is important to make an early diagnosis. Unfortunately, median delays of 2 years to diagnosis have been reported. We report a case of a woman who had multiple dermatological findings, including facial plethora, easy bruising, violaceous striae, hirsutism, and acne, the latter 2 signs reflecting androgen excess. Of interest, our patient presented with a chief complaint of hair loss, a common complaint in the general population that occurs with a greater frequency in patients with Cushing's disease and is attributed to androgenetic alopecia, but it is rarely the presenting symptom."

In many parts of the world cholera is still endemic, causing outbreaks and constituting repeatedly serious public health problems. The oral live cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Orochol, Mutachol), the first genetically modified organism (GMO) used as vaccine, was in its time (launched 1993, Switzerland) the ideal cholera vaccine: single-dose, protective efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus, demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10, 2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need. "

Many of these cytokines trigger cellular effects and functions through signaling via janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules. In this way, JAK/STAT signaling controls important events like cell differentiation, secretion of cytokines or proliferation and apoptosis in IBD in both adaptive and innate immune cells. Moreover, JAK/STAT signaling, especially via the IL-6/STAT3 axis, is believed to be involved in the transition of inflammatory lesions to tumors leading to colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In this review, we will introduce the main cellular players and cytokines that contribute to pathogenesis of IBD by JAK/STAT signaling, and will highlight the integrative function that JAK/STATs exert in this context as well as their divergent role in different cells and processes. Moreover, we will explain current concepts of the implication of JAK/STAT signaling in CAC and finally discuss present and future therapies for IBD that interfere with JAK/STAT signaling. "

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients ("

In addition to sampling H3 and H4 modification status, we show that the DPF cooperates with the MYST domain to promote H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, although not if H3K4 is trimethylated. Four crystal structures of an extended DPF alone and in complex with unmodified or acetylated forms of the H3 tail reveal the molecular basis of crosstalk between H3K4me3 and H3K14ac. We show for the first time that MOZ DPF induces \u03b1-helical conformation of H3K4-T11, revealing a unique mode of H3 recognition. The helical structure facilitates sampling of H3K4 methylation status, and proffers H3K9 and other residues for modification. Additionally, we show that a conserved double glycine hinge flanking the H3 tail helix is required for a conformational change enabling docking of H3K14ac with the DPF. In summary, our data provide the first observations of extensive helical structure in a histone tail, revealing the inherent ability of the H3 tail to adopt alternate conformations in complex with chromatin regulators.

PTEN pseudogene (PTENp) acts as an endogenous RNA, which regulates its parental gene by competitively binding to the 3' UTR of PTEN gene in the human. Despite the importance of this pseudogene, little is known about the molecular evolution of PTENp in mammals. In this study, we identified 37 pseudogenes from 65 mammalian genomes. Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3'UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR."

Current treatment guidelines suggest using a combination of steroid- and etoposide-based chemotherapy. CASE REPORT The authors present a case of a 41-year-old African-American female who presented with symptoms of foodborne illness and who developed multi-organ dysfunction. HLH was suspected because of poor response to broad-spectrum antibiotics with a constellation of findings, including cytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperferritinemia. Clinical improvement was noted after administration of intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone while waiting for the soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels; therefore, chemotherapy was not administered.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS Despite the variable and poor prognosis of HLH, early treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive therapy is crucial to improving the survival rate. The inclusion of immunoglobulin therapy should be considered a treatment option for HLH."

HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; control experiments demonstrated that butyrate did not significantly inhibit DNA replication for at least 70 min. Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin replicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead retained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, sodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated chromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the following criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to mononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal nuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of chromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin replication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses normal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and histone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while deacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation apparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core particle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure."

Gross changes in rCBF are due to variation in vessel diameter. Changes of rCBF also reflect synaptic activity (inhibition and excitation). Therefore, PET was used to monitor changes in blood flow during the aura and headache phase of a migraine attack and to investigate focal areas of increased or decreased blood flow, e.g., in the brain stem and midbrain. Hemispheric rCBF was unchanged in spontaneous migraine attacks without aura. This was true for the headache side as well as for the nonheadache side. Sumatriptan had no effects on cerebral blood flow. Regional cerebral blood flow was increased in midline brain stem structures during the headache phase, but also when the headache had been treated with sumatriptan. This persisting increased activity might reflect activity of a presumed migraine center in the brain stem. These changes are specific for migraine attacks and are not seen during attacks of cluster headache. Positron emission tomography measurements in the early phase of a migraine attack in a single subject showed flow reductions in the occipital cortex spreading forwards; an observation which would be compatible with the existence of spreading depression in humans. Our attempts to study the aura phase with PET have, to date, been unsuccessful."

Therefore, the influence of radiation as a risk factor for cancer development has been among the most studied external factors over the last 6 decades, particularly with respect to radiosensitive tissues and organs. It has been known that female breast tissue is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, particularly when exposure takes place at younger age. All women are exposed to low doses of radiation for several common reasons (kind of occupation, medical diagnostic procedures, residence background radiation) whose effects on breast cancer development cannot be documented, and thus it is believed that ionizing radiation is not primary or major risk factor leading to development of breast cancer. Radiobiological studies revealed a specific event caused by radiation through recognition of the critical target in radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Accordingly, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation are evidenced both in vitro and in vivo, although the incidence of radiation-induced cancers is low. The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy for either malignant or non-malignant diseases, including benign breast diseases in their childhood or young age. Therefore, as a means of prevention in this group of population, indications for application of ionizing radiation, both diagnostic and therapeutic, should be highly selective, meaning that radiation should be applied only if the possible benefit outweighs the risk."

Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities: grade 4 neutropenia/grade 3 leukopenia (n\u2009=\u20091, 12\u00a0mg/kg) and grade 3 infusion reaction (n\u2009=\u20091 each, 4\u00a0mg/kg and 12\u00a0mg/kg); the maximum tolerated dose was 8\u00a0mg/kg. Four (three FL and one DLBCL) patients achieved complete response; eight (six FL and two DLBCL) achieved partial response. Overall response rate was 60%. Over the dose ranges evaluated, the pharmacokinetic profile of inebilizumab in Japanese patients was generally dose proportional.

It is well known that several steps are necessary for this process, including cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, resistance to anoikis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism of regulating cancer metastasis progress may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. Recent studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in cancer metastasis. lncRNAs are the nonprotein coding RNAs that have a size longer than 200 nucleotides. More and more studies have indicated that lncRNAs are involved in a broad range of biological processes and are associated with many diseases, such as cancer. The role of lncRNAs in cancer metastasis has been widely studied; however, lncRNAs are mainly involved in the EMT process on the current literature. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in cancer metastasis. "

In order to find human genomic sites capable of supporting long-term and high-level transgene expression in hPSCs, we performed a lentiviral screen in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We isolated 40 iPSC clones each harboring a single vector copy and characterized the level of transgene expression afforded by each unique integration site. We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The LiPS-A3 line can greatly facilitate the insertion of reporter and other genes in hPSCs. Targeting transgenes in the LiPS-A3S genomic locus can find broad applications in stem cell research and possibly cell and gene therapy."

By studying age-dependent changes of THP knockout (KO) mice, we show here that young KO mice had significant salt and water wasting but were partially responsive to furosemide, due to decreased luminal translocation of Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) in the TAL. Aged THP KO mice were, however, markedly oliguric and unresponsive to furosemide, and their NKCC2 was localized primarily in the cytoplasm as evidenced by lipid raft floatation assay, cell fractionation, and confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. These aged KO mice responded to metolazone and acetazolamide, known to target distal and proximal tubules, respectively. They also had marked upregulation of renin in juxtaglomerular apparatus and serum, and they were hypertensive. Finally, the aged THP KO mice had significant upregulation of Na-coupled urate transporters Slc5a8 and Slc22a12 as well as sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the proximal tubule and elevated serum uric acid and allantoin. Collectively, our results suggest that THP deficiency can cause progressive disturbances in renal functions via initially NKCC2 dysfunction and later compensatory responses, resulting in prolonged activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and hyperuricemia."

Hot flushes are subjective sensation of heat associated with cutaneous vasodilatation and drop in core temperature. It is suspected that VMS are strongly correlated with pulsatile oversecretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequently luteinizing hormone (LH). Evidence has accumulated in parallel showing that lack of negative feedback of steroid hormones synthesized in ovary causes overactivation of hypertrophied kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons, located in infundibular nucleus. Oversecretion of both kisspeptin (KISS1) and neurokinin B (NKB), as well as downregulation of dynorphin, plays dominant role in creation of GnRH pulses. This in turn causes VMS. Administration of senktide, highly potent and selective NK3R agonist, resulted in increase of serum LH concentration, induction of VMS, increase in heart rate, and skin temperature in postmenopausal women. These finding suggest that modulation of KNDy neurons may become new therapeutic approach in the treatment of VMS."

We detected 109 genes that were significantly up-regulated in TAC mice and a majority of these were down-regulated in response to temocapril, olmesartan or their combination which significantly attenuated cardiac remodeling at one or four weeks. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that olmesartan, temocapril or their combination down-regulated the expression of periostin. In MI mice treated with olmesartan for 4 weeks, the left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic dimensions measured with echocardiography were lower, whereas maximum rate of rise and fall rate of LV pressure (\u00b1dp/dt max) were greater, and Azan-staining cardiac fibrotic area was smaller. Furthermore, periostin was upregulated in response to MI, whereas olmesartan blocked this upregulation. Post-MI fibrosis was smaller in periostin knockout adult mice than in wildtype mice, while glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 was increased and cyclin D1 was decreased in periostin knockout mice. These findings indicate that periostin is a target gene of ARB and olmesartan reverses cardiac remodeling at least partially through the downregulation of periostin."

These findings may explain the higher prevalence of SLE in females and the reported decreased therapeutic efficacy of synthetic TLR7 ligands in male individuals."

However, current protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage and hence methods to predict missing methylation states are critical to enable genome-wide analyses. We report DeepCpG, a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict methylation states in single cells. We evaluate DeepCpG on single-cell methylation data from five cell types generated using alternative sequencing protocols. DeepCpG yields substantially more accurate predictions than previous methods. Additionally, we show that the model parameters can be interpreted, thereby providing insights into how sequence composition affects methylation variability."

In many parts of the world cholera is still endemic, causing outbreaks and constituting repeatedly serious public health problems. The oral live cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Orochol, Mutachol), the first genetically modified organism (GMO) used as vaccine, was in its time (launched 1993, Switzerland) the ideal cholera vaccine: single-dose, protective efficacy of 80-100% against moderate to severe cholera, acting within 8 days and exhibiting excellent safety, indiscernible from placebo. However, there were strong headwinds: In the 1990s the indication for cholera vaccines was generally downplayed by experts and in 1997 the European Commission called for a moratorium of GMOs which blocked the registration in the European Union. Thus, demand for this vaccine remained low and in 2003 it was taken off the market for economic reasons. After a decade in obscurity it (Vaxchora) has resurfaced again, now produced in the U.S. and equipped with a U.S. FDA license (June 10, 2016). What had happened? This commentary gives a critical account of an almost unbelievable string of misadventures, emerging adverse circumstances and man-made failures which nearly killed this single-dose live oral cholera vaccine. The good news is that patience and persistence lead to success in the end, allowing good science to prevail for the benefit of those in need. "

Most companies researching and developing pulmonary administration systems for the use of insulin announced the termination of product development following the failure of the first US FDA-approved inhaled insulin product, Exubera. One company in particular continued their pursuit of a useful inhaled insulin product. MannKind Corporation has developed a powder formulation of insulin that allows for a high percentage of the administered insulin to be absorbed via the lung. Their product, AFREZZA (Technosphere insulin), is currently under review by the FDA for use in patients with diabetes. Technosphere insulin appears to overcome some of the barriers that contributed to the market withdrawal of Exubera by the manufacturer. Studies with Technosphere insulin have shown it to be a unique insulin formulation in that it is very rapid acting, has a relatively short duration of action, and is efficacious in terms of improved glycemic control without contributing to increased weight gain or the incidence of hypoglycemia when compared with other prandial insulin products. Additionally, Technosphere insulin has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in clinical studies to date."

Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power to detect such signals through meta-analyses. In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing, storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS. The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS.

During a copy number variation screen, we noted a paternally inherited chromosome X duplication in 15 independent families. Subsequent genomic analysis demonstrated that an insertional translocation of X chromosomal sequence into the Y chromosome generates an extended PAR [corrected].The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome. The identification of the reciprocal deletion on the X chromosome in one family and the occurrence of the variant in different chromosome Y haplogroups demonstrate this is a recurrent genomic rearrangement in the human population.
