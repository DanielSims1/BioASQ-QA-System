                    "context": "In rodent studies, the gut microbiota has been implicated in facilitating both radioresistance, by protecting the epithelium from apoptotic responses and radiosensitivity, inducing endothelial apoptotic responses. Despite the observation that large animal models, such as the Chinese Rhesus macaque and the Gottingen Minipig, demonstrate similarity to human physiologic responses to radiation, little is known about radiation-induced changes of the gut microbiome in these models. To compare the two models, we used bioequivalent radiation doses which resulted in an LD50 for Gottingen Minipigs and Chinese Rhesus macaques, 1.9\u00a0Gy and 6.8\u00a0Gy, respectively. Fecal samples taken prior and 3 days post-radiation were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Baseline gut microbiota profiles were dissimilar between minipigs and rhesus macaques. Irradiation profoundly impacted gut microbiota profiles in both animals. Significant increases of intracellular symbionts were common to both models and to reported changes in rodents suggesting universality of these findings post-radiation. Remarkably, opposite dynamics were observed for the main phyla, with increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in minipigs but with enrichment of Bacteroidetes in rhesus macaques. Minipig changes in magnitude and in variety of species affected were more extensive than those observed in rhesus macaques. This pilot study provides an important first step in comparing the radiosensitive pig model to the comparatively more radioresistant macaque model, for the identification of microbial elements which may influence radiosensitivity."

Using an inducible degron system in avian cells, we find that AND-1 depletion is incompatible with proliferation, owing to cells accumulating in G2 with activated DNA damage checkpoint. Replication without AND-1 causes fork speed slow-down and accumulation of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at the replication fork junction, with these regions being converted to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in G2. Strikingly, resected forks and DNA damage accumulation in G2, but not fork slow-down, are reverted by treatment with mirin, an MRE11 nuclease inhibitor. Domain analysis of AND-1 further revealed that the HMG box is important for fast replication but not for proliferation, whereas conversely, the WD40 domain prevents fork resection and subsequent DSB-associated lethality. Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability."

Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier."

We evaluated whether there is evidence for excess cardiovascular disease or cancer mortality in early NASA astronauts and if a correlation exists between space radiation exposure and mortality. Astronauts selected from 1959-1969 were included and followed until death or February 2017, with 39 of 73 individuals still alive at that time. Calculated standardized mortality rates for tested outcomes were significantly below U.S. white male population rates, including all-cardiovascular disease (n\u2009=\u20097, SMR\u2009=\u200933; 95% CI, 14-65) and all-cancer (n\u2009=\u20097, SMR\u2009=\u200943; 95% CI, 18-83), as anticipated in a healthy worker population. Space radiation doses for cohort members ranged from 0-78 mGy. No significant associations between space radiation dose and mortality were found using logistic regression with an internal reference group, adjusting for medical radiation. Statistical power of the logistic regression was <6%, remaining <12% even when expected risk level or observed deaths were assumed to be 10 times higher than currently reported. While no excess radiation-associated cardiovascular or cancer mortality risk was observed, findings must be tempered by the statistical limitations of this cohort; notwithstanding, this small unique cohort provides a foundation for assessment of astronaut health."

These escape genes have been reported to be under stronger purifying selection than other X-linked genes. Although it is known that escape from X-inactivation is much more common in humans than in mice, systematic assays of escape in humans have to date employed only interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Here we provide the first systematic next-generation sequencing analysis of escape in a human cell line. We analyzed RNA and genotype sequencing data obtained from B lymphocyte cell lines derived from Europeans (CEU) and Yorubans (YRI). By replicated detection of heterozygosis in the transcriptome, we identified 114 escaping genes, including 76 not previously known to be escapees. The newly described escape genes cluster on the X chromosome in the same chromosomal regions as the previously known escapees. There is an excess of escaping genes associated with mental retardation, consistent with this being a common phenotype of polyX phenotypes. We find both differences between populations and between individuals in the propensity to escape. Indeed, we provide the first evidence for there being both hyper- and hypo-escapee females in the human population, consistent with the highly variable phenotypic presentation of polyX karyotypes. Considering also prior data, we reclassify genes as being always, never, and sometimes escape genes. We fail to replicate the prior claim that genes that escape X-inactivation are under stronger purifying selection than others."

In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Loss of Esc1 (or Nup60) alters SUMO conjugate accumulation and enhances ulp1 mutant defects. Similar to previous findings with Mlp1, both Esc1 and Ulp1 help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Therefore, these proteins are essential for proper nuclear basket function, which includes mRNA surveillance and regulation of SUMO protein dynamics. The results raise the possibility that NPC-localized protein desumoylation may be a key regulatory event preventing inappropriate pre-mRNA export."

                    "context": "Despite early positive response to platinum-based chemotherapy, the majority of ovarian carcinomas develop resistance and progress to fatal disease. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous phosphatase involved in the regulation of DNA-damage response (DDR) and cell-cycle checkpoint pathways. Recent studies have shown that LB100, a small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A, sensitizes cancer cells to radiation-mediated DNA damage. We hypothesized that LB100 could sensitize ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. We performed in vitro studies in SKOV-3, OVCAR-8, and PEO1, -4, and -6 ovarian cancer lines to assess cytotoxicity potentiation, cell-death mechanism(s), cell-cycle regulation, and DDR signaling. In vivo studies were conducted in an intraperitoneal metastatic mouse model using SKOV-3/f-Luc cells. LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and \u03b3H2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites. In vivo, cisplatin sensitization via LB100 significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition and prevented disease progression after treatment cessation. Our results suggest that LB100 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo by modulation of the DDR pathway and cell-cycle checkpoint abrogation."

The specific phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine residue 139, described as \u03b3-H2AX, is an excellent indicator or marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The yield of \u03b3-H2AX (foci) is shown to have some correlation with the dose of radiation or other DSB-causing agents. However, there is some discrepancy in the DNA DSB foci yield among imaging and other methods such as gel electrophoresis. Super-resolution imaging techniques are now becoming widely used as essential tools in biology and medicine, after a slow uptake of their development almost two decades ago. Here we compare several super-resolution techniques used to image and determine the amount and spatial distribution of \u03b3-H2AX foci formation after X-ray irradiation: stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM), as well as an improved confocal, Airyscan and HyVolution 2. We show that by using these super-resolution imaging techniques with as low as 30-nm resolution, each focus may be further resolved, thus increasing the number of foci per radiation dose compared to standard microscopy. Furthermore, the DNA repair proteins 53BP1 (after low-LET irradiations) and Ku70/Ku80 (from laser microbeam irradiation) do not always yield a significantly increased number of foci when imaged by the super-resolution techniques, suggesting that \u03b3-H2AX, 53PB1 and Ku70/80 repair proteins do not fully co-localize on the units of higher order chromatin structure."

Most cancer cells lack major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and cannot present tumour-specific antigens (TSA) directly to CD4(+) T cells. We have reported that tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells collaborate with macrophages and dendritic cells. These professional antigen-presenting cells endocytose and process TSA to display antigenic peptides on their MHC class II molecules for indirect cancer cell recognition by CD4(+) T cells. We hypothesized that this critical step may depend on secretion of TSA by cancer cells. This was investigated in a mouse model for myeloma immunosurveillance mediated by CD4(+) T cells. From this study, several conclusions could be drawn. First, TSA secretion facilitates cancer immunosurveillance. Second, TSA secretion results in stronger activation of na\u00efve tumour-specific CD4(+) T cells in lymph nodes. Third, TSA concentration within the tumour extracellular matrix must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer immunosurveillance. Fourth, treatment by local injection of purified TSA enhances immunity against cancer cells that do not secrete TSA. Fifth, secretion of TSA by at least some cancer cells within a tumour favours antitumour immunity. Therefore, we propose that CD4(+) T cells that recognize secreted TSA may be superior for immunotherapy by T cell transfer, because the local extracellular antigen concentration will be higher for secreted TSA. Thus, it is anticipated that secreted TSA will be more readily detected in vivo by transferred CD4(+) T cells, resulting in more efficient tumour eradication."

We demonstrate that LB100 decreases cell viability through caspase activation and G2/M cell-cycle arrest. LB100 enhances daunorubicin (DNR) cytotoxicity resulting in decreased xenograft volumes and improved overall survival. LB100 profoundly upregulates miR-181b-1, which we show directly binds to the 3' untranslated region of Bcl-2 mRNA leading to its translational inhibition. MiR-181b-1 ectopic overexpression further diminishes Bcl-2 expression leading to suppression of sAML cell growth, and enhancement of DNR cytotoxicity. Our research highlights the therapeutic potential of LB100, and provides new insights into the mechanism of LB100 chemosensitization."

In eukaryotes, diverse DNA lesions from environmental sources are recognized by the xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) nucleotide excision repair complex. Studies of Rad4 (radiation-sensitive 4; yeast XPC ortholog) showed that Rad4 \"opens\" up damaged DNA by inserting a \u03b2-hairpin into the duplex and flipping out two damage-containing nucleotide pairs. However, this DNA lesion \"opening\" is slow (\u02dc5-10 ms) compared with typical submillisecond residence times per base pair site reported for various DNA-binding proteins during 1D diffusion on DNA. To address the mystery as to how Rad4 pauses to recognize lesions during diffusional search, we examine conformational dynamics along the lesion recognition trajectory using temperature-jump spectroscopy. Besides identifying the \u02dc10-ms step as the rate-limiting bottleneck towards opening specific DNA site, we uncover an earlier \u02dc100- to 500-\u03bcs step that we assign to nonspecific deformation (unwinding/\"twisting\") of DNA by Rad4. The \u03b2-hairpin is not required to unwind or to overcome the bottleneck but is essential for full nucleotide-flipping. We propose that Rad4 recognizes lesions in a step-wise \"twist-open\" mechanism, in which preliminary twisting represents Rad4 interconverting between search and interrogation modes. Through such conformational switches compatible with rapid diffusion on DNA, Rad4 may stall preferentially at a lesion site, offering time to open DNA. This study represents the first direct observation, to our knowledge, of dynamical DNA distortions during search/interrogation beyond base pair breathing. Submillisecond interrogation with preferential stalling at cognate sites may be common to various DNA-binding proteins. "

Among the ABC transporter proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are the main members associated with MDR. At present, the roles of these transporters in therapeutic failures have been extensively studied and reviewed in cancer; however, they have rarely been described in autoimmune diseases (AIDs).

AID's basic feature is the production of a large number of autoantibodies, which leads to extensive damage to multiple systems and multiple organs. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly used in the treatment of AID, but a considerable number of patients have no response or develop resistance to these drugs over time. This phenomenon may be related to the abnormal expression of the ABC transporter, which leads to a decrease in the amount of drug entering cells that produce MDR.

Drawing on genetic studies of autoimmune disease, this article discusses how both genes and sex hormones may exert their effects through the same general mechanism, dysregulation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, an immunoregulatory protein. Gene and hormone alterations of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade provide a unifying hypothesis to explain the wide-ranging human and murine autoimmune disease phenotypes regulated by NF-kappaB, including cytokine balance, antigen presentation, lymphoid development, and lymphoid repertoire selection by apoptosis."

Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within the nucleus."

Type 1 is due to an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism; the homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 accounts for more than 90% of the clinical phenotype in populations of Celtic origin. The mutation leads to an inadequately high intestinal iron absorption which may finally cause iron overload in and damage to various organs. Type 2 is the juvenile form of iron overload which leads to a severe phenotype prior to age 30 with cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism. The corresponding mutations are located in the hemojuveline and hepcidin genes. Typ 3 has mainly been described in Italian families and refers to mutations in transferrin receptor 2 gene. Histopathologic and clinical consequences of type 3 hemochromatosis are similar to those seen in type 1. Types 2 and 3 are autosomal recessive traits. Type 4 hemochromatosis follows an autosomal dominant trait; the corresponding mutation affects the basolateral iron carrier ferroportin 1. Diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on determinations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation with the latter being more sensitive and specific. In case of a homozygous C282Y gene test, liver biopsy is not required for diagnosis. Liver biopsy is, however, recommended in C282Y homozygotes at ferritin values > 1,000 ng/ml because of an increased risk for liver fibrosis. Phlebotomy treatment is the standard care to remove iron in genetic hemochromatosis. Patients treated in the early noncirrhotic stage have a normal life expectancy. Thus, future efforts should aim at early diagnosis. Iron removal also improves the outcome in cirrhotic patients. Liver carcinoma may develop in cirrhotic patients despite iron depletion. Liver cancers without cirrhosis are so rare that screening is only recommended in cirrhotic patients."

Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses. We compared responses to anticancer agents ex vivo in organoids and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models with the responses of the patients in clinical trials.

We established an ELISA to measure serum LY6K and found that the proportion of the serum LY6K-positive cases was 38 of 112 (33.9%) NSCLC and 26 of 81 (32.1%) ESCC, whereas only 3 of 74 (4.1%) healthy volunteers were falsely diagnosed. In most cases, there was no correlation between serum LY6K and conventional tumor markers of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19-fragment (CYFRA 21-1) values. A combined ELISA for both LY6K and CEA classified 64.7% of lung adenocarcinoma patients as positive, and the use of both LY6K and CYFRA 21-1 increased sensitivity in the detection of lung squamous cell carcinomas and ESCCs up to 70.4% and 52.5%, respectively, whereas the false positive rate was 6.8% to 9.5%. In addition, knocked down of LY6K expression with small interfering RNAs resulted in growth suppression of the lung and esophageal cancer cells.

While this has already been postulated over 30 years ago, only few examples of evolutionary changes in gene regulation have been verified. Here, we identified and investigated binding sites of the transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPa) aiming to discover cis-regulatory adaptations on the human lineage. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments in a human cell line, we found 11,619 putative GABPa binding sites. Through sequence comparisons of the human GABPa binding regions with orthologous sequences from 34 mammals, we identified substitutions that have resulted in 224 putative human-specific GABPa binding sites. To experimentally assess the transcriptional impact of those substitutions, we selected four promoters for promoter-reporter gene assays using human and African green monkey cells. We compared the activities of wild-type promoters to mutated forms, where we have introduced one or more substitutions to mimic the ancestral state devoid of the GABPa consensus binding sequence. Similarly, we introduced the human-specific substitutions into chimpanzee and macaque promoter backgrounds. Our results demonstrate that the identified substitutions are functional, both in human and nonhuman promoters. In addition, we performed GABPa knock-down experiments and found 1,215 genes as strong candidates for primary targets. Further analyses of our data sets link GABPa to cognitive disorders, diabetes, KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF), and human-specific genes. Thus, we propose that differences in GABPa binding sites played important roles in the evolution of human-specific phenotypes."

Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs."

MVA was attenuated by extensive passage of vaccinia virus Ankara in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Several immunomodulatory genes and genes that influence host range are deleted or mutated, and replication is aborted in the late stage of infection in most nonavian cells. The effect of these mutations on immunogenicity is not well understood. Since the structural genes appear to be intact in MVA, it is hypothesized that critical targets for antibody neutralization have been retained. To test this, we probed microarrays of the Western Reserve (WR) proteome with sera from humans and macaques after MVA and Dryvax vaccination. As most protein sequences of MVA are 97 to 99% identical to those of other vaccinia virus strains, extensive binding cross-reactivity is expected, except for those deleted or truncated. Despite different hosts and immunization regimens, the MVA and Dryvax antibody profiles were broadly similar, with antibodies against membrane and core proteins being the best conserved. The responses to nonstructural proteins were less well conserved, although these are not expected to influence virus neutralization. The broadest antibody response was obtained for hyperimmune rabbits with WR, which is pathogenic in rabbits. These data indicate that, despite the mutations and deletions in MVA, its overall immunogenicity is broadly comparable to that of Dryvax, particularly at the level of antibodies to membrane proteins. The work supports other information suggesting that MVA may be a useful alternative to Dryvax."

The recent studies reach very different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and (11) funding bias. The Interphone studies have all 11 flaws, and the Swedish studies have 3 flaws (8, 9 and 10). The data from the Swedish studies are consistent with what would be expected if cellphone use were a risk for brain tumors, while the Interphone studies data are incredulous. If a risk does exist, the public health cost will be large. These are the circumstances where application of the Precautionary Principle is indicated, especially if low-cost options could reduce the absorbed cellphone radiation by several orders of magnitude."

Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives. We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements. Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population. Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes."

However, it remains unclear how cohesin-mediated interactions contribute to the regulation of gene expression. We have found that the binding of CTCF and cohesin is highly enriched at enhancers and in particular at enhancer arrays or \"super-enhancers\" in mouse thymocytes. Using local and global chromosome conformation capture, we demonstrate that enhancer elements associate not just in linear sequence, but also in 3D, and that spatial enhancer clustering is facilitated by cohesin. The conditional deletion of cohesin from noncycling thymocytes preserved enhancer position, H3K27ac, H4K4me1, and enhancer transcription, but weakened interactions between enhancers. Interestingly, \u223c 50% of deregulated genes reside in the vicinity of enhancer elements, suggesting that cohesin regulates gene expression through spatial clustering of enhancer elements.

Despite great therapeutic advances, most of the MM patients still relapse and remain incurable. Over the past years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new field in cancer therapy. Here, the immune cells of the patients themselves are activated to target the tumor cells. In MM, several effector cells of the immune system are present in the BM microenvironment; unfortunately, they are mostly all functionally impaired. In this review, we focus on the role of innate-like T cells in MM, particularly CD1d- and MR1- restricted T cells such as respectively invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These cells have the capacity upon activation to rapidly release copious amounts of cytokines affecting a wide range of innate and adaptive immune responses, and could therefore play a key protective role in anti-tumor immunity. We describe recent observations with regard to functional exhaustion of iNKT and MAIT cells in MM pathology and discuss the potential application of checkpoint inhibition as an attractive target for prolonged activation of these immunomodulatory T cells in the treatment of MM."

Specifically, super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers defined based on the binding occupancy of master transcription factors, chromatin regulators, or chromatin marks, while stretch enhancers are large chromatin-defined regulatory regions of at least 3,000 base pairs. Several studies have characterized these regulatory regions in numerous cell types and tissues to decipher their functional importance. However, the differences and similarities between these regulatory regions have not been fully assessed. We integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from ten human cell types to perform a comparative analysis of super and stretch enhancers with respect to their chromatin profiles, cell type-specificity, and ability to control gene expression. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome, and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex, and more transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes. These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers."

Globally, an estimated 107,000 people die annually from lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, and asbestosis due to occupational asbestos exposure. Malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer are caused by all major types of asbestos. Asbestos causes more lung cancer deaths than malignant mesothelioma of the pleura; most cases of the latter are due to asbestos exposure. The cancer risk increases with cumulative asbestos exposure, with increased risk even at low levels of exposure to asbestos. Based on empirical studies, an estimated cumulative occupational exposure to asbestos of 1 fiber/mL-year substantially raises malignant mesothelioma risk. No safe threshold for asbestos exposure has been established for lung cancer and mesothelioma. The validity of fiber-type risk assessments depends critically on the quality of exposure assessments, which vary considerably, leading to a high degree of uncertainty. Asbestos exposure without asbestosis and smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. The joint effect of asbestos and smoking is supra-additive, which may depend in part on the presence of asbestosis. Asbestos workers who cease smoking experience a dramatic drop in lung cancer risk, which approaches that of nonsmokers after 30 years. Studies to date show that longer, thinner fibers have a stronger association with lung cancer than shorter, less thin fibers, but the latter nonetheless also show an association with lung cancer and mesothelioma. Low-dose chest computed tomographic scanning offers an unprecedented opportunity to detect early-stage lung cancers in asbestos-exposed workers. "

Short RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) interact with each other with reciprocal consequences for their fates and functions. LncRNAs serve as precursors for many types of small RNAs and, therefore, the pathways for small RNA biogenesis can impinge upon the fate of lncRNAs. In addition, lncRNA expression can be repressed by small RNAs, and lncRNAs can affect small RNA activity and abundance through competition for binding or by triggering small RNA degradation.

To address a role of secreted exosomes in neuronal homeostasis in AD, we harvested exosomes from the conditioned medium of HEK293-APP Swe/Ind cells. We have demonstrated that these exosomes contained APP and were capable of efficiently transferring APP to normal primary neurons. Moreover, these exosomes had dose-dependent detrimental effect on cultured neurons.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SATB1 overexpression and its correlation with poor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM (tumor, nodes, metastases) stage and prognosis have been demonstrated. However, more detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways. Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, \u03b2-catenin and MMP7 indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1. Taken together, this suggests a more complex molecular interplay between tumor-promoting and possible inhibitory effects in CRC by affecting multiple pathways and molecules involved in proliferation, cell cycle, EMT, invasion and cell survival.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and, subsequently, the effect of metformin in regressing angiotensin II (Ang-II)-mediated atheromatous plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice. AMPK activity was dose and time dependently downregulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which was accompanied by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Of note, AMPK activators metformin and AICAR significantly attenuated PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production. However, inhibition of AMPK activity alone by compound C was ineffective in promoting monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in the absence of PMA. On the other hand, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity inhibited PMA-induced inflammation but not differentiation, suggesting that inflammation and differentiation are independent events. In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 activity inhibited both inflammation and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. By decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, metformin and AICAR through increased AMPK activation caused inhibition of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Metformin attenuated Ang-II-induced atheromatous plaque formation and aortic aneurysm in ApoE(-/-) mice partly by reducing monocyte infiltration. We conclude that the AMPK-STAT3 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and that by decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation through increased AMPK activity, AMPK activators inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation."

Classically, poliosis is known to occur in the setting of several genetic syndromes including piebaldism, Waardenburg, and tuberous sclerosis. In addition, poliosis has been described in association with various acquired conditions. These include inflammatory conditions, benign and malignant neoplastic entities that are mainly melanocytic, medications, and others. In this review, we aim to describe the different conditions where poliosis may be encountered, with the aim of helping the clinician to better evaluate any patient presenting with poliosis. "

SATB1 expression profile coincides with T lineage commitment and upregulation of SATB1 correlates with positive selection of thymocytes. CD4 thymocytes exhibit a characteristic bimodal expression pattern that corresponds to immature and mature CD4 thymocytes. We also demonstrate that GATA3, the key transcriptional regulator of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells positively regulates SATB1 expression in thymocytes suggesting an important role for SATB1 during T cell development."

Increased Src activity has been reported in many types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer."

Interacting partners BCL11B and GATAD2A are also schizophrenia risk genes indicating that other genes interacting with or are regulated by SATB2 are making a contribution to schizophrenia and cognition. We used data from Satb2 mouse models to generate three gene-sets that contain genes either functionally related to SATB2 or targeted by SATB2 at different stages of development. Each was tested for enrichment using the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets for schizophrenia and educational attainment (EA) and enrichment analysis was also performed for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders using data from rare variant sequencing studies. These SATB2 gene-sets were enriched for genes containing common variants associated with schizophrenia and EA, and were enriched for genes containing rare variants reported in studies of schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. In the developing cortex, genes targeted by SATB2 based on ChIP-seq data, and functionally affected when SATB2 is not expressed based on differential expression analysis using RNA-seq data, show strong enrichment for genes associated with EA. For genes expressed in the hippocampus or at the synapse, those targeted by SATB2 are more strongly enriched for genes associated EA than gene-sets not targeted by SATB2. This study demonstrates that single gene findings from GWAS can provide important insights to pathobiological processes. In this case we find evidence that genes influenced by SATB2 and involved in synaptic transmission, axon guidance and formation of the corpus callosum are contributing to schizophrenia and cognition."

The number of power plant employees and first responders with acute radiation syndrome under follow-up by the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine decreased from 179 in 1986-1991 to 105 in 2011-2015. Cancers and leukemia (19) and cardiovascular diseases (21) were the main causes of deaths among acute radiation syndrome survivors (54) during the postaccident period. Increased radiation risks of leukemia in the Ukrainian cohort of 110,645 cleanup workers exposed to low doses are comparable to those among survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945. Additionally, an excess of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was demonstrated in the cleanup workers cohort for 26 y after the exposure. A significant excess of multiple myeloma incidence [standardized incidence rate (SIR) 1.61 %, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.21], thyroid cancer (SIR 4.18, 95% CI 3.76-4.59), female breast cancer (SIR 1.57 CI 1.40-1.73), and all cancers combined (SIR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09) was registered. High prevalence was demonstrated for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and mental health changes. However, the reasons for the increases require further investigation. To monitor other possible late effects of radiation exposure in Chornobyl cleanup workers, analytical cohort and case-control studies need to include cardiovascular pathology, specifically types of potentially radiogenic cancers using a molecular epidemiology approach. Possible effects for further study include increased rates of thyroid, breast, and lung cancers and multiple myeloma; reduction of radiation risks of leukemia to population levels; and increased morbidity and mortality of cleanup workers from cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology."

Previously we have revealed a five-helix structure of the N-terminal CUT domain, which is essentially the folded region in the MAR-binding domain, of human SATB1 by NMR. Here we determined crystal structure of the complex of the CUT domain and a MAR DNA, in which the third helix of the CUT domain deeply enters the major groove of DNA in the B-form. Bases of 5'-CTAATA-3' sequence are contacted by this helix, through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds and apolar and van der Waals contacts. Mutations at conserved base-contacting residues, Gln402 and Gly403, reduced the DNA-binding activity, which confirmed the importance of the observed interactions involving these residues. A significant number of equivalent contacts are observed also for typically four-helix POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins, indicating that these domains share a common framework of the DNA-binding mode, recognizing partially similar DNA sequences."

Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous alleles of MAE genes have elevated average population frequencies. We also observed strong enrichment of the MAE signature among genes reported to evolve under balancing selection. We propose that an important biological function of widespread MAE might be the generation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; the increased genetic variation contributes to this heterogeneity. "

An intensified insulin regimen is often unsuccessful, while other therapeutic options, such as amylin analog injections, use of continuous glucose sensors, and islet or pancreas transplantation are of limited clinical use. In efforts to provide patients with a more compliable treatment method, Oramed Pharmaceuticals tested the capacity of its oral insulin capsule (ORMD-0801, 8 mg insulin) in addressing this resistant clinical state. Eight Type I diabetes patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c: 7.5-10%) were monitored throughout the 15-day study period by means of a blind continuous glucose monitoring device. Baseline patient blood glucose behavior was monitored and recorded over a five-day pretreatment screening period. During the ensuing ten-day treatment phase, patients were asked to conduct themselves as usual and to self-administer an oral insulin capsule three times daily, just prior to meal intake. CGM data sufficient for pharmacodynamics analyses were obtained from 6 of the 8 subjects. Treatment with ORMD-0801 was associated with a significant 24.4% reduction in the frequencies of glucose readings >200 mg/dL (60.1 \u00b1 7.9% pretreatment vs. 45.4 \u00b1 4.9% during ORMD-0801 treatment; p\u200a=\u200a0.023) and a significant mean 16.6% decrease in glucose area under the curve (AUC) (66055 \u00b1 5547 mg/dL/24 hours vs. 55060 \u00b1 3068 mg/dL/24 hours, p\u200a=\u200a0.023), with a greater decrease during the early evening hours. In conclusion, ORMD-0801 oral insulin capsules in conjunction with subcutaneous insulin injections, well tolerated and effectively reduced glycemia throughout the day."

These findings have spurred several human clinical trials to prevent AKI. However, no specific therapy effectively treats clinically obvious AKI or rescues renal function once advanced injury is established. We investigated if noninvasive image-guided pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) could alter the kidney microenvironment to enhance homing of subsequently infused MSC. To examine the efficacy of pFUS-enhanced cell homing in disease, we targeted pFUS to kidneys to enhance MSC homing after cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that pFUS enhanced MSC homing at 1 day post-cisplatin, prior to renal functional deficits, and that enhanced homing improved outcomes of renal function, tubular cell death, and regeneration at 5 days post-cisplatin compared to MSC alone. We then investigated whether pFUS+MSC therapy could rescue established AKI. MSC alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits were obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved by pFUS and MSC. pFUS prior to MSC injections increased IL-10 production by MSC that homed to kidneys and generated an anti-inflammatory immune cell profile in treated kidneys. This study shows pFUS is a neoadjuvant approach to improve MSC homing to diseased organs. pFUS with MSC better prevents AKI than MSC alone and allows rescue therapy in established AKI, which currently has no meaningful therapeutic options."

Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life."

Permanent MCAO results in a modest neutrophil infiltration at 24 h after ischaemia, predominantly around arterial vessels at the margins of infarction, whereas MCAO with subsequent reperfusion is associated with substantial infiltration by neutrophils throughout the entire infarct. Several studies show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events. Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol. Various cytokines were shown to be expressed in the injured brain. Recent investigations demonstrated that mRNAs of above cytokines were induced in the ischemic rat brain. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates key roles in many physiological and pathological cellular processes including acute and chronic inflammation, programmed cell death or apoptosis, anti-tumor responses, and infection. Pharmaceutical industry to search a small molecule TNF inhibitor have taken multiple strategies. Significant protection after in vivo oral use of SB-239063 from brain injury and neurological deficits was observed in one study. In the same study significant protection from brain injury and neurological deficits was also demonstrated due to i.v post-stroke treatment with the same compound. Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion process consists of several steps, beginning with rolling of the leukocyte on the endothelial surface until it has slowed down to such a degree that it sticks to the endothelium. Treatment with a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) has been investigated in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial (EAST). Unfortunately, the case fatality rate in this trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, experimental data have shown that focal cerebral ischemia induces a time-dependent activation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Dissipation of ATP by CD39 reduced P2X7 receptor stimulation and thereby suppressed baseline leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin expression. As alphaMbeta2-integrin blockade reversed the postischemic, inflammatory phenotype of Cd39-/- mice, these data suggest that phosphohydrolytic activity on the leukocyte surface suppresses cell-cell interactions that would otherwise promote thrombosis or inflammation."

Although GRHL2 recently has attracted considerable interest in that it could be identified as a novel suppressor of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, evidence is emerging that GRHL2 also exhibits tumour-promoting activities. Aim of the present study therefore was to help defining the relevance of GRHL2 for human cancers by performing a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in normal (n = 608) and (n = 3,143) tumour tissues using tissue microarrays. Consistent with its accepted role in epithelial morphogenesis, GRHL2 expression preferentially but not exclusively was observed in epithelial cells. Regenerative and proliferating epithelial cells with stem cell features showed a strong GRHL2 expression. Highly complex GRHL2 expression patterns indicative of both reduced and elevated GRHL2 expression in tumours, possibly reflecting potential tumour-suppressing as well as oncogenic functions of GRHL2 in distinct human tumours, were observed. A dysregulation of GRHL2 expression for the first time was found in tumours of non-epithelial origin (e.g., astrocytomas, melanomas). We also report GRHL2 copy number gains which, however, did not necessarily translate into increased GRHL2 expression levels in cancer cells. Results obtained by meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data in conjunction with functional assays demonstrating a direct regulation of HER3 expression further point to a potential therapeutic relevance of GRHL2 in ovarian cancer. Hopefully, the results presented in this study may pave the way for a better understanding of the yet largely unknown function of GRHL2 in the initiation, progression and also therapy of cancers. "

Factors including the secretion of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin, as well as autotaxin, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and hepatic growth factor, metabolic remodeling that supports the growth of breast cancer by transfer of fatty acids to increase mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation, extracellular matrix remodeling and endotrophin production from type IV collagen, and cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype changes have all been implicated in this comprehensive process. Moreover, adipocytes may act as obstacles to therapy, as they are involved in mechanisms of resistance against various breast cancer treatments. Adipose tissues may also be a reservoir for dormant tumor cells during postsurgical autologous fat grafting. Thus, adipocytes, and the processes and pathways in which they are involved, could be effective therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

Recent Advances: Activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis reduces hypertension and improves vascular injury mainly through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies reported that shedding of the enzymatically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell surface seems to regulate its activity and serves as an interorgan communicator in cardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no catalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism."

The product was no longer available to the market after less than two years from its approval triggering a setback for competitive new inhalable insulins that were already in various clinical development phases. In contrary, MannKind Corporation started developing its ultra-rapid-acting insulin Afrezza in a bold bid, probably by managing the issues in which Exubera was not successful.

We constructed the corresponding green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and studied their intracellular localization in COS-1 cells. We showed that 28 amino acids in the amino terminus of PPOX contain an independently functioning signal for mitochondrial targeting. The experiments with amino-terminally truncated green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed that amino acids 25-477 of PPOX contained an additional mitochondrial targeting signal(s). We constructed a structural model for the interaction between the amino-terminal end of PPOX and the putative mitochondrial receptor protein Tom20. The model suggests that leucine and isoleucine residues Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15 forming an alpha-helical hydrophobic motif, LXXXIXXL, were crucial for the recognition of the targeting signal. The validity of the model was tested using mutants L8Q, I12T, and L15Q disrupting the hydrophobic surface of the LXXXIXXL helix. The results from in vitro expression studies and molecular modeling were in accordance supporting the hypothesis that the recognition of the mitochondrial targeting signal is dependent on hydrophobic interactions between the targeting signal and the mitochondrial receptor."

Autoimmunity was fully dependent on Btk kinase activity, because Btk inhibitor treatment (PCI-32765) could normalize B-cell activation and differentiation, and because autoantibodies were absent in Btk transgenic mice overexpressing a kinase inactive Btk mutant. B cells overexpressing wild-type Btk were selectively hyperresponsive to BCR stimulation and showed enhanced Ca(2+) influx, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation, resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis, and defective elimination of selfreactive B cells in vivo. These findings unravel a crucial role for Btk in setting the threshold for B-cell activation and counterselection of autoreactive B cells, making Btk an attractive therapeutic target in systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE. The finding of in vivo pathology associated with Btk overexpression may have important implications for the development of gene therapy strategies for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, the immunodeficiency associated with mutations in BTK."

The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7 variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant, c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7 variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7 variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific effect of this X-chromosomal variation."

Herein, we propose as a therapeutic for PD the small molecule 17-beta-spiro-[5-androsten-17,2'-oxiran]-3beta-ol (BNN-20), a synthetic analogue of DHEA, which crosses the BBB and is deprived of endocrine side-effects. Using the \"weaver\" mouse, a genetic model of PD, which exhibits progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra (SN), we have shown that long-term administration (P1-P21) of BNN-20 almost fully protected the dopaminergic neurons and their terminals, via i) a strong anti-apoptotic effect, probably mediated through the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) neurotrophin receptor's PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ii) by exerting an efficient antioxidant effect, iii) by inducing significant anti-inflammatory activity and iv) by restoring Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels. By intercrossing \"weaver\" with NGL mice (dual GFP/luciferase-NF-\u03ba\u0392 reporter mice, NF-\u03ba\u0392.GFP.Luc), we obtained Weaver/NGL mice that express the NF-\u03baB reporter in all somatic cells. Acute BNN-20 administration to Weaver/NGL mice induced a strong NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response in the brain as detected by bioluminescence imaging, which was abolished by co-administration of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. This indicates that BNN-20 exerts its beneficial action (at least in part) through the TrkB-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results could be of clinical relevance, as they suggest BNN-20 as an important neuroprotective agent acting through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor pathway, mimicking the action of the endogenous neurotrophin BDNF. Thus BNN-20 could be proposed for treatment of PD."

From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample. MRPL53 (2p13.1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis. Our study illustrates not only the importance of sampling admixed populations but also the relevance of measuring the functional effects of genetic variants over gene expression to dissect the complexity of disease phenotypes."

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients ("

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg) antagonized delay-dependent deficits in the NOT in the normal rat, suggesting that this DHEA derivative affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. In addition, BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the scopolamine [0.2mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)]-induced non-spatial and spatial recognition memory deficits.

The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture."

Using a microarray, we identified decreased expression of mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) lysine methyl transferase at 1 and 3 days of post-common bile duct ligation (CBDL) in mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) analysis revealed that H3K4me3 of transporter promoters by MLL3 as part of activating signal cointegrator-2 -containing complex (ASCOM) is essential for activation of bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) genes by FXR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) or MLL3/MLL4 mRNAs by small interfering RNA treatment led to a decrease in BSEP and NTCP mRNA levels in hepatoma cells. Human BSEP promoter transactivation by FXR/RXR was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by NCOA6 cDNA coexpression and decreased by AdsiNCOA6 infection in HepG2 cells. GST-pull down assays showed that domain 3 and 5 of NCOA6 (LXXLL motifs) interacted with FXR and that the interaction with domain 5 was enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. In vivo ChIP assays in HepG2 cells revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM complex to FXR element in BSEP and GR element in NTCP promoters, respectively. ChIP analysis demonstrated significantly diminished recruitment of ASCOM complex components and H3K4me3 to Bsep and Mrp2 promoter FXR elements in mouse livers after CBDL. Taken together, these data show that the \"H3K4me3\" epigenetic mark is essential to activation of BSEP, NTCP, and MRP2 genes by nuclear receptors and is downregulated in cholestasis."

Not all lung cancers express the MMPs believed to be most important in promoting the neoplastic process, and there are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of MMPs in lung cancer. However, it is possible that these observations are because of limitations in the procedures for measuring MMPs. Many investigators believe that MMPs are universally involved in tumor progression; this hypothesis was the basis for initiating seven phase III MMPI trials in lung cancer. Four studies were closed at completion of the predefined accrual goal, and three were closed early. There were no significant differences in survival in a non-small cell lung cancer prinomastat study, and in a small cell lung cancer marimastat trial.

However, there are several limitations with OIT and EPIT, such as allergic side effects, daily dosing requirements, and the infrequent outcome of long-term tolerance. Next-generation therapies for peanut allergy should aim to overcome these limitations, which may be achievable with adjuvanted immunotherapy. An adjuvant can be defined as anything that enhances, accelerates, or modifies an immune response to a particular antigen. Adjuvants may allow for lower doses of antigen to be given leading to decreased side effects; may only need to be administered every few weeks or months rather than daily exposures; and may induce a long-lasting protective effect.

Finding the presence of noncaseating granulomas in bioptic material is not always indicative of SA. The main point of SA's diagnosis is the level of its activity, because only patients in the active stage should be qualified for treatment. In therapy, glucocorticosteroids or second-line drugs - methotrexate or azathioprine are still recommended. Introduced monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, etanercept, adaluimumab, golimumab, rituximab), tested for efficacy in other pathologies associated with the formation of granulomas, have a limited application in patients with SA. In contrast, anti-fibrotics (pirfenidone and nintedanib) are in clinical trials. The latest method of controlling the fibrosis of the parenchyma in the course of SA is the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from umbilical cord blood. Preliminary results indicate a real possibility of using this therapy in patients with SA."

However, uncontrolled inflammation could be detrimental to the host, resulting in inflammatory disease, such as inflammatory lung disease. Although the etiology of the disease is well defined, the underling pathogenesis is still incompletely understood. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), one of the primary cardiovascular regulatory systems, has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease. In particular, the RAS has been implicated as advances in the understanding of the multifunctionality of individual components of the system have been made, and by the fact that the RAS acts not only systemically, but also locally in a variety of tissues, including the lung. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a relatively new member of the RAS, has drawn extensive attention since 2003, because of the findings that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS Corona virus and that maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung is beneficial for the host to combat inflammatory lung disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism through which ACE2 plays a role in inflammatory lung disease has not been clearly identified. In an attempt to summarize current literature findings and progress made in uncovering the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease, this review will focus on recent studies examining pulmonary ACE2 biology, its roles in inflammatory lung disease pathogenesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Finally, we will discuss pulmonary ACE2 as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory lung disease."

However, a recent study found that one-third of FIPV isolates have an intact 3c and suggested that it is not solely involved in FIP but is essential for intestinal replication. In order to confirm these assumptions, 27 fecal and 32 FIP coronavirus isolates were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during 2008-2009 and their 3a-c, E, and M genes sequenced. Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication. Although FIPVs with an intact 3c were shed in the feces following oronasal inoculation, fecal virus from these cats was not infectious for other cats. Attempts to identify potential FIP mutations in the 3a, 3b, E, and M were negative. However, the 3c gene of FIPVs, even though appearing intact, contained many more non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3' one-third of the 3c protein than FECVs. An attempt to trace FIPV isolates back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens originated, housing conditions prior to acquisition, and rapid movement through the shelter. No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that FIPVs and FECVs are genetically distinct."

Here, we show that the ASE physically interacts with the distant Rag1 and Rag2 gene promoters in DP thymocytes, bringing the two promoters together to form an active chromatin hub. Moreover, we show that the ASE functions as a classical enhancer that can potently activate these promoters in the absence of the silencer or other locus elements. In thymocytes lacking the chromatin organizer SATB1, we identified a partial defect in Tcra gene rearrangement that was associated with reduced expression of Rag1 and Rag2 at the DP stage. SATB1 binds to the ASE and Rag promoters, facilitating inclusion of Rag2 in the chromatin hub and the loading of RNA polymerase II to both the Rag1 and Rag2 promoters. Our results provide a novel framework for understanding ASE function and demonstrate a novel role for SATB1 as a regulator of Rag locus organization and gene expression in DP thymocytes."

However, it is unclear whether there also exist inter-nucleosomal communications among epigenetic modifications at single nucleosome level, and if so, what functional roles they play. Meanwhile, how clear nucleosome patterns, such as nucleosome phasing and depletion, are formed at functional regions remains an intriguing enigma. To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS. Our study revealed inter-nucleosomal communications as important players in signal propagation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation."

Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration, contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity. Comparing MM cells to other, Bortezomib-resistant, cancer cells shows that the degree of proteasome inhibition is the greatest in MM cells and only there leads to proteasome stress, providing an explanation for why Bortezomib is effective against MM but not other cancers.

The ability to study the structure-activity relationships of single and double-strand break repair, lethality, and mutagenesis in vivo is complicated by the numerous types and sites of DNA cleavage products that can be induced by such agents. The ability to \"cage\" such breaks in DNA might help to further such studies and additionally afford a mechanism for activating and deactivating nucleic acid based drugs and probes. The major type of single strand break induced by ionizing radiation is a 3'- and 5'-phosphate terminated single nucleotide gap. Previously, a caged strand break of this type had been developed that was designed to produce the 5'-phosphate directly upon irradiation with 366 nm light, and the 3'-phosphate by a subsequent beta-elimination reaction [Ordoukhanian, P., and Taylor, J.-S. (1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 9570]. Unfortunately, the release of the 3'-phosphate group was quite slow at pH 7. To circumvent this problem, a second caged strand break has been developed that produces the 3'-phosphate directly upon irradiation, and the 5'-phosphate by a subsequent beta-elimination reaction. When this caged strand break was used in tandem with the previous caged strand break, 5'- and 3'-phosphate terminated gaps could be directly produced by irradiation with 366 nm light. These caged single strand breaks were also incorporated in tandem into hairpin substrates to demonstrate that they could be used to cage double strand breaks. These caged single strand breaks should be generally useful for generating site-specific DNA single and double strand breaks and gaps, using wavelengths and doses of light that are nondetrimental to biological systems. Because the position of the single strand break can be varied, it should now be possible to examine the effect of the sequence context and cleavage pattern of single and double strand breaks on the lethality and mutagenicity of this important class of DNA damage."

We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study.

The current study evaluates the specificity of Cyp1a1 induction as a marker for AhR affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of AhR activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of Cyp1a1 and other AhR-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the AhR using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo Cyp1a1 mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for AhR activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce Cyp1a1 in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the AhR in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine AhR agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and nimodipine. These drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans. These data demonstrate that induction of Cyp1a1 is a nonspecific biomarker of direct AhR affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that Cyp1a1 induction and/or AhR activation is not synonymous with dioxin-like toxicity."

We report here H2A.Z-chaperone activity of the yeast FACT complex on the short, nucleosome-free, non-coding, pol III-transcribed yeast tRNA genes. On a prototype gene, yeast SUP4, chromatin remodeler RSC and FACT regulate its transcription through novel mechanisms, wherein the two gene-flanking nucleosomes containing H2A.Z, play different roles. Nhp6, which ensures transcription fidelity and helps load yFACT onto the gene flanking nucleosomes, has inhibitory role. RSC maintains a nucleosome abutting the gene terminator downstream, which results in reduced transcription rate in active state while H2A.Z probably helps RSC in keeping the gene nucleosome-free and serves as stress-sensor. All these factors maintain an epigenetic state which allows the gene to return quickly from repressed to active state and tones down the expression from the active SUP4 gene, required probably to maintain the balance in cellular tRNA pool."

Conditions resulting in cellular stress such as starvation or hypoxia might activate autophagy. Being at the crossroads of various cellular response pathways, dysregulation of autophagy might result in pathological states including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy has also been shown to participate in stemness. MicroRNAs were introduced as novel regulators of autophagy, and accumulating results underlined the fact that they constituted an important layer of biological control mechanism on the autophagic activity.MicroRNAs are protein noncoding small RNAs that control cellular levels of transcripts and proteins through posttrancriptional mechanisms. Novel miRNAs in human and mouse genomes are yet to be identified. Considering the emerging role of autophagy in health and disease, identification of novel autophagy-regulating miRNAs and determination of relations between miRNA expression and physiological and pathological conditions might contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms governing health and disease. High-throughput techniques were developed for miRNA profiling, yet for a thorough characterization and miRNA target determination, miRNA cloning remains as an important step. Here, we describe a modified miRNA cloning method for the characterization of novel autophagy-regulating miRNAs."

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution."

Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting investigations revealed the presence of cathepsin L in the nuclear compartment in addition to its expected endo-lysosomal localization in colorectal carcinoma cells. Cathepsin L was represented as the full-length protein in the nuclei of HCT116 cells from which stefin B, a potent cathepsin L inhibitor, was absent. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses with synchronized cell cultures revealed deceleration of cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells upon inhibition of cathepsin L activity, while expression of cathepsin L-enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras accelerated S-phase entry. We conclude that the activity of cathepsin L is high in the nucleus of colorectal carcinoma cells because of lacking stefin B inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we hypothesize that nuclear cathepsin L accelerates cell cycle progression of HCT116 cells thereby supporting the notion that cysteine cathepsins may play significant roles in carcinogenesis due to deregulated trafficking.

The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents."

The final model (with identified covariates) was used to simulate steady-state exposure for patients with impaired renal function. Results from forest plots reveal that patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease are associated with significantly higher Cssmax and AUC compared to patients with normal renal function.
