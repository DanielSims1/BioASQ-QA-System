Ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum are human hereditary diseases in which patients are cancer prone and demonstrate increased sensitivity to DNA damage by ionizing and ultraviolet radiation, respectively. In culture, both ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum skin fibroblasts show increased synthesis and secretion of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen. To determine whether these differences in protein production result from fundamental abnormalities in regulation of genes associated with cellular interactions, we compared the effects of trifluoperazine and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on expression of the extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, procollagenase and prostromelysin, by normal, ataxia-telangiectasia, and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. After trifluoperazine treatment the overall levels of these metalloproteinases were much greater in three ataxia-telangiectasia cell strains and in cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A and D than in normal cells. In contrast, cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C produced only slightly more procollagenase than normal cells. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also induced higher than normal levels of procollagenase in some ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum strains, but less than that induced by trifluoperazine. Because increased extracellular accumulation of matrix-degrading enzymes has long been implicated in metastatic progression, this altered expression of procollagenase and prostromelysin in ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum cells could play an important role in the pathogenesis of various tumors in individuals with these genetic diseases."

In 1168, the first silver was found in the Saxon Erzgebirge. Mining began shortly thereafter and continues to this day at varying intensities. About 250 miners are permanently engaged in rehabilitation work at old mining sites so that houses and roads are safe and the mine water can drain through galleries. The radon potential in the Erzgebirge is high. Despite radiation protection measures, exposures to more than 6 mSv occurred among 22 miners in 2016 alone. For this reason, the miners are monitored with personal radon dosimetry. The dosimeters consist of diffusion chambers with CR-39 nuclear track detectors. Outside the miners' working hours, the dosimeters must be stored together with a reference dosimeter. After a 3 mo wearing period, the dosimeters are replaced and the miners' exposures are determined. For this purpose, the exposures of the reference dosimeters that have occurred outside working hours are subtracted from the exposures of the miners' dosimeters. In mining practices, this method has caused problems. The conditions of use (storing dosimeters along with a reference dosimeter) were often not met by the miners. To solve the problems, reference dosimeters were replaced by radonproof boxes with activated carbon cartridges inside. The miners stored their dosimeters in the boxes outside working hours. A uniform reference value for the radon activity concentration of 50 Bq m was used for all boxes to determine the exposure of miners during working hours. The associated error was small. In future, reference dosimeters and the measurement of a reference value will not be necessary."

They display a wide variety of complex and beautiful shapes, most of which have evolved for a particular physiological reason and are adapted to accommodate certain cellular demands. In membrane trafficking events, the dynamic remodelling of cellular membranes is apparent. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis for example, the plasma membrane undergoes heavy deformation to generate and internalize a highly curved clathrin-coated vesicle. This process has become a model system to study proteins with the ability to sense and induce membrane curvature and over the last two decades numerous membrane remodelling molecules and molecular mechanisms have been identified in this process. In this review, we discuss the interaction of epsin1 ENTH domain with membranes, which is one of the best-studied examples of a peripheral and transiently membrane bending protein important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis."

Characterizing cellular responses to different extrinsic signals is an active area of research, and curated pathway databases describe these complex signaling reactions. Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules \"connected\" in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, B-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. B-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathway's downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as B-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways with statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset. STRING interactions whose proteins are B-connected in Reactome have statistically significantly higher scores than interactions connected in the bipartite graph representation. Our method lays the groundwork for other generalizations of graph-theoretic concepts to hypergraphs in order to facilitate signaling pathway analysis."
