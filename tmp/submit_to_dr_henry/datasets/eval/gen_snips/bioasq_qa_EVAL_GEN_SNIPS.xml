one of the alleles at rs1051644 (average minor allele frequency: 0.45) located in the 3' untranslated region of the gene.Moreover, our results have a broad translational value extending to several pathological conditions linked to gene-gain in copy number variations.Allele-specific silencing as treatment for gene duplication disorders: proof-of-principle in autosomal dominant

positioning.We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease.These mice showed severe vacuolar degeneration of the spinal cord white matter together with marked astrogliosis, microglial infiltration, and secondary axonal damage.Chromatin changes were accompanied by reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis pathways, many of which are known to play important roles in myelin regulation and are preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes.Decreased lipogenic gene expression resulted in a significant reduction in multiple classes of lipids involved in myelin formation.Many of these gene expression changes and lipid alterations were observed even before the onset of the phenotype, suggesting a causal role.These results have implications for disease pathogenesis and may also shed light on the regulation of lipid synthesis pathways in myelin maintenance and turnover.We

The suitability of adult male the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) for Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been reported for both high energy gamma (&gt;1 MeV) and low energy x-ray (90 keV) sterilization. However, research regarding sterilization of NOW larvae and pupae by gamma irradiation indicated nonsuitability due to high mortality. Here, NOW larvae and pupae were irradiated to doses up to 50 Gy with 90 keV x-rays, then paired with nonirradiated colony mates. Sterility of surviving insects was determined by the presence or absence of hatched neonates. While presence of offspring does not guarantee viability, the absence does guarantee sterility (as is appropriate for SIT) and was thus the measure used here. Early stage larvae experienced 77% mortality at a dose of 30 Gy, versus 20% for nonirradiated control. At 40 Gy, mortality reached 98%. Of surviving early stage larvae at 30 Gy, 29% of moth pairs produced offspring. For late stage larvae, no offspring were produced at 40 Gy, but mortality was 73%. For pupae, mortality reached 53% at 30 Gy with 13% still producing neonates, while mortality reached 98% at 40 Gy. These results are consistent with reported results for gamma irradiation of NOW larvae where sterility was observed somewhere between the 30 Gy and 60 Gy data points, but mortality was high. This further confirms the lack of suitability of NOW irradiated in the larval stage, whether by gamma or x-ray, and supports the hypothesis that x-ray and gamma treatments are biologically equivalent at equal doses.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>gamma sterilization</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32067198"><Journal>Cell and tissue banking</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Investigation of the mechanism of gamma irradiation effect on bovine bone.</Title><Abstract>Investigation of the mechanism of gamma irradiation effect on bovine bone. Radiation sterilization is an effective method of bone sterilization prior to bone graft transplantation. Gamma irradiation affects the biological and mechanical properties of bone; depending on the dose of radiation. The effect of gamma irradiation on bone mechanical properties is an unwanted phenomenon. However the mechanism of the effect of irradiation on bone mechanical properties is not properly understood. In this research paper the mechanism of the effect of gamma irradiation on bovine bone is investigated using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-rays spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Gamma irradiation affects the mineral and fiber composition of bovine bone. The mineral content of bone especially calcium, magnesium and phosphorus decrease with increasing dose of gamma radiation. At Nano-level gamma irradiation alter amide I, amide II and amide III collagen contents. High dose gamma irradiation induces collagen cross-linking reaction in bone and degrades bone properties.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

cycles compared to 30-35 of other methods).Cloning of complete genome sets of six dsRNA viruses using an improved cloning method for large dsRNA genes.Cloning full-length large (&gt;3 kb) dsRNA genome segments from small amounts of dsRNA has thus far remained problematic.Here, a single-primer amplification sequence-independent dsRNA cloning procedure was perfected for large genes and tailored for routine use to clone complete genome sets or individual genes.Nine complete viral genome sets were amplified by PCR, namely those of two human rotaviruses, two African horsesickness viruses (AHSV), two equine encephalosis viruses (EEV), one bluetongue virus (BTV), one reovirus and bacteriophage Phi12.Of these amplified genomes, six complete genome sets were cloned for viruses with genes ranging in size from 0.8 to 6.8 kb.To clone complete genome sets, one-tube reactions were developed for oligo-ligation, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification.Complete genomes can be cloned from as little as 1 ng dsRNA and a considerably reduced number of PCR cycles (22-30 cycles compared to 30-35 of other methods).This progress with cloning large dsRNA genes is important for recombinant vaccine development and determination of the role of terminal sequences for replication and gene expression.This work presents the first EEV sequence data and establishes that EEV genes have the same conserved termini (5' GUU and UAC 3') and coding assignment as AHSV and BTV.</Abstract><MeSH>African Horse Sickness Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Cloning, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Cystoviridae</MeSH><MeSH>DNA,

Ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum are human hereditary diseases in which patients are cancer prone and demonstrate increased sensitivity to DNA damage by ionizing and ultraviolet radiation, respectively. In culture, both ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum skin fibroblasts show increased synthesis and secretion of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen. To determine whether these differences in protein production result from fundamental abnormalities in regulation of genes associated with cellular interactions, we compared the effects of trifluoperazine and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on expression of the extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, procollagenase and prostromelysin, by normal, ataxia-telangiectasia, and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. After trifluoperazine treatment the overall levels of these metalloproteinases were much greater in three ataxia-telangiectasia cell strains and in cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A and D than in normal cells. In contrast, cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C produced only slightly more procollagenase than normal cells. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also induced higher than normal levels of procollagenase in some ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum strains, but less than that induced by trifluoperazine. Because increased extracellular accumulation of matrix-degrading enzymes has long been implicated in metastatic progression, this altered expression of procollagenase and prostromelysin in ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum cells could play an important role in the pathogenesis of various tumors in individuals with these genetic diseases.</Abstract><MeSH>Ataxia Telangiectasia</MeSH><MeSH>Collagenases</MeSH><MeSH>Enzyme Precursors</MeSH><MeSH>Fibroblasts</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Microbial Collagenase</MeSH><MeSH>Skin</MeSH><MeSH>Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate</MeSH><MeSH>Trifluoperazine</MeSH><MeSH>Xeroderma Pigmentosum</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32047639"><Journal>Human genome variation</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>A novel nonsense mutation of </Title><Abstract>A novel nonsense mutation of  Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group D, a severe disease often typified by extreme sun sensitivity, can be caused by </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32047639"><Journal>Human genome variation</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>A novel nonsense mutation of </Title><Abstract>A novel nonsense mutation of  Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group D, a severe disease often typified by extreme sun sensitivity, can be caused by </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="7963692"><Journal>The Journal of investigative dermatology</Journal><Year>1994</Year><Title>Xeroderma pigmentosum and related disorders: examining the linkage between defective DNA repair and cancer.</Title><Abstract>Xeroderma pigmentosum and related disorders: examining the linkage between defective DNA repair and cancer. Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, the xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex, and trichothiodystrophy cells have defects in DNA repair and are associated with clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UV). Familial dysplastic nevus syndrome cells have UV hypermutability. Although xeroderma pigmentosum and dysplastic nevus syndrome have markedly increased cancer risk. Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy do not. At the molecular level, these disorders are associated with several different genetic defects as evidenced by the existence of multiple overlapping complementation groups. Recent progress has been made in identifying the chromosomal location and cloning the defective genes in these disorders. Using plasmid shuttle vectors we have shown abnormal repair and mutagenesis of DNA damaged by 254-nm (UVC) or 295-nm (UVB) radiation or the chemical carcinogen aflatoxin in cells from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. Although xeroderma pigmentosum cells are defective in repair of all photoproducts, Cockayne syndrome cells appear to be defective in repair of cyclobutane dimers and have normal repair of nondimer photoproducts. DNS cells have post UV plasmid hypermutability. These diseases may serve as models for examining molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in humans.</Abstract><MeSH>Cockayne Syndrome</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Linkage</MeSH><MeSH>Hair</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Xeroderma Pigmentosum</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31503159"><Journal>Obstetrics and gynecology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Reproductive Health in Xeroderma Pigmentosum: Features of Premature Aging.</Title><Abstract>Reproductive Health in Xeroderma Pigmentosum: Features of Premature Aging.

Despite weight loss recommendations to prevent cancer, cancer outcome studies after intentional weight loss are limited. Recently, reduced cancer mortality following bariatric surgery has been reported. This study tested whether reduced cancer mortality following gastric bypass was due to decreased incidence. Cancer incidence and mortality data through 2007 from the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR) were compared between 6,596 Utah patients who had gastric bypass (1984-2002) and 9,442 severely obese persons who had applied for Utah Driver's Licenses (1984-2002). Study outcomes included incidence, case-fatality, and mortality for cancer by site and stage at diagnosis of all gastric bypass patients, compared to nonoperated severely obese controls. Follow-up was over a 24-year period (mean 12.5 years). Total cancer incidence was significantly lower in the surgical group compared to controls (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.65-0.89; P = 0.0006). Lower incidence in surgery patients vs. controls was primarily due to decreased incidence of cancer diagnosed at regional or distant stages. Cancer mortality was 46% lower in the surgery group compared to controls (HR = 0.54; CI 95%, 0.37-0.78; P = 0.001). Although the apparent protective effect of surgery on risk of developing cancer was limited to cancers likely known to be obesity related, the inverse association for mortality was seen for all cancers. Significant reduction in total cancer mortality in gastric bypass patients compared with severely obese controls was associated with decreased incidence, primarily among subjects with advanced cancers. These findings suggest gastric bypass results in lower cancer risk, presumably related to weight loss, supporting recommendations for reducing weight to lower cancer risk.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Case-Control Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gastric Bypass</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Incidence</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Obesity, Morbid</MeSH><MeSH>Proportional Hazards Models</MeSH><MeSH>Risk Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Utah</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

vulnerabilities is proposed.Firstly, the relationship between open source software vulnerability and API call sequence is studied.Then, the behavioral risk vulnerability database of open source software is proposed as a support for vulnerability detection.In addition, the CNN-IndRNN classification model is constructed by improving the Independently Recurrent Neural Net-work (IndRNN) algorithm and applies to open source software security vulnerability detection.The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed open source software security vulnerability detection

dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects and more potency compared to imatinib.However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA is poorly understood.The present study investigated the treatment effect of dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis.We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice.Dasatinib treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice.We further demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis.The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS treated with dasatinib.Our findings suggest that dasatinib

re-programming.</Title><Abstract>Although promising new therapies for this incurable disease are being tested in clinical trials, the therapeutic relevance of metabolic rewiring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is poorly understood.The contrasting metabolic features revealed by our strategy could be used to metabolically target CLL lymphocyte subsets creating new therapeutic windows for this disease for mTORC1 or AMPK inhibitors.Resistance to Dasatinib in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes involves AMPK-mediated energetic re-programming.The aim of this study was to identify targetable metabolic differences in primary CLL lymphocytes by the use of Dasatinib.Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is being tested in clinical trials for several cancers including CLL.In keeping with this previous observation, we report that Dasatinib induced glucose use while reducing lactate production, suggesting that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases aerobic glycolysis and shifts glucose use in primary CLL lymphocytes.Our results suggest that primary CLL lymphocytes (independently of traditional prognostic factors) can be stratified in two subsets by their sensitivity to Dasatinib in vitro.Increased glucose use induced by Dasatinib or by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was not sufficient to sustain survival and ATP levels in CLL samples sensitive to Dasatinib.Differential metabolic reprogramming between subsets is supported by the contrasting effect on the survival of Dasatinib treated CLL lymphocytes with pharmacological inhibition of two master metabolic regulators (mTorc1 and AMPK) as well as induced autophagy.Indeed, we report that Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes was selectively cytotoxic to Dasatinib sensitive samples.Ultimately, we suggest that a similar strategy could be applied to other cancer types by using Dasatinib and/or relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is being tested in clinical trials for several cancers including CLL.Differential

To solve the problem that traditional image registration methods based on continuous optimization for large motion lung 4D CT image sequences are easy to fall into local optimal solutions and lead to serious misregistration, a novel image registration method based on high-order Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed. By analyzing the effect of the deformation field constraint of the potential functions with different order cliques in MRF model, energy functions with high-order cliques form are designed separately for 2D and 3D images to preserve topology of the deformation field. In order to preserve the topology of the deformation field more effectively, it is necessary to apply a smooth term and a topology preservation term simultaneously in the energy function and use logarithmic function to impose a penalty on the Jacobian matrix with high-order cliques in the topology preservation term. For the complexity of the designed energy function with high-order cliques form, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem of the designed energy function. To address the high computational requirements in lung 4D CT image registration, a multi-level processing strategy is adopted to reduce the space complexity of the proposed registration method and promotes the computational efficiency.

The objective of our study was to investigate the impact of specific occupational conditions on chromosome aberration frequency and evaluate dosimeter-wearing compliance of industrial radiographers in Korea.

These conditions allow the binding of one C9 molecule per C5b-8 site.The C5b-8 site containing one C9 molecule bound a second C9 molecule at 0 degree C only after incubation at 37 degrees C. The binding of C9 to a C5b-8 site containing one C9 molecule was found to be 1.3 (+/- 0.2) nM.Therefore, the presence of a C9 molecule did not significantly alter the binding capacity of the C5b-8 site for additional C9 molecules.A similar result was obtained by using rabbit erythrocytes bearing either C5b-8 sites or C5b-8 sites containing one molecule of C9 per complex at 0 degree C. The similarity of binding characteristics for the first and second C9 molecules argues that the initial C9 molecule in the complex does not affect the binding of subsequent C9 molecules.This suggests that a unique C9 binding site that does not involve previously bound C9 molecules may exist on the forming membrane attack complex.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Complement C9</MeSH><MeSH>Complement Membrane Attack Complex</MeSH><MeSH>Complement System Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Erythrocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Escherichia coli</MeSH><MeSH>Hot Temperature</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Rabbits</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>molecule</QueryUsed><Result PMID="7966556"><Journal>Journal of virology</Journal><Year>1994</Year><Title>Incorporation of excess wild-type and mutant tRNA(3Lys) into human immunodeficiency virus type 1.</Title><Abstract>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles produced in COS-7 cells transfected with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA contain 8 molecules of tRNA(3Lys) per 2 molecules of genomic RNA and 12 molecules of tRNA1,2Lys per 2 molecules of genomic RNA.When COS-7 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing both HIV-1 proviral DNA and a human tRNA3Lys gene, there is a large increase in the amount of cytoplasmic tRNA3Lys per microgram of total cellular RNA, and the tRNA3Lys content in the virus increases from 8 to 17 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA.However, the total number of tRNALys molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA remains constant at 20; i.e., the viral tRNA1,2Lys content decreases from 12 to 3 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA.When COS-7 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing both HIV-1 proviral DNA and a mutant amber suppressor tRNA3Lys gene (in which the anticodon is changed from TTT to CTA), there is also a large increase in the relative concentration of cytoplasmic tRNA3Lys, and the tRNA3Lys content in the virus increases from 8 to 15 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA, with a decrease in viral tRNA1,2Lys from 12 to 5 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA.Thus, the total number of molecules of tRNALys in the virion remains at 20.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line</MeSH><MeSH>Chlorocebus aethiops</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Probes</MeSH><MeSH>Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional</MeSH><MeSH>Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Vectors</MeSH><MeSH>Genome, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>HIV-1</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Kidney</MeSH><MeSH>Kinetics</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Mutagenesis</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Transfer, Lys</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Simian virus 40</MeSH><MeSH>Transfection</MeSH><MeSH>Virus Replication</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>molecule</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30642357"><Journal>BMC systems biology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>An agent-based model of the Notch signaling pathway elucidates three levels of complexity in the determination of developmental patterning.</Title><Abstract>A receptor molecule, Notch (N), and a ligand molecule (in this case Delta or Dl) are the central molecules in this pathway.In early Drosophila embryos, these molecules determine neural vs. skin fates in a reproducible rosette pattern.</Abstract><MeSH>Feedback, Physiological</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Notch</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>molecule</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32077700"><Journal>The journal of physical chemistry.

pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE.Emerging data have implicated a critical role for CD4 in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).This study was designed to delineate the contribution of CD4(+) T cells in the pathogenesis of SLE disease.Disease activity was assessed using the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI).Percentage of CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(+) cell

well as immunotherapy have improved the prognosis of this large group of complex malignant diseases.While several mechanisms of drug chemoresistance are well defined, resistance to immunotherapy is still insufficiently unclear due to the complexity of the immune response and its dependence on the host.Expression and regulation of immune checkpoint molecules (such as PD-1, CD279; PD-L1, CD274; and CTLA-4, CD152) play a key role in the response to immunotherapy.In this regard, immunotherapy based on immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) is a common clinical approach for treatment of patients with poor prognosis when other first-line therapies have failed.Multiple factors can be related to immunotherapy resistance: characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME); presence of tumor

classes, many of them with unknown function and sharing low similarity to other proteins.The structures of 16 SARS-CoV proteins or functional domains have been determined to date.The results of SARS-CoV structural proteomics initiatives will have several profound biological impacts, including elucidation of the structure-function relationships of coronavirus proteins; identification of targets for the design of anti-viral compounds against SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses; and addition of new protein folds to the fold space, with further understanding of the structure-function relationships for several new protein families.We discuss the use of structural proteomics in response to emerging infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV and to increase preparedness against future

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) transmembrane protein transporter is known for conferring resistance to treatment in cancers. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising anti-cancer method involving the use of light-activated photosensitisers to precisely induce oxidative stress and cell death in cancers. ABCG2 can efflux photosensitisers from out of cells, reducing the capacity of PDT and limiting the efficacy of treatment. Many studies have attempted to elucidate the relationship between the expression of ABCG2 in cancers, its effect on the cellular retention of photosensitisers and its impact on PDT. This review looks at the studies which investigate the effect of ABCG2 on a range of different photosensitisers in different pre-clinical models of cancer. This work also evaluates the approaches that are being investigated to address the role of ABCG2 in PDT with an outlook on potential clinical validation.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>protein ABCG2 transmembrane</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31780416"><Journal>Comptes rendus biologies</Journal><Year/><Title>Expression and regulation of ABCG2/BCRP1 by sex steroids in the Harderian gland of the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).</Title><Abstract>Expression and regulation of ABCG2/BCRP1 by sex steroids in the Harderian gland of the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). The ATP-Binding Cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) transporter is associated with the regulation of protoporphyrin IX transport and of other intermediates in heme biosynthesis. Because the hamster Harderian gland (HG) exhibits high concentrations of porphyrins and sexual dimorphism, we analyzed the hamster ABCG2. Cloned cDNA [2098-base pairs (bp)] contains an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1971-bp that encodes a 656 amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 72844.56Da. The hamster ABCG2 sequence is conserved phylogenetically and shares a high percentage of identity with mouse (89%), rat (88%), and human (84%) transporters. Within its structure, a Walker A (G-X-X-G-X-G-K-S), a C signature motif characteristic of ABC transporters, and six putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) were identified. ABCG2 mRNA was detected in all hamster tissues, with higher amounts found in HG, brain, cerebellum, kidney, gut, ovary, and testis. Harderian ABCG2 expression exhibits a sexually dimorphic pattern where females display higher mRNA levels than males. Different patterns of transcriptional profiles of ABCG2 during the estrous cycle and after gonadectomy in both sexes were also observed. The differential expression between male and female HGs suggests that ABCG2 is under the regulation of gonadal steroids. The ABCG2 transporter is likely involved in the endogenous regulation of porphyrins in hamster HGs.</Abstract><MeSH>ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cricetinae</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Complementary</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gonadal Steroid Hormones</MeSH><MeSH>Harderian Gland</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mesocricetus</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Porphyrins</MeSH><MeSH>Protoporphyrins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH><MeSH>Sex Characteristics</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>protein ABCG2 transmembrane</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31664714"><Journal>Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Protein Expression and Functional Relevance of Efflux and Uptake Drug Transporters at the Blood-Brain Barrier of Human Brain and Glioblastoma.</Title><Abstract>Protein Expression and Functional Relevance of Efflux and Uptake Drug Transporters at the Blood-Brain Barrier of Human Brain and Glioblastoma.

The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program with the goal of generating a large-scale and comprehensive catalogue of perturbation-response signatures by utilizing a diverse collection of perturbations across many model systems and assay types. The LINCS Data Portal (LDP) has been the primary access point for the compendium of LINCS data and has been widely utilized. Here, we report the first major update of LDP (http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/signatures) with substantial changes in the data architecture and APIs, a completely redesigned user interface, and enhanced curated metadata annotations to support more advanced, intuitive and deeper querying, exploration and analysis capabilities. The cornerstone of this update has been the decision to reprocess all high-level LINCS datasets and make them accessible at the data point level enabling users to directly access and download any subset of signatures across the entire library independent from the originating source, project or assay. Access to the individual signatures also enables the newly implemented signature search functionality, which utilizes the iLINCS platform to identify conditions that mimic or reverse gene set queries. A newly designed query interface enables global metadata search with autosuggest across all annotations associated with perturbations, model systems, and signatures.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) is a transcription regulatory complex that induces stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early transcription elongation and represses expression of several genes studied to date, including Drosophila Hsp70, mammalian proto-oncogene junB, and HIV RNA. To determine the full spectrum of NELF target genes in Drosophila, we performed a microarray analysis of S2 cells depleted of NELF and discovered that NELF RNAi affects many rapidly inducible genes involved in cellular responses to stimuli. Surprisingly, only one-third of NELF target genes were, like Hsp70, up-regulated by NELF-depletion, whereas the majority of target genes showed decreased expression levels upon NELF RNAi. Our data reveal that the presence of stalled Pol II at this latter group of genes enhances gene expression by maintaining a permissive chromatin architecture around the promoter-proximal region, and that loss of Pol II stalling at these promoters is accompanied by a significant increase in nucleosome occupancy and a decrease in histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation. These findings identify a novel, positive role for stalled Pol II in regulating gene expression and suggest that there is a dynamic interplay between stalled Pol II and chromatin structure.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Footprinting</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila melanogaster</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Dominant</MeSH><MeSH>Luciferases</MeSH><MeSH>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Polymerase II</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Numerous amino acids and their analogs are capable of protecting biological systems from the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. These radioprotective agents can be classified into two broad groups, depending upon the presence or absence of a free or potentially free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been studied extensively and are thought to exert their radioprotective effects by several mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and hydrogen atom donation. Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities. In short, the study of amino acids and their derivatives as radioprotective agents continues to contribute to an understanding of processes involved in radiation toxicity and to offer new compounds with potential application to situations of human exposure. </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radioprotective compounds</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30361949"><Journal>Archives of pharmacal research</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>Pharmacology of natural radioprotectors.</Title><Abstract>Pharmacology of natural radioprotectors.

Hemochromatosis.Although hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with the mutation of genes involved in iron transport and metabolism, secondary hemochromatosis is due to external factors, such as intended or unintended iron overload, hemolysis-linked iron exposure or other stress-impaired iron metabolism.The present review addresses diet-linked etiologies of hemochromatosis and their pathogenesis in the network of genes and nutrients.Although the mechanistic association to diet-linked etiologies can be complicated, the stress sentinels are pivotally involved in the pathological processes of secondary hemochromatosis in response to iron excess and other external stresses.Moreover, the mutations in these sentineling pathway-linked genes increase susceptibility to secondary hemochromatosis.Thus, the crosstalk between nutrients and genes would verify the complex procedures in the clinical outcomes of secondary hemochromatosis and chronic complications, such as malignancy.All of this evidence provides crucial insights into comprehensive clinical or nutritional interventions for hemochromatosis.</Abstract><MeSH>Gene Expression

dysfunction.HFE hereditary hemochromatosis is mostly found in Europeans and is almost always a result of two mutations: C282Y and H63D.The H63D mutation is not as penetrant as the C282Y mutation, but there are rare reported cases of hereditary hemochromatosis with homozygous H63D genotype.Other types of hereditary hemochromatosis are rare and broadly defined as non-HFE hereditary hemochromatosis and include mutations in the hemojuvelin gene, hepcidin (HAMP gene), transferrin receptor 2 gene, and ferroportin gene.Hereditary hemochromatosis is commonly found in populations of European origin; in contrast, it is rare and less well understood in Asia.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms. Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs).</Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Bacillus anthracis</MeSH><MeSH>Genome</MeSH><MeSH>Gorilla gorilla</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Pan troglodytes</MeSH><MeSH>Phylogeny</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Alignment</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Smith&#8211;Waterman algorithm</QueryUsed><Result PMID="17946720"><Journal>Conference proceedings : ...

Cells have evolved exquisite mechanisms to fine-tune the rate of protein synthesis in response to stress. Systemic mapping of start-codon positions and precise measurement of the corresponding initiation rate would transform our understanding of translational control. Here we present quantitative translation initiation sequencing (QTI-seq), with which the initiating ribosomes can be profiled in real time at single-nucleotide resolution. Resultant initiation maps not only delineated variations of start-codon selection but also highlighted a dynamic range of initiation rates in response to nutrient starvation. The integrated data set provided unique insights into principles of alternative translation and mechanisms controlling different aspects of translation initiation. With RiboTag mice, QTI-seq permitted tissue-specific profiling of initiating ribosomes in vivo. Liver cell-specific ribosome profiling uncovered a robust translational reprogramming of the proteasome system in fasted mice. Our findings illuminated the prevalence and dynamic nature of translational regulation pivotal to physiological adaptation in vivo. </Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Culture Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Culture Media</MeSH><MeSH>HEK293 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Liver</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Transgenic</MeSH><MeSH>Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational</MeSH><MeSH>Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Biosynthesis</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Ribosomes</MeSH><MeSH>Stress, Physiological</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>RiboTag profiling</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32528249"><Journal>Frontiers in cellular neuroscience</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Cell-Specific Transcriptional Responses to Heat Shock in the Mouse Utricle Epithelium.</Title><Abstract>Cell-Specific Transcriptional Responses to Heat Shock in the Mouse Utricle Epithelium.

They play diverse roles in reward and aversion, suggesting that they be comprised of several functionally distinct sub-groups, but our understanding of this diversity has been limited by a lack of molecular markers that might provide genetic entry points for cell type-specific investigations. To address this, we conducted transcriptional profiling of GABA neurons and dopamine neurons using immunoprecipitation of tagged polyribosomes (RiboTag) and RNAseq. First, we directly compared these two transcriptomes in order to obtain a list of genes enriched in GABA neurons compared with dopamine neurons. Next, we created a novel bioinformatic approach, that used the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) gene ontology database and VTA gene expression data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, from which we obtained 6 candidate genes: Cbln4, Rxfp3, Rora, Gpr101, Trh and Nrp2. As a final step, we verified the selective expression of these candidate genes in sub-groups of GABA neurons in the VTA (and neighbouring substantia nigra pars compacta) using immunolabelling. Taken together, our study provides a valuable toolbox for the future investigation of GABA neuron sub-groups in the VTA.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Malignant T Cells.</Title><Abstract>SATB1 in Malignant T Cells.Deficient expression of SATB1 hampers thymocyte development and results in inept T-cell lineages.Recent data implicate dysregulated SATB1 expression in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides, the most frequent variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.Here, we report on a disease stage-associated decrease of SATB1 expression and an inverse expression of STAT5 and SATB1 in situ.STAT5 inhibited SATB1 expression through induction of microRNA-155.Decreased SATB1 expression triggered enhanced expression of IL-5 and IL-9 (but not IL-6 and IL-32), whereas increased SATB1 expression had the opposite effect, indicating that the microRNA-155 target SATB1 is a repressor of IL-5 and IL-9 in malignant T cells.In accordance, inhibition of STAT5 and its upstream activator JAK3 triggered increased SATB1 expression and a concomitant suppression of IL-5 and IL-9 expression in malignant T cells.In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic link between the proto-oncogenic JAK3/STAT5/microRNA-155 pathway, SATB1, and cytokines linked to CTCL severity and progression, indicating that SATB1 dysregulation is involved in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

In July 2017, a medical accident occurred in South Korea, in which I-iodide solution was misadministered to the wrong patient. Although the International Commission on Radiological Protection provided internal dose coefficients for iodine for blocked thyroid, they were not reliable enough for determining the dose to the patient (whose thyroid uptake was incompletely blocked) due to a discrepancy in biokinetics. Therefore, a personalized dose assessment was performed to derive the individual-specific dose coefficients for the patient. Initially, the thyroid biokinetics of the patient were statistically clarified by fitting bioassay monitoring results and the corresponding predicted bioassay values, which were calculated repeatedly for varying iodine transfer rates in an iodine biokinetic model. After determining the transfer rate for the patient, the individual-specific dose coefficients were then calculated in accordance with latest recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. According to the individual-specific biokinetics, the 24 h thyroid uptake fraction of iodine was estimated as 0.52%. The thyroid absorbed dose of the patient was evaluated as 21.2 Gy, which differed greatly (by about 9 Gy) from the dose evaluated simply using the reference data for blocked thyroid uptake. The personalized dose assessment carried out for the patient not only reduced considerable uncertainties in the internal dose calculation, but also improved the reliability of the calculated internal dose by adopting the latest dosimetric data, including specific absorbed fraction values based on voxel phantoms. Through the dose assessment of the patient, the methodology of personalized dose assessment considering individual-specific biokinetics was developed.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>iodine thyroid blocking</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30920994"><Journal>Health physics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Internal Dose Assessment after 131I-Iodide Misadministration in a Patient With Incompletely Blocked Thyroid Uptake: Personalized Internal Dose Assessment by Estimating Individual-Specific Biokinetics.</Title><Abstract>Internal Dose Assessment after 131I-Iodide Misadministration in a Patient With Incompletely Blocked Thyroid Uptake: Personalized Internal Dose Assessment by Estimating Individual-Specific Biokinetics. In July 2017, a medical accident occurred in South Korea, in which I-iodide solution was misadministered to the wrong patient. Although the International Commission on Radiological Protection provided internal dose coefficients for iodine for blocked thyroid, they were not reliable enough for determining the dose to the patient (whose thyroid uptake was incompletely blocked) due to a discrepancy in biokinetics. Therefore, a personalized dose assessment was performed to derive the individual-specific dose coefficients for the patient. Initially, the thyroid biokinetics of the patient were statistically clarified by fitting bioassay monitoring results and the corresponding predicted bioassay values, which were calculated repeatedly for varying iodine transfer rates in an iodine biokinetic model. After determining the transfer rate for the patient, the individual-specific dose coefficients were then calculated in accordance with latest recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. According to the individual-specific biokinetics, the 24 h thyroid uptake fraction of iodine was estimated as 0.52%. The thyroid absorbed dose of the patient was evaluated as 21.2 Gy, which differed greatly (by about 9 Gy) from the dose evaluated simply using the reference data for blocked thyroid uptake. The personalized dose assessment carried out for the patient not only reduced considerable uncertainties in the internal dose calculation, but also improved the reliability of the calculated internal dose by adopting the latest dosimetric data, including specific absorbed fraction values based on voxel phantoms. Through the dose assessment of the patient, the methodology of personalized dose assessment considering individual-specific biokinetics was developed.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Computer Simulation</MeSH><MeSH>Digestive System</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Iodine Radioisotopes</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Phantoms, Imaging</MeSH><MeSH>Radiation Dosage</MeSH><MeSH>Radiation Exposure</MeSH><MeSH>Radiation Monitoring</MeSH><MeSH>Radiation Protection</MeSH><MeSH>Thyroid Gland</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>iodine thyroid blocking</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32616734"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.</Title><Abstract>Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.A single administration of an iodine thyroid blocking agent is usually sufficient to protect thyroid from radioactive iodine and prevent thyroid cancer.Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.A single administration of an iodine thyroid blocking agent is usually sufficient to protect thyroid from radioactive iodine and prevent thyroid cancer.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>iodine thyroid blocking</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32616734"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.</Title><Abstract>Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.A single administration of an iodine thyroid blocking agent is usually sufficient to protect thyroid from radioactive iodine and prevent thyroid cancer.Effects of repetitive Iodine thyroid blocking on the foetal brain and thyroid in rats: a systems biology approach.A single administration of an iodine thyroid blocking agent is usually sufficient to protect thyroid from radioactive iodine and prevent thyroid cancer.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>iodine thyroid blocking</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31135910"><Journal>Radiation protection dosimetry</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>PRACTICAL METHODS FOR INTERNAL DOSE ASSESSMENT FOR RADIOIODINE INTAKE AFTER THYROID BLOCKING: CLASSIFICATION OF DEGREE OF BLOCKAGE AND DETERMINATION OF INSENSITIVE MEASUREMENT POINT.</Title><Abstract>Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) suppresses the uptake of iodine to the thyroid and reduces internal doses after radioiodine intake; however, its disturbance of thyroid biokinetics causes considerable uncertainty in the use of dosimetric data intended for assessment of unblocked normal thyroid.PRACTICAL METHODS FOR INTERNAL DOSE ASSESSMENT FOR RADIOIODINE INTAKE AFTER THYROID BLOCKING: CLASSIFICATION OF DEGREE OF BLOCKAGE AND DETERMINATION OF INSENSITIVE MEASUREMENT POINT.Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) suppresses the uptake of iodine to the thyroid and reduces internal doses after radioiodine intake; however, its disturbance of thyroid biokinetics causes considerable uncertainty in the use of dosimetric data intended for assessment of unblocked normal thyroid.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Sera of patients with generalized form of meningococcus infection showed an increase (by the 2nd--3rd week) and a rapid reduction (by the 4th week) of the specific antibodies titres to the levels seen during the first days of the disease. At the remote periods after the disease--in 2 to 5 years--hemagglutinins were revealed in the same titres as in healthy persons (1:10--1:13).

The authors present analysis of the data obtained in titration in the passive hemagglutination test of the sera obtained from 2498 persons with erythrocytes sensitized with specific polysaccharide of group A meningococcus. It appeared that in children aged under one year, even in those suffering from a generalized form of meningococcus infection, antibodies almost failed to be produced, whereas in older children the mean geometrical of the titre on the 5th-14th days of the disease constituted 1:343. The mean titres in the localized forms (nasopharyngitis and carriership) constituted 1:29.5 and 1:15.1, respectively; in the case of detection in the nasopharynx of meningococcus of group A the mean titre was 1:61. One to two months after sustaining any form of the infection the antibodies disappeared almost completely. Thus, the detected antibodies served as the indices of a recent meningococcus infection, including the asymptomatic one. From 12 to 49% of the persons with antibodies to meningococcus A in titres of 1:20 and over were found in the collective bodies in which meningitis patients were present. No antibodies were revealed in the donor sera collected in the localities with complete absence of meningitis, but in the localities with the recorded meningitis morbidity the sera contained antibodies to meningococcus of group A, the percentage varying from 1.5 to 40 depending on the epidemic curve level. A conclusion was drawn that detection in the collective bodies of over 10% of the persons reacting positively in the passive hemagglutination test with polysaccharide of group A meningococcus pointed to the threatening epidemic situation, despite the seeming welfare.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Bacterial</MeSH><MeSH>Carrier State</MeSH><MeSH>Child</MeSH><MeSH>Hemagglutination Tests</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Infant</MeSH><MeSH>Infant, Newborn</MeSH><MeSH>Meningococcal Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Nasopharyngitis</MeSH><MeSH>Serotyping</MeSH><MeSH>Species Specificity</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>diseases Meningococcus B</QueryUsed><Result PMID="665026"><Journal>Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii i immunobiologii</Journal><Year>1978</Year><Title>[Detection of the etiologic structure of generalized and localized forms of meningococcal infection using the passive hemagglutination test].</Title><Abstract>[Detection of the etiologic structure of generalized and localized forms of meningococcal infection using the passive hemagglutination test]. Preparations of formalin-treated erythrocytes sensitized with meningococcus polysaccharides of serological groups A, C, X, Y, and Z were used for the purpose of examination of patients with meningococcus infection; these preparations were highly specific in the tests of precipitation, hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition. Indirect hemagglutination test with the sera of 99 patients suffering from generalized forms of meningococcus infection was conducted with the mentioned preparations in Moscow and Novosibirsk in 1974--1975 when a stable morbidity decline was noted in these towns after an epidemic rise. The diagnostic value of this test was confirmed: it permitted to diagnose meningococcus etiology beginning from the 5th day of the disease and to decipher it from the aspect of individual serological groups. As shown, the incidence of cases caused by serological group A, reaching 87% at the height of the epidemic rise, fell to 49.5% at the stage of decline. Cases caused by group Y which was not encountered formerly were revealed in 16.2% of the patients. Among 127 patients with miningitis of nonmeningococcus etiology meningococcus antibodies to groups A and Y were revealed with the same frequency (in titres of not over 1 : 20--1 : 80), but the leading role of serological group A in the etiology of the manifest forms permitted to draw a conclusion on the presence of a higher invasiveness in the strains of group A.</Abstract><MeSH>Hemagglutination Tests</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Meningococcal Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Moscow</MeSH><MeSH>Serotyping</MeSH><MeSH>Siberia</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Cellular membranes are anything but flat structures. They display a wide variety of complex and beautiful shapes, most of which have evolved for a particular physiological reason and are adapted to accommodate certain cellular demands. In membrane trafficking events, the dynamic remodelling of cellular membranes is apparent. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis for example, the plasma membrane undergoes heavy deformation to generate and internalize a highly curved clathrin-coated vesicle. This process has become a model system to study proteins with the ability to sense and induce membrane curvature and over the last two decades numerous membrane remodelling molecules and molecular mechanisms have been identified in this process. In this review, we discuss the interaction of epsin1 ENTH domain with membranes, which is one of the best-studied examples of a peripheral and transiently membrane bending protein important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process protein clathrin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="9420248"><Journal>Journal of virology</Journal><Year>1998</Year><Title>Interaction of the bovine papillomavirus E6 protein with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1.</Title><Abstract>We propose that BPV-1 E6, through its interaction with AP-1, can affect cellular processes involving clathrin-mediated trafficking pathway.</Abstract><MeSH>Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits</MeSH><MeSH>Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport</MeSH><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Binding Sites</MeSH><MeSH>Bovine papillomavirus 1</MeSH><MeSH>Cattle</MeSH><MeSH>Clathrin</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Golgi Apparatus</MeSH><MeSH>In Vitro Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Membrane Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Membranes</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Oncogene Proteins, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process protein clathrin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30872642"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Clathrin Adaptor Complex-interacting Protein Irc6 Functions through the Conserved C-Terminal Domain.</Title><Abstract>Clathrin Adaptor Complex-interacting Protein Irc6 Functions through the Conserved C-Terminal Domain.

administration of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R/TACR3, a receptor for neurokinin B) antagonist, SB223412, on GnRH pulse-generating activity and pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in ovariectomized Shiba goats treated with luteal phase levels of estrogen.The NK3R antagonist was infused intravenously for 4 h {0.16 or 1.6 mg/(kg body weight [BW]&#183;4 h)} during which multiple unit activity (MUA) in the ARC was recorded, an electrophysiological technique commonly employed to monitor GnRH pulse generator activity.In a separate experiment, the NK3R antagonist (40 or 200 mg/[kg BW&#183;day]) was administered orally for 7 days to determine whether the NK3R antagonist could modulate pulsatile LH secretion when administered via the oral route.Intravenous infusion of the NK3R antagonist significantly increased the interval of episodic bursts of MUA compared with that of the controls.The results of this study demonstrate that peripheral administration of an NK3R antagonist suppresses pulsatile LH secretion by acting on the GnRH pulse generator, suggesting that NK3R antagonist administration could be used to modulate reproductive functions in ruminants.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>NK3R antagonists</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30504731"><Journal>Neuroendocrinology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Neurokinin 3 Receptor Antagonism: A Novel

insights from Drosophila melanogaster.In nearly all animals, maternal gene products regulate the initial events of embryogenesis while the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally silent.Developmental control is then passed from mother to zygote through a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT).The MZT comprises an intimately connected set of molecular events that mediate degradation of maternally deposited mRNAs and transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome.In nearly all animals, maternal gene products regulate the initial events of embryogenesis while the

development of a single-vaccine formula which may ultimately be used to confer protection against both cholera and certain types of Escherichia coli diarrheal disease in humans and domestic animals.The design of the vaccine is based on the well-documented ability of cholera antitoxin to neutralize both cholera and heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins (CT and LT, respectively) and on the ability of killed E. coli to enhance the immune response to cholera toxoid and, possibly, to conventional cholera vaccine as well.Evidence presented shows that a parenterally administered E. coli vaccine, prepared from an LT-only enterotoxigenic strain, reproducibly elevated rabbit antitoxin responses to cholera toxoid and that such responses correlated with dramatic protection against live cholera vibrios and the homologous E. coli strain in the rabbit ligated loop model of diarrheal disease.The results show also that cholera vaccine acted to suppress the rabbits' immune response to the cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine formula, even though all three antigens combined still provided significant protection against live organism challenge.On the basis of data presently available, the vaccine formula would be composed simply of cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine, but may also include cholera vaccine.Since it has already been established that cholera toxoid and cholera vaccine are each safe for human use, additional vaccine development would require investigation of the safety of E. coli vaccine, alone and in combination with the other components.Development of a vaccine

ultimately be used to confer protection against both cholera and certain types of Escherichia coli diarrheal disease in humans and domestic animals.The design of the vaccine is based on the well-documented ability of cholera antitoxin to neutralize both cholera and heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins (CT and LT, respectively) and on the ability of killed E. coli to enhance the immune response to cholera toxoid and, possibly, to conventional cholera vaccine as well.Evidence presented shows that a parenterally administered E. coli vaccine, prepared from an LT-only enterotoxigenic strain, reproducibly elevated rabbit antitoxin responses to cholera toxoid and that such responses correlated with dramatic protection against live cholera vibrios and the homologous E. coli strain in the rabbit ligated loop model of diarrheal disease.The results show also that cholera vaccine acted to suppress the rabbits' immune response to the cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine formula, even though all three antigens combined still provided significant protection against live organism challenge.On the basis of data presently available, the vaccine formula would be composed simply of cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine, but may also include cholera vaccine.Since it has already been established that cholera toxoid and cholera vaccine are each safe for human use, additional vaccine development would require investigation of the safety of E. coli vaccine, alone and in combination with the other components.The results of the present investigation indicate a simple approach to the

Highly effective and minimally toxic antimicrobial agents have been prepared by immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) onto biocompatible chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs). CS-NPs were prepared via ionotropic gelation and used for the immobilization of GOx via approaches of covalent attachment (CA), enzyme coating (EC), enzyme precipitate coating (EPC), and magnetic nanoparticle-incorporated EPC (Mag-EPC). EPC represents an approach consisting of enzyme covalent attachment, precipitation, and cross-linking, with CA and EC being control samples while Mag-EPC was prepared by mixing magnetic nanoparticles (Mag) with enzymes during the preparation of EPC. The GOx activities of CA, EC, EPC, and Mag-EPC were 8.57, 17.7, 219, and 247 units/mg CS-NPs, respectively, representing 26 and 12 times higher activity of EPC than those of CA and EC, respectively. EPC improved the activity and stability of GOx and led to good dispersion of CS-NPs, while Mag-EPC enabled facile magnetic separation. To demonstrate the expandability of the EPC approach to other enzymes, bovine carbonic anhydrase was also employed to prepare EPC and Mag-EPC samples for their characterizations.

respiratory disease.The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry.We constructed chimeric DPP4 receptors that have the virus-binding domains of indigenous Middle Eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting S protein binding and virus entry.These findings suggest that virus receptors and S protein-cleaving proteases combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several Middle Eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting MERS-CoV to humans.The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry.However, even the low-affinity receptors could hypersensitize cells to infection when an S-cleaving protease(s) was present, indicating that affinity thresholds for virus entry must be considered in the context of host-cell proteolytic environments.Receptor variation and susceptibility to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

syndrome coronavirus infection depend on differentiation of human airway epithelia.Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for both the SARS-CoV and the related human respiratory coronavirus NL63, was expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma.As assessed by immunofluorescence staining and membrane biotinylation, ACE2 protein was more abundantly expressed on the apical than the basolateral surface of polarized airway epithelia.Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of epithelia.Undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well-differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected.Expression of ACE2 in poorly differentiated epithelia facilitated SARS spike (S) protein-pseudotyped virus entry.Consistent with the expression pattern of ACE2, the entry of SARS-CoV or a lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein in differentiated epithelia was more efficient when applied to the apical surface.The results indicate that infection of human airway epithelia by SARS coronavirus correlates with the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression and localization.Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for both the SARS-CoV and the related human respiratory coronavirus NL63, was expressed in human airway epithelia as

stress and clinical indices as results of laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children.Laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children has the advantages of quick recovery, little influence of inflammatory and oxidative stress and low infection rate.Altogether 115 children with perforated appendicitis treated in our hospital from June 2018 to August 2019 were selected and divided into two groups according to different treatment methods.Laparoscopic appendectomy was used as the research group (RG) (67 cases) and open appendectomy (48 cases) as the control group (CG).Laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children can effectively reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, postoperative pain, and the damage to the body of children, and can also reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in children.A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate the postoperative pain in children.The postoperative VAS score in RG was significantly lower than that in CG.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

biologics have been evaluated as treatments for lupus nephritis or for the skin and joint manifestations of SLE.The central role for the B-cell in SLE, together with improved knowledge of the targets on the B-cell surface, has prompted efforts to develop monoclonal antibodies as treatments for SLE.</Abstract><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal,

cells, and belimumab, a mAb that binds and neutralizes the B cell survival factor BAFF, have been extensively studied for the treatment of SLE.Despite the greater ability of rituximab to deplete B cells than that of belimumab, randomized controlled trials of rituximab in SLE failed to reach their primary clinical endpoints, whereas the primary clinical endpoints were reached in four independent phase-III clinical trials of belimumab in SLE.Accordingly, belimumab has been approved for treatment of SLE, whereas use of rituximab in SLE remains off-label.In this review, we provide a concise summary of the factors that led to belimumab's success in SLE as well an analysis of the elements that may have contributed to the lack of success seen in the rituximab randomized controlled trials in

Platelet components (PCs) are occasionally associated with adverse transfusion reactions (ATRs). ATRs can occur regardless of the type of PC being transfused, whether it is a single-donor apheresis PC (SDA-PC) or a pooled PC (PPCs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the proteins and dysregulated pathways in both of the main types of PCs. The proteomic profiles of platelet pellets from SDA-PCs and PPCs involved in ATRs were analysed using the label-free LC-MS/MS method. Differentially expressed proteins with fold changes &gt;|1.5| in clinical cases versus controls were characterised using bioinformatic tools (RStudio, GeneCodis3, and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). The proteins were confirmed by western blotting. The common primary proteins found to be dysregulated in both types of PCs were the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (SLC25A20), multimerin-1 (MMRN1), and calumenin (CALU), which are associated with the important enrichment of platelet activation, platelet degranulation, and mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, this analysis revealed the involvement of commonly dysregulated canonical pathways, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction, platelet activation, and acute phase response. This proteomic analysis provided an interesting contribution to our understanding of the meticulous physiopathology of PCs associated with ATR.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Within platelet transfusion strategies, the two primary types of PCs predominantly processed in Europe, include (i) single donor apheresis PCs (SDA-PCs) from one donor and (ii) pooled PCs (PPCs). The current study used PCs from five buffy coats derived from five whole blood donations that were identical in ABO, RH1 and KEL1 groups. Both PC types were shown to be associated with the onset of an ATR in the transfused patient. Several common platelet proteins were found to be dysregulated in bags associated with ATR occurrences regardless of the type of PCs transfused and of their process. The dysregulated proteins included mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (SLC25A20), which is involved in a fatty acid oxidation disorder; calumenin (CALU); and multimerin-1 (MMRN1), which is chiefly involved in platelet activation and degranulation. Dysregulated platelet protein pathways for ATRs that occurred with SDA-PCs and PPCs could support the dysregulated functions found in association with those three proteins.

acts as an inhibitor of GATA family proteins and inhibits Th2 cell differentiation in vitro.</Title><Abstract>The transcription factor GATA3 is a master regulator that modulates T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation and induces expression of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.Therefore, the application of a GATA3 inhibitor provides a new therapeutic strategy to regulate Th2 cytokine production.Here, we established a novel high-throughput screening system for an inhibitor of a DNA-binding protein, such as a transcription factor, and identified pyrrothiogatain as a novel inhibitor of GATA3 DNA-binding activity.Pyrrothiogatain inhibited the DNA-binding activity of GATA3 and other members of the GATA family.Pyrrothiogatain also inhibited the interaction between GATA3 and SOX4, suggesting that it interacts with the DNA-binding region of GATA3.Our results suggest that pyrrothiogatain regulates the differentiation and function of Th2 cells via inhibition of GATA3 DNA binding activity, which demonstrates the efficiency of our drug screening system for the development of novel small compounds that inhibit the DNA-binding activity of transcription factors.Our results suggest

The current study used one or two cues to elicit single- and dual-target searches for orientation targets among similar and dissimilar distractors. In Experiment 1, the accuracy of target discrimination in brief displays was compared at setsizes of 1, 2 and 4. Results revealed a reduction in accuracy that scaled with the product of set size and the number of cued targets. In Experiment 2, the accuracy and latency of observers' saccadic targeting were compared. Fixations on single-target searches were highly selective towards the target. On dual-target searches, the requirement to detect one of two targets produced a significant reduction in target fixations and equivalent rates of fixations to distractors with opposite orientations. For most observers, the dual-target cost was predicted by an SDT model that simulated increases in decision-noise and the distribution of capacity-limited resources during the comparison of selected input against independently cued targets.

Characterizing cellular responses to different extrinsic signals is an active area of research, and curated pathway databases describe these complex signaling reactions. Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules "connected" in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, B-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. B-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathway's downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as B-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways with statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset.

Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are numerous and found throughout the mammalian genome, and many are thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression. However, the majority remain relatively uncharacterised and of uncertain function making the use of model systems to uncover their mode of action valuable. Imprinted lncRNAs target and recruit epigenetic silencing factors to a cluster of imprinted genes on the same chromosome, making them one of the best characterized lncRNAs for silencing distant genes in cis. In this study we examined silencing of the distant imprinted gene Slc22a3 by the lncRNA Airn in the Igf2r imprinted cluster in mouse. Previously we proposed that imprinted lncRNAs may silence distant imprinted genes by disrupting promoter-enhancer interactions by being transcribed through the enhancer, which we called the enhancer interference hypothesis. Here we tested this hypothesis by first using allele-specific chromosome conformation capture (3C) to detect interactions between the Slc22a3 promoter and the locus of the Airn lncRNA that silences it on the paternal chromosome. In agreement with the model, we found interactions enriched on the maternal allele across the entire Airn gene consistent with multiple enhancer-promoter interactions. Therefore, to test the enhancer interference hypothesis we devised an approach to delete the entire Airn gene. However, the deletion showed that there are no essential enhancers for Slc22a2, Pde10a and Slc22a3 within the Airn gene, strongly indicating that the Airn RNA rather than its transcription is responsible for silencing distant imprinted genes. Furthermore, we found that silent imprinted genes were covered with large blocks of H3K27me3 on the repressed paternal allele. Therefore we propose an alternative hypothesis whereby the chromosome interactions may initially guide the lncRNA to target imprinted promoters and recruit repressive chromatin, and that these interactions are lost once silencing is established.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Enhancer Elements, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Silencing</MeSH><MeSH>Genomic Imprinting</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Organic Cation Transport Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Organic Cation Transporter 2</MeSH><MeSH>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Long Noncoding</MeSH><MeSH>Receptor, IGF Type 2</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Deletion</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Slc22a3 imprinted</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31329595"><Journal>PLoS genetics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>The Airn lncRNA does not require any DNA elements within its locus to silence distant imprinted genes.</Title><Abstract>The Airn lncRNA does not require any DNA elements within its locus to silence distant imprinted genes.

The development of large-scale data sets requires a new means to display and disseminate research studies to large audiences. Knowledge of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has become a principle interest of many groups within the field of proteomics. At the confluence of technologies, such as cross-linking mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid, protein cofractionation, and affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), detection of PPIs can uncover novel biological inferences at a high-throughput. Thus new platforms to provide community access to large data sets are necessary. To this end, we have developed a web application that enables exploration and dissemination of the growing BioPlex interaction network. BioPlex is a large-scale interactome data set based on AP-MS of baits from the human ORFeome. The latest BioPlex data set release (BioPlex 2.0) contains 56&#8239;553 interactions from 5891 AP-MS experiments. To improve community access to this vast compendium of interactions, we developed BioPlex Display, which integrates individual protein querying, access to empirical data, and on-the-fly annotation of networks within an easy-to-use and mobile web application. BioPlex Display enables rapid acquisition of data from BioPlex and development of hypotheses based on protein interactions.</Abstract><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Databases, Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Mass Spectrometry</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Interaction Mapping</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Interaction Maps</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>BioPlex network</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32575886"><Journal>Genes</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Predicting Functions of Uncharacterized Human Proteins: From Canonical to Proteoforms.</Title><Abstract>Predicting Functions of Uncharacterized Human Proteins: From Canonical to Proteoforms.

In addition, by now, we lack functional annotation for 1193 genes, where expression was confirmed at the proteomic level (uPE1 proteins). We re-analyzed results of AP-MS experiments from the BioPlex 2.0 database to predict functions of uPE1 proteins and their splice forms. By building a protein-protein interaction network for 12 ths. identified proteins encoded by 11 ths. genes, we were able to predict Gene Ontology categories for a total of 387 uPE1 genes. We predicted different functions for canonical and alternatively spliced forms for four uPE1 genes. In total, functional differences were revealed for 62 proteoforms encoded by 31 genes. Based on these results, it can be carefully concluded that the dynamics and versatility of the interactome is ensured by changing the dominant splice form.

Syndecan-1 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed by endothelial and epithelial cells and involved in wound healing and tumor growth. Surface-expressed syndecan-1 undergoes proteolytic shedding leading to the release of the soluble N-terminal ectodomain from a transmembrane C-terminal fragment (tCTF). We show that the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 17 generates a syndecan-1 tCTF, which can then undergo further intra-membrane proteolysis by &#947;-secretase. Scratch-induced wound closure of cultured lung epithelial A549 tumor cells associates with increased syndecan-1 cleavage as evidenced by the release of shed syndecan-1 ectodomain and enhanced generation of the tCTF. Both wound closure and the associated syndecan-1 shedding can be suppressed by inhibition of ADAM family proteases. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion into matrigel as well as several signaling pathways implicated in these responses are suppressed by silencing of syndecan-1. These defects of syndecan-1 deficient cells can be overcome by overexpression of syndecan-1 tCTF or a corresponding tCTF of syndecan-4 but not by overexpression of a tCTF lacking the transmembrane domain. Finally, lung metastasis formation of A549 cells in SCID mice was found to be dependent on syndecan-1, and the presence of syndecan-1 tCTF was sufficient for this activity. Thus, the syndecan-1 tCTF by itself is capable of mediating critical syndecan-1-dependent functions in cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis formation and therefore can replace full length syndecan-1 in the situation of increased syndecan-1 shedding during cell migration and tumor formation. </Abstract><MeSH>ADAM Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>ADAM17

The JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling pathway drives cellular growth, differentiation, and the immune response. STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. We previously showed that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (ubH2B) is highly dynamic at the STAT1 target gene, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), suggesting that a deubiquitinase is recruited during gene activation. Here, we report that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitin hydrolase, USP22, results in 2-fold higher ubH2B, and 2-fold lower transcriptional elongation at IRF1. We also demonstrate that USP22 depletion diminishes 3'-end cleavage/polyadenylation by 2- to 3-fold. Furthermore, the polyadenylation factor CPSF73 is not effectively recruited, and serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is also disrupted. The transcriptional and processing defects observed in the USP22-knockdown cells are reversed by transient USP22 overexpression. Together, these results suggest that ubH2B helps recruit polyadenylation factors to STAT1-activated genes. We propose a working model, wherein a cycle of H2B ubiquitination/deubiquitination specifies Ser2P to regulate elongation and 3'-end processing of JAK-STAT-inducible mRNAs. These results further elaborate USP22 function and its role as a putative cancer stem cell marker.</Abstract><MeSH>3' Untranslated Regions</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Death</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Primers</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Knockdown Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Interferon Regulatory Factor-1</MeSH><MeSH>Janus Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Processing, Post-Translational</MeSH><MeSH>RNA 3' End Processing</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Polymerase II</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>STAT Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Thiolester Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Ubiquitination</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process JAK/STAT</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32020553"><Journal>Drugs</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>JAK Inhibitors for Treatment of Psoriasis: Focus on Selective TYK2 Inhibitors.</Title><Abstract>The Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway plays a significant role in intracellular signalling of cytokines of numerous cellular processes, important in both normal and pathological states of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

tumor suppressor gene PTEN to promote the emergence of metastatic prostate cancer.Mechanistically, we find that androgens suppress CDCP1 expression and that androgen deprivation in combination with loss of PTEN promotes the upregulation of CDCP1 and the subsequent activation of the SRC/MAPK pathway.Thus, our study identifies CDCP1 as a powerful driver of prostate cancer progression and uncovers different potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metastatic prostate tumors.CDCP1 overexpression drives prostate cancer progression and can be targeted in vivo.The mechanisms by which prostate cancer shifts from an indolent castration-sensitive phenotype to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are poorly understood.Notably, CDCP1 cooperates with the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN to promote the emergence of metastatic prostate cancer.Moreover, we demonstrate that anti-CDCP1 immunoliposomes (anti-CDCP1 ILs) loaded with chemotherapy suppress prostate cancer growth when administered in combination with enzalutamide.Thus, our study identifies CDCP1 as a powerful driver of prostate cancer progression and uncovers different potential therapeutic strategies

Thus, a modified Mayo score and an endoscopic index (EI) were developed for use in cynomolgus macaques with 0.25% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis. Macaques were treated with water with DSS for two weeks followed by water without DSS for two weeks. Disease activity was classified according to a modified Mayo score: stool consistency, rectal bleeding, colonoscopy examination and global assessment. Findings on colonoscopy were further graded according the Rachmilewitz EI. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the modified Mayo score and EI to therapeutic intervention, macaques were treated with the anti-inflammatory steroid prednisolone followed eight weeks later by the integrin antibody vedolizumab. Before DSS treatment, normal stool consistency and no rectal bleeding were observed. Colonoscopy demonstrated no mucosal abnormalities. Following the first DSS treatment, Mayo score and EI indicated signs of mild colitis. Following subsequent DSS treatments, mild to moderate colitis emerged with each DSS treatment and reduced signs of colitis were observed 2 weeks after DSS treatment termination. Prednisolone treatment during DSS treatment suppressed the emergence of colitis.

bortezomib-resistant MM.Hence, we designed dual inhibitors targeting both HDACs and proteasomes to address the resistance of bortezomib.While proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib showed

Cells.</Title><Abstract>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is elementary for cellular protein degradation and gained rising attention as a new target for cancer therapy due to promising clinical trials with bortezomib, the first-in class proteasome inhibitor meanwhile approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.Both bortezomib and next-generation proteasome inhibitors mediate their effects by targeting the 20S core particle of the 26S proteasome.Moreover, it has been shown that bortezomib impairs dendritic cell (DC) phenotype and function at different levels.In the present study, we comparatively analyzed effects of bortezomib and b-AP15 on monocyte-derived DCs.In line with previous results, bortezomib exposure impaired maturation, antigen uptake, migration, cytokine secretion and immunostimulation, whereas treatment with b-AP15 had no compromising effects on these DC features.The ubiquitin-proteasome system is elementary for cellular protein degradation and gained rising attention as a new target for cancer therapy due to promising clinical trials with bortezomib, the first-in class proteasome inhibitor meanwhile approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.Both bortezomib and next-generation proteasome inhibitors mediate their effects by targeting the 20S core particle of the 26S proteasome.Our findings warrant the further investigation of b-AP15 as an alternative to clinically approved proteasome inhibitors in the therapy of malignancies, especially in the context of combinatorial treatment with DC-based

Numerous amino acids and their analogs are capable of protecting biological systems from the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. These radioprotective agents can be classified into two broad groups, depending upon the presence or absence of a free or potentially free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been studied extensively and are thought to exert their radioprotective effects by several mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and hydrogen atom donation. Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities. In short, the study of amino acids and their derivatives as radioprotective agents continues to contribute to an understanding of processes involved in radiation toxicity and to offer new compounds with potential application to situations of human exposure. </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radioprotection agents</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31677733"><Journal>Neuroimaging clinics of North America</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Introduction to Diagnostic and Therapeutic Spinal Angiography.</Title><Abstract>Introduction to Diagnostic and Therapeutic Spinal Angiography.

Considering the remarkable application of radiotherapy in the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases and even nuclear war, it is important to protect healthy tissues and people at risk from the radiation. Currently, there is no ideal and safe radioprotective agent available and we are seeing a great effort to find these agents from natural sources. Phenolic compounds, as well as flavonoid, are presented widely as the second metabolite in plants and they have been considered for investigation according to their benefits for human health, healing and preventing many disorders. The major bioactive benefits of flavonoids include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-aging, anti-bacterial and viral, neuroprotection and radioprotective effects. Their lower toxicity and oral administration have made it suitable for radiotherapy patient, radiation, military forces, and even the general public. This review attempts to provide a summary of the main molecular mechanisms involved in flavonoid radio-protective effects. Data of these studies will provide a comprehensive perspective to flavonoids and can help to optimize their effects in radioprotection procedures.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

important to understand the functions of lncRNA.In this study, we proposed a projection-based neighborhood non-negative matrix decomposition model (PMKDN) to predict potential lncRNA-protein

myocardial infarction (MI) remain largely unknown.Thus, we used the subp athway-LINCE method to characterize the potential roles of lncRNAs in MI.Then the lncRNA and mRNA co-expression relationship pairs (LncGenePairs) were screened from the lncRNAs and mRNA intersections, which were extracted through candidate lncRNA-mRNA interactions and sample gene expression profiles.The lncRNAs in LncGenePairs were embedded into pathway graphs as nodes through linking to their regulated mRNAs, which resulted in obtaining condition-specific lncRNA competitively regulated signal pathways (csLncRPs).Based on the statistical significance of signal subpathways, lncRNA-mRNA networks were constructed, in which hub lncRNAs were selected.A total of 65 lncRNAs competitively regulated subpathways and 13 hub lncRNAs were obtained, which associated with a risk of MI.Identifying lncRNAs competitively regulated subpathways not only provides potential lncRNA biomarkers for MI, but also

The Nipah virus fusion (F) protein is proteolytically processed to F1 + F2 subunits.We demonstrate here that cathepsin L is involved in this important maturation event.Cathepsin inhibitors ablated cleavage of Nipah F. Proteolytic processing of Nipah F and fusion activity was dramatically reduced in cathepsin L shRNA-expressing Vero cells.Additionally, Nipah virus F-mediated fusion was inhibited in cathepsin L-deficient cells, but coexpression of cathepsin L restored fusion activity.Both purified cathepsin L and B could cleave immunopurified Nipah F protein, but only cathepsin L produced products of the correct size.Our results suggest that endosomal cathepsins can cleave Nipah F, but that cathepsin L specifically converts Nipah F to a mature and fusogenic form.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cathepsin B</MeSH><MeSH>Cathepsin L</MeSH><MeSH>Cathepsins</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Fusion</MeSH><MeSH>Chlorocebus aethiops</MeSH><MeSH>Cricetinae</MeSH><MeSH>Cysteine Endopeptidases</MeSH><MeSH>Enzyme Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Silencing</MeSH><MeSH>Nipah Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Processing, Post-Translational</MeSH><MeSH>Vero Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Viral Fusion Proteins</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

frequency distributions indicating a regulated shift in the balance point.Fos activation was increased in the MnPO but no induction of Fos was found in NK3R (EGFP-immunoreactive) neurons.Thus, MnPO NK3R neurons are not activated by warm thermosensors in the skin or viscera and are not warm-sensitive neurons.Finally, RNAscope was used to determine whether Tacr3 (NK3R) mRNA was coexpressed with vesicular glutamate transporter 2 or vesicular &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter mRNA, markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, respectively.In the MnPO, 94% of NK3R neurons were glutamatergic, but in the adjacent medial preoptic area, 97% of NK3R neurons were GABAergic.Thus, NK3R neurons in the MnPO are glutamatergic and play a role in reducing TCORE but are not activated by warm thermal stimuli (internal or external).These findings suggest that KNDy neurons modulate thermosensory pathways for heat defense indirectly via a subpopulation of glutamatergic MnPO neurons that express NK3R.To characterize the thermoregulatory role of MnPO NK3R neurons in female mice, we ablated these neurons using injections of saporin toxin conjugated to a selective NK3R agonist.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Body Temperature Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Dynorphins</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Glutamic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Hot Flashes</MeSH><MeSH>Hot

A novel pure insulin spray-dried powder for DPI product (Ins_SD) was studied with respect to physico-chemical stability, in vitro respirability, bioavailability, activity and tolerability. Ins_SD powder exhibited a very high in vitro respirability, independently of the DPI product preparation (manual or semi-automatic). Physico-chemical characteristics of Ins_SD powder remained within the pharmacopoeia limits during 6&#8239;months of storage at room temperature. PK/PD profiles were measured in rats that received the pulmonary powders by intratracheal insufflation and compared with Afrezza inhalation insulin.
