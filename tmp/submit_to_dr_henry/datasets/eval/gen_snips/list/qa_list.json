Access to DNA packaged in nucleosomes is critical for gene regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) complex detects UV-light-induced pyrimidine dimers throughout the genome; however, it remains unknown how these lesions are recognized in chromatin, in which nucleosomes restrict access to DNA. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of UV-DDB bound to nucleosomes bearing a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimer or a DNA-damage mimic in various positions. We find that UV-DDB binds UV-damaged nucleosomes at lesions located in the solvent-facing minor groove without affecting the overall nucleosome architecture. In the case of buried lesions that face the histone core, UV-DDB changes the predominant translational register of the nucleosome and selectively binds the lesion in an accessible, exposed position. Our findings explain how UV-DDB detects occluded lesions in strongly positioned nucleosomes, and identify slide-assisted site\u00a0exposure as a mechanism by which high-affinity DNA-binding proteins can access otherwise occluded sites in nucleosomal DNA."

Numerous amino acids and their analogs are capable of protecting biological systems from the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. These radioprotective agents can be classified into two broad groups, depending upon the presence or absence of a free or potentially free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been studied extensively and are thought to exert their radioprotective effects by several mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and hydrogen atom donation. Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities. In short, the study of amino acids and their derivatives as radioprotective agents continues to contribute to an understanding of processes involved in radiation toxicity and to offer new compounds with potential application to situations of human exposure.

A limitation of currently used preclinical models of colitis is that disease and treatment assessment methods differ from clinically used methods. Thus, a modified Mayo score and an endoscopic index (EI) were developed for use in cynomolgus macaques with 0.25% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis. Macaques were treated with water with DSS for two weeks followed by water without DSS for two weeks. Disease activity was classified according to a modified Mayo score: stool consistency, rectal bleeding, colonoscopy examination and global assessment. Findings on colonoscopy were further graded according the Rachmilewitz EI. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the modified Mayo score and EI to therapeutic intervention, macaques were treated with the anti-inflammatory steroid prednisolone followed eight weeks later by the integrin antibody vedolizumab. Before DSS treatment, normal stool consistency and no rectal bleeding were observed. Colonoscopy demonstrated no mucosal abnormalities. Following the first DSS treatment, Mayo score and EI indicated signs of mild colitis. Following subsequent DSS treatments, mild to moderate colitis emerged with each DSS treatment and reduced signs of colitis were observed 2 weeks after DSS treatment termination. Prednisolone treatment during DSS treatment suppressed the emergence of colitis. Vedolizumab reduced signs of colitis during DSS treatment and further reduced signs of colitis that persisted after termination of DSS treatment. The current study demonstrated the potential of utilizing clinical outcome measures to assess experimentally-induced colitis in the macaque. Furthermore, signs of colitis, as assessed with the current methods, were reduced following therapeutic treatment. The current findings suggest that clinically relevant outcome measures in the macaque model of ulcerative colitis could be used to test novel treatments."

Potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Coronavirus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear. This review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective. We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway. Given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019."

The stable encapsulation does not restrain its radioprotective capability, and exhibits prolonged retention time in blood with a half-life of \u223c10 h, thereby showing more beneficial effects than the pure agent in therapeutic efficacy for irradiated mice."

Physico-chemical characteristics of Ins_SD powder remained within the pharmacopoeia limits during 6\u202fmonths of storage at room temperature. PK/PD profiles were measured in rats that received the pulmonary powders by intratracheal insufflation and compared with Afrezza inhalation insulin. Due to the low drug powder mass to deliver, both insulin powders were diluted with mannitol. Insulin from Ins_SD was promptly absorbed (t"
