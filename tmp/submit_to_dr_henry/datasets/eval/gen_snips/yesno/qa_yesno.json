The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) transmembrane protein transporter is known for conferring resistance to treatment in cancers. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising anti-cancer method involving the use of light-activated photosensitisers to precisely induce oxidative stress and cell death in cancers. ABCG2 can efflux photosensitisers from out of cells, reducing the capacity of PDT and limiting the efficacy of treatment. Many studies have attempted to elucidate the relationship between the expression of ABCG2 in cancers, its effect on the cellular retention of photosensitisers and its impact on PDT. This review looks at the studies which investigate the effect of ABCG2 on a range of different photosensitisers in different pre-clinical models of cancer. This work also evaluates the approaches that are being investigated to address the role of ABCG2 in PDT with an outlook on potential clinical validation."
