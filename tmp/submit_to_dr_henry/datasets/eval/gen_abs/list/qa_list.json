However, these vehicles affect not only drug bioavailability, but may also have an impact on gastric emptying, drug disposition, lymphatic absorption and are affected by lipid digestion mechanisms. The work presented here compared pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) in sesame oil vs. a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS). This investigation was conducted with a unique tool termed the \"absorption cocktail approach\". In this concept, selected molecules: metoprolol, THC and ibuprofen were co-administered with CBD in SNEDDS and sesame oil. This method was used to shed light on the complex absorption process of poorly soluble drugs in-vivo, specifically assessing absorption kinetics of CBD. It was found that the concentration vs. time curve following CBD-sesame oil oral administration showed extended input of the drug with delayed Tmax compared to CBD-SNEDDS. Using the \"cocktail\" approach, a unique finding was observed when the less lipophilic compounds (metoprolol and ibuprofen) exited the stomach much earlier than the lipophilic cannabinoids in sesame oil, proving differential absorption kinetics. Findings of the absorption cocktail approach reflected the physiological process of the GI e.g gastric retention, stomach content separation, lipid digestion, drug precipitation and more, demonstrating its utility. Nonetheless, the search for more compounds as suitable molecule probes is underway."

The genetic basis for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML is not well characterized. We previously identified a candidate murine gene for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML (rAML): C-terminal binding protein (CTBP)-interacting protein (CTIP)/retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8). This gene is essential for embryonic development, double-strand break (DSB) resection in homologous recombination (HR) and tumor suppression. In the 129S2/SvHsd mouse strain, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) in Ctip, Q418P, has been identified. We investigated the role of Q418P in radiation-induced carcinogenesis and its effect on CTIP function in HR. After whole-body exposure to 3 Gy of X rays, 11 out of 113 (9.7%) 129S2/SvHsd mice developed rAML. Furthermore, 129S2/SvHsd mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed lower levels of recruitment of HR factors, Rad51 and replication protein A (RPA) to radiation-induced foci, compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6 MEFs, isolated from rAML-sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Mitomycin C and alpha particles induced lower levels of sister chromatid exchanges in 129S2/SvHsd cells compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6. Our data demonstrate that Q418P nsSNP influences the efficiency of CTIP function in HR repair of DNA DSBs in vitro and in vivo, and appears to affect susceptibility to rAML."

Microarray technology is the driving force of this revolution, a technology that allows the simultaneous monitoring of expression for thousands of genes. The need for accurate and reproducible research has driven the development of robust analysis frameworks for maximizing the information content of biological data. In microarray imaging technologies, several non-linearities in the experimental process render the measured expression values prone to variability and often, to poor reproducibility. Accurate segmentation of the true signal is a very important task, not least because a single value per spot needs to be derived for further knowledge discovery analysis. In this paper, we present a fully automatic segmentation method for improving the spot segmentation result. The method doesn't make any assumptions concerning the number of classes present in each image spot, and it isn't driven only by the most intense features, since it takes into account the underlying \"hybridization ground truth\" derived from both information channels of the spotted arrays. Our method is compared to widely used, state-of-the-art segmentation methods in microarray image analysis in a study of a metabolic disorder in yeast, where replicates of reporters are present. Initial results indicate that our method yields more reproducible log ratio measurements across replicates."

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of UV-DDB bound to nucleosomes bearing a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimer or a DNA-damage mimic in various positions. We find that UV-DDB binds UV-damaged nucleosomes at lesions located in the solvent-facing minor groove without affecting the overall nucleosome architecture. In the case of buried lesions that face the histone core, UV-DDB changes the predominant translational register of the nucleosome and selectively binds the lesion in an accessible, exposed position. Our findings explain how UV-DDB detects occluded lesions in strongly positioned nucleosomes, and identify slide-assisted site\u00a0exposure as a mechanism by which high-affinity DNA-binding proteins can access otherwise occluded sites in nucleosomal DNA."

In order to solve the problems, based on the further study of behavior feature extraction and vulnerability detection technology, a method of using dynamic behavior features to detect open source software vulnerabilities is proposed. Firstly, the relationship between open source software vulnerability and API call sequence is studied. Then, the behavioral risk vulnerability database of open source software is proposed as a support for vulnerability detection. In addition, the CNN-IndRNN classification model is constructed by improving the Independently Recurrent Neural Net-work (IndRNN) algorithm and applies to open source software security vulnerability detection.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 135 patients with SLE, including 52 patients with active SLE and 83 patients with inactive SLE and 149 healthy controls. The degree of activity of SLE was assessed using the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). Serum SAA levels were measured using a Cobas 8000 c702 modular analyzer. RESULTS The levels of SAA were significantly increased in patients with active SLE compared with patients with inactive SLE (median IQR, 16.65 mg/L; range, 9.35-39.68 mg/L, and median IQR, 2.30 mg/L, range, 1.30-4.80 mg/L) (p<0.001). Levels of SAA were significantly correlated with the SLEDAI-2K scores, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) in patients with SLE (r=0.726, p<0.001; r=0.631, p<0.001; r=0.774, p<0.001, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the SAA values were independently associated with active SLE when controlled for white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), ESR, and Hs-CRP (OR=1.772; p=0.01; 95% CI, 1.101-2.851). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for SAA was used to identify patients with active SLE with an area under the curve of 0.971, a sensitivity of 90.4%, and a specificity of 94.0%. CONCLUSIONS SAA levels were significantly correlated with disease activity in patients with SLE."

In contrast, we find that RIN-bound mRNAs, which encode core components of the transcription, splicing, and translation machinery, are short, stable, and highly translated. We show that RIN is associated with polysomes and provide evidence for a direct role for RIN and its human homologs in stabilizing and upregulating the translation of their target mRNAs. We propose that when cells are stressed, the resulting incorporation of RIN/G3BPs into SGs sequesters them away from their short target mRNAs.

Although quantification of their soluble form leased from the membrane will provide quick evaluation of patients' immune status, available methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure these soluble factors have limitations in sensitivity and reproducibility for clinical use. To overcome these problems, we developed a rapid and sensitive immunoassay system based on chemiluminescent magnetic technology. The system is fully automated, providing high reproducibility. Application of this system to plasma of patients with several types of tumours demonstrated that soluble PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 levels were increased compared to those of healthy controls and varied among tumour types. The sensitivity and detection range were sufficient for evaluating plasma concentrations before and after the surgical ablation of cancers. Therefore, our newly developed system shows potential for accurate detection of soluble PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 levels in the clinical practice."

Here, we investigated the effects of LINC-PINT on lung cancer progression. Firstly, in our study, we implied that LINC-PINT was obviously decreased in NSCLC. Thereafter, in A549 and H1299 cells, LINC-PINT was upregulated via transfecting LV-LINC-PINT. As exhibited, LINC-PINT repressed cell proliferation and cell colony formation of A549 and H1299 cells. Subsequently, flow cytometry evidenced that A549 and H1299 cell apoptosis was obviously triggered and the cell cycle was arrested in G1 phase. Then, migration and transwell invasion experiments were carried out to detect the cell migration and invasion capacity. We found A549 and H1299 cell migration and invasion capacity were restrained by the upregulation of LINC-PINT. Meanwhile, we predicted that miR-543 could function as the target of LINC-PINT and the association was verified. Moreover, we exhibited that miR-543 was remarkably increased in lung cancer, which could be regulated by LINC-PINT negatively. Furthermore, PTEN could act as the downstream target of miR-543 and upregulation of miR-543 repressed PTEN, which was reversed by LV-PINT in A549 and H1299 cells. Finally, xenografts were utilized to confirm the function of LINC-PINT on lung cancer. All these findings concluded that LINC-PINT exerted crucial biological roles in NSCLC through sponging miR-543 and inducing PTEN."

Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities.

Relationships between radiation exposure and risks of first and second primary cancers were quantified using Poisson regression. There was a similar linear dose-response relationship between radiation exposure and risks of both first and second primary solid tumors [excess relative risk (ERR)/Gy = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.74 and ERR/Gy = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80, respectively] and risk of both first and second primary leukemias (ERR/Gy = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.78-3.78 and ERR/Gy = 3.65; 95% CI, 0.96-10.70, respectively). Background incidence rates were higher for second solid cancers, compared with first solid cancers, until about age 70 years for men and 80 years for women (P < 0.0001), but radiation-related ERRs did not differ between first and second primary solid cancers (P = 0.70). Radiation dose was most strongly related to risk of solid tumors that are radiation-sensitive including second primary lung, colon, female breast, thyroid, and bladder cancers. Radiation exposure confers equally high relative risks of second primary cancers as first primary cancers. Radiation is a potent carcinogen and those with substantial exposures who are diagnosed with a first primary cancer should be carefully screened for second primary cancers, particularly for cancers that are radiation-sensitive."

Here, we show evidence that TORC1 directly regulates G1/S transition via MBF and SBF. Various proteins involved in G1/S transition, including Mbp1 and Swi4, but not Swi6, were largely lost after rapamycin treatment. TORC1 inactivation facilitated degradation of Mbp1 and Swi4. Mbp1 degradation was dependent on Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF)-Grr1 and proteasomes. We identified a PEST-like degron in Mbp1. Mutant cells with an unstable Mbp1 protein were hypersensitive to rapamycin and more accumulated G1 cells in the absence and presence of rapamycin.

Despite the unprecedented success achieved, the limitations of mAbs, including poor tissue and tumor penetration, long half-life time, poor oral bioavailability, and expensive production costs, impelled researchers to turn their attention to the development of peptide-based and non-peptide small-molecule inhibitors as potential alternatives or supplements to mAbs.

The AhR agonist, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), significantly decreased the LSC proportion and clonogenicity and increased differentiation markers in AML primary cells. Synergistic/additive effects of FICZ and gilteritinib, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor, were confirmed in AML cells with FLT3-ITD. We present evidence that combination of both agents inhibits FLT3 downstream molecules and degrades clonogenicity.

Mutations in the HLXB9 gene have been suggested to be the genetic background of CS. In this study, sequence analysis of the HLXB9 gene was performed in two familial and two sporadic Korean patients showing the clinical features of CS, and two mutations in the HLXB9 gene were identified only in the two familial cases. One mutation (R295W) has been reported previously, and the other (H260_Q261delinsLELLELE) is novel. Consistent with previous observations, the phenotypic expression of the mutation carriers in the CS families varies from mild to severe, including the complete triad. This study confirms that familial CS patients in Korea have the same genetic background as other ethnicities and reaffirms the phenotype variability among CS patients with the same mutation."

Here, we assess epigenetic mechanisms associated with Runx2/p57 gene transcription in differentiating MC3T3 mouse osteoblasts. Our results show that an enrichment of activating histone marks at the Runx2/p57 P1 promoter is accompanied by the simultaneous interaction of Wdr5 and Utx proteins, both are components of COMPASS complexes. Knockdown of Wdr5 and Utx expression confirms the activating role of both proteins at the Runx2-P1 promoter. Other chromatin modifiers that were previously described to regulate Runx2/p57 transcription in mesenchymal precursor cells (Ezh2, Prmt5, and Jarid1b proteins) were not found to contribute to Runx2/p57 transcription in full-committed osteoblasts. We also determined the presence of additional components of COMPASS complexes at the Runx2/p57 promoter, evidencing that the Mll2/COMPASS-\u00a0and Mll3/COMPASS-like complexes bind to the P1 promoter in osteoblastic cells expressing Runx2/p57 to modulate the H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 transition."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several significant loci associated with schizophrenia. However, the explained heritability is still low. Growing evidence has shown schizophrenia is attributable to multiple genes with moderate effects. In-depth mining and integration of GWAS data is urgently expected to uncover disease-related gene combination patterns. Network-based analysis is a promising strategy to better interpret GWAS to identify disease-related network modules. We performed a network-based analysis on three independent schizophrenia GWASs by using a refined analysis framework, which included a more accurate gene P-value calculation, dynamic network module searching algorithm and detailed functional analysis for the obtained modules genes. The result generated 79 modules including 238 genes, which form a highly connected subnetwork with more statistical significance than expected by chance. The result validated several reported disease genes, such as MAD1L1, MCC, SDCCAG8, VAT1L, MAPK14, MYH9 and FXYD6, and also obtained several novel candidate genes and gene-gene interactions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the module genes suggested they were enriched in several neural and immune system related pathways/GO terms, such as neurotrophin signaling pathway, synaptosome, regulation of protein ubiquitination, and antigen processing and presentation. Further crosstalk analysis revealed these pathways/GO terms were cooperated with each other, and identified several important genes, which might play vital roles to connect these functions. Our network-based analysis of schizophrenia GWASs will facilitate the understanding of genetic mechanisms of schizophrenia. "

The simultaneous accumulation of different proteins is a common event in many neurodegenerative diseases. We herein describe the detection of the phosphorylation and dimerization of \u03b1Syn and activation of GSK-3\u03b2, a major kinase known to phosphorylate tau and \u03b1Syn, in the brains of rTg4510 mice that overexpress human P301L mutant tau. Immunohistochemistry showed p-\u03b1Syn aggregates in rTg4510 mice, which were suppressed by doxycycline-mediated decreases in mutant tau expression levels. A semi-quantitative analysis revealed a regional correlation between hp-tau and p-\u03b1Syn accumulation in rTg4510 mice. Furthermore, proteinase K-resistant \u03b1Syn aggregates were found in the region with excessive hp-tau accumulation in rTg4510 mice, and these aggregates were morphologically different from proteinase K-susceptible p-\u03b1Syn aggregates. Western blotting revealed decreases in p-\u03b1Syn monomers in TBS- and sarkosyl-soluble fractions and increases in ubiquitinated p-\u03b1Syn dimers in sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble fractions in rTg4510 mice. Furthermore, an activated form of GSK-3\u03b2 was immunohistochemically detected within cells containing both hp-tau and p-\u03b1Syn aggregates. A semi-quantitative analysis revealed that increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity strongly correlated with hp-tau and p-\u03b1Syn accumulation in rTg4510 mice. Collectively, the present results suggest that the overexpression of human P301L mutant tau promoted the phosphorylation and dimerization of endogenous \u03b1Syn by activating GSK-3\u03b2 in rTg4510 mice. This synergic effect between tau, \u03b1Syn, and GSK-3\u03b2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases that show the accumulation of both tau and \u03b1Syn."

Macaques were treated with water with DSS for two weeks followed by water without DSS for two weeks. Disease activity was classified according to a modified Mayo score: stool consistency, rectal bleeding, colonoscopy examination and global assessment. Findings on colonoscopy were further graded according the Rachmilewitz EI. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the modified Mayo score and EI to therapeutic intervention, macaques were treated with the anti-inflammatory steroid prednisolone followed eight weeks later by the integrin antibody vedolizumab. Before DSS treatment, normal stool consistency and no rectal bleeding were observed. Colonoscopy demonstrated no mucosal abnormalities. Following the first DSS treatment, Mayo score and EI indicated signs of mild colitis. Following subsequent DSS treatments, mild to moderate colitis emerged with each DSS treatment and reduced signs of colitis were observed 2 weeks after DSS treatment termination. Prednisolone treatment during DSS treatment suppressed the emergence of colitis. Vedolizumab reduced signs of colitis during DSS treatment and further reduced signs of colitis that persisted after termination of DSS treatment. The current study demonstrated the potential of utilizing clinical outcome measures to assess experimentally-induced colitis in the macaque. Furthermore, signs of colitis, as assessed with the current methods, were reduced following therapeutic treatment.

Alzheimer's disease is considered to be associated with the dyshomeostasis of metal ions such as aluminum, zinc, copper, and ferric ions. Tau is predominately acetylated at the K274 residue in Alzheimer's disease, and the acetylation of the K274 residue is thought to be linked with dementia. Using acetyl mimicking K274Q mutation in tau, we have examined the effects of the acetylation at K274 residue of tau on the interactions of tau with metal ions and also on the ability of tau to protect DNA from the heat and other stressors. We found that Zn"

Overexpression of MCL-1 is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis; thus, MCL-1 inhibitors are rational therapeutic options for malignancies depending on MCL-1. Several MCL-1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, including AZD5991, S64315, AMG 176, and AMG 397. A key area of investigation is whether MCL-1 inhibitors will complement the activity of BCL-2 inhibitors, such as venetoclax, and synergistically enhance anti-tumor efficacy when given in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. Another important question is whether a safe therapeutic window can be found for this new class of inhibitors. In summary, inhibition of MCL-1 shows potential as a treatment for hematologic malignancies and clinical evaluation of MCL-1 inhibitors is currently underway."

Further progress in reducing the burden of disease is inhibited, in part, by vaccine underperformance in certain settings. Early trials suggested that oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), when administered concomitantly with rotavirus vaccine, reduces rotavirus seroconversion rates after the first rotavirus dose with modest or nonsignificant interference after completion of the full rotavirus vaccine course. Our study aimed to identify a range of individual-level characteristics, including concomitant receipt of OPV, that affect rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity in high- and low-child-mortality settings, controlling for individual- and country-level factors. Our central hypothesis was that OPV administered concomitantly with rotavirus vaccine reduced rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, distribution of which may indicate the risk of different human organs vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies investigating the distribution of ACE2 mRNA in human tissues only involved a limited size of the samples and a lack of determination for ACE2 protein. Given the heterogeneity among humans, the datasets covering more tissues with a larger size of samples should be analyzed. Indeed, ACE2 is a membrane and secreted protein, while the expression of ACE2 in blood and common blood cells remains unknown. Herein, the proteomic data in HIPED and the antibody-based immunochemistry result in HPA were collected to analyze the distribution of ACE2 protein in human tissues. The bulk RNA-seq profiles from three separate public datasets including HPA tissue Atlas, GTEx, and FANTOM5 CAGE were also obtained to determine the expression of ACE2 in human tissues. Moreover, the abundance of ACE2 in human blood and blood cells was determined by analyzing the data in the PeptideAtlas and the HPA Blood Atlas. We found that the mRNA expression cannot reflect the abundance of ACE2 factor due to the strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities of ACE2 within and across tissues. Our results suggested that ACE2 protein is mainly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, gallbladder, and testis, while the abundance of which in brain-associated tissues and blood common cells is low. HIPED revealed enrichment of ACE2 protein in the placenta and ovary despite a low mRNA level. Further, human secretome shows that the average concentration of ACE2 protein in the plasma of males is higher than those in females. Our research will be beneficial for understanding the transmission routes and sex-based differences in susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
