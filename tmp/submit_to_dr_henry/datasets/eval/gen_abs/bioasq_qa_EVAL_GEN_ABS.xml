Napoli, December 1st-4th 2015.</Title><Abstract>The sixth "Melanoma Bridge Meeting" took place in Naples, Italy, December 1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Biomarkers, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Biomedical Research</MeSH><MeSH>Clinical Trials as Topic</MeSH><MeSH>Combined Modality Therapy</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Italy</MeSH><MeSH>Melanoma</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Microenvironment</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

In-beam PET monitoring has been already performed using inter-spill and post-irradiation data, i.e. while the particle beam is off or paused. The full beam acquisition procedure is commonly discarded because the particle spills abruptly increase the random coincidence rates and therefore the image noise. This is because random coincidences cannot be separated by annihilation photons originating from radioactive decays and cannot be corrected with standard random coincidence techniques due to the time correlation of the beam-induced background with the ion beam microstructure. The aim of this paper is to provide a new method to recover in-spill data to improve the images obtained with full-beam PET acquisitions. This is done by estimating the temporal microstructure of the beam and thus selecting input PET events that are less likely to be random ones. The PET detector we used was the one developed within the INSIDE project and tested at the CNAO synchrotron-based facility. The data were taken on a PMMA phantom irradiated with 72 MeV proton pencil beams. The obtained results confirm the possibility of improving the acquired PET data without any external signal coming from the synchrotron or ad hoc detectors.</Abstract><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Positron-Emission Tomography</MeSH><MeSH>Proton Therapy</MeSH><MeSH>Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Radiotherapy, Image-Guided</MeSH><MeSH>Safety</MeSH><MeSH>Synchrotrons</MeSH><MeSH>Uncertainty</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>particles Hadron therapy</QueryUsed><Result PMID="27242956"><Journal>Frontiers in oncology</Journal><Year>2016</Year><Title>The FLUKA Code: An Accurate Simulation Tool for Particle Therapy.</Title><Abstract>Monte Carlo (MC) codes are increasingly spreading in the hadrontherapy community due to their detailed description of radiation transport and interaction with matter. The suitability of a MC code for application to hadrontherapy demands accurate and reliable physical models capable of handling all components of the expected radiation field. This becomes extremely important for correctly performing not only physical but also biologically based dose calculations, especially in cases where ions heavier than protons are involved. In addition, accurate prediction of emerging secondary radiation is of utmost importance in innovative areas of research aiming at in vivo treatment verification. This contribution will address the recent developments of the FLUKA MC code and its practical applications in this field. Refinements of the FLUKA nuclear models in the therapeutic energy interval lead to an improved description of the mixed radiation field as shown in the presented benchmarks against experimental data with both (4)He and (12)C ion beams. Accurate description of ionization energy losses and of particle scattering and interactions lead to the excellent agreement of calculated depth-dose profiles with those measured at leading European hadron therapy centers, both with proton and ion beams. In order to support the application of FLUKA in hospital-based environments, Flair, the FLUKA graphical interface, has been enhanced with the capability of translating CT DICOM images into voxel-based computational phantoms in a fast and well-structured way. The interface is capable of importing also radiotherapy treatment data described in DICOM RT standard. In addition, the interface is equipped with an intuitive PET scanner geometry generator and automatic recording of coincidence events. Clinically, similar cases will be presented both in terms of absorbed dose and biological dose calculations describing the various available features. </Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

A LACE index&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;10 is considered as high risk in the existing literature. We aimed&#160;to derive age-specific LACE index thresholds in the prediction of mortality and frequent readmissions. Analysis of prospectively collected data of consecutive alive-discharge episodes between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019 to a single hospital&#160;was conducted. The derivation of LACE index thresholds for predicting all-cause mortality within 6 months of hospital discharge or frequent readmissions (&#8805;&#8201;2 times within 28&#160;days) was examined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) in 32270 patients (14878 men, 17392 women) aged 18-107 year (mean&#8201;=&#8201;64.0 years, SD&#8201;=&#8201;20.5). For all patients with a LACE index&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;10, the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting mortality was 80.5% (95% CI 79.7-81.3) and for frequent readmissions was 84.0% (83.0-85.1). Two-graph ROC plots showed that the LACE index threshold where sensitivity equates specificity was 9.5 (95% intermediate range&#8201;=&#8201;5.6-13.5) for predicting mortality and 10.3 (95% intermediate range&#8201;=&#8201;6.6-13.6) for frequent readmissions. These thresholds were lowest among youngest individuals and rose progressively with age for mortality prediction: 18-49 years&#8201;=&#8201;5.0, 50-59 years&#8201;=&#8201;6.5, 60-69 years&#8201;=&#8201;8.0, 70-79 years&#8201;=&#8201;9.8 and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;80 years&#8201;=&#8201;11.6, and similarly for frequent readmissions: 18-49 years&#8201;=&#8201;5.1, 50-59 years&#8201;=&#8201;7.5, 60-69 years&#8201;=&#8201;9.1, 70-79 years&#8201;=&#8201;10.6 and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;80 years&#8201;=&#8201;12.0. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) ranged 1.5-3.3 and 0.4-0.6 for predicting mortality, and 2.5-4.4 and 0.3-0.6 for frequent readmissions, respectively, with stronger evidence in younger than in older individuals (LRs further from unity). In conclusion,&#160;the LACE index predicts mortality and frequent readmissions at lower thresholds and stronger in younger than in older individuals. Age should be taken into account when using the LACE index for identifying patients at high risk.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>LACE Index</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32619899"><Journal>Clinical neurology and neurosurgery</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Predicting short-term outcomes following supratentorial tumor surgery.</Title><Abstract>The LACE+ index risk prediction tool has not been successfully used to predict short-term outcomes after neurosurgery.

However, these vehicles affect not only drug bioavailability, but may also have an impact on gastric emptying, drug disposition, lymphatic absorption and are affected by lipid digestion mechanisms. The work presented here compared pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) in sesame oil vs. a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS). This investigation was conducted with a unique tool termed the "absorption cocktail approach". In this concept, selected molecules: metoprolol, THC and ibuprofen were co-administered with CBD in SNEDDS and sesame oil. This method was used to shed light on the complex absorption process of poorly soluble drugs in-vivo, specifically assessing absorption kinetics of CBD. It was found that the concentration vs. time curve following CBD-sesame oil oral administration showed extended input of the drug with delayed Tmax compared to CBD-SNEDDS. Using the "cocktail" approach, a unique finding was observed when the less lipophilic compounds (metoprolol and ibuprofen) exited the stomach much earlier than the lipophilic cannabinoids in sesame oil, proving differential absorption kinetics. Findings of the absorption cocktail approach reflected the physiological process of the GI e.g gastric retention, stomach content separation, lipid digestion, drug precipitation and more, demonstrating its utility. Nonetheless, the search for more compounds as suitable molecule probes is underway.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Aside from cancer, concerns have been raised about late degenerative risks, including effects on the brain. In this study we examined the effects of (56)Fe particle irradiation in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrated 6 months after exposure to 10 and 100 cGy (56)Fe radiation at 1 GeV/&#181;, that APP/PS1 mice show decreased cognitive abilities measured by contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition tests. Furthermore, in male mice we saw acceleration of A&#946; plaque pathology using Congo red and 6E10 staining, which was further confirmed by ELISA measures of A&#946; isoforms. Increases were not due to higher levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or increased cleavage as measured by levels of the &#946; C-terminal fragment of APP. Additionally, we saw no change in microglial activation levels judging by CD68 and Iba-1 immunoreactivities in and around A&#946; plaques or insulin degrading enzyme, which has been shown to degrade A&#946;. However, immunohistochemical analysis of ICAM-1 showed evidence of endothelial activation after 100 cGy irradiation in male mice, suggesting possible alterations in A&#946; trafficking through the blood brain barrier as a possible cause of plaque increase. Overall, our results show for the first time that HZE particle radiation can increase A&#946; plaque pathology in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD.</Abstract><MeSH>Alzheimer Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Amyloid beta-Peptides</MeSH><MeSH>Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Brain</MeSH><MeSH>Cognition Disorders</MeSH><MeSH>Cosmic Radiation</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Models, Animal</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Plaque, Amyloid</MeSH><MeSH>Presenilin-1</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Identification and understanding of novel PPIs would facilitate the discovery of new biological models and therapeutic targets for clinical intervention. Numerous resources and PPI databases have been developed to define a global interactome through the PPI data mining, curation, and integration of different types of experimental evidence obtained with various methods in different model systems. On the other hand, the recent advances in cancer genomics and proteomics have revealed a critical role of genomic alterations in acquisition of cancer hallmarks through a dysregulated network of oncogenic PPIs. Deciphering of cancer-specific interactome would uncover new mechanisms of oncogenic signaling for therapeutic interrogation. Toward this goal our team has developed a high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. The established network of oncogenic PPIs, termed the OncoPPi network, is available through the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows to access and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines integrated with the analysis of mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins, domain-domain interactions, and therapeutic connectivity. This chapter presents a guide to explore the OncoPPi network using the OncoPPi Portal to facilitate cancer biology.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>portal protein-protein interactions cancer cell lines</QueryUsed><Result PMID="29525205"><Journal>Cell systems</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>The Genomic Landscape and Pharmacogenomic Interactions of Clock Genes in Cancer Chronotherapy.</Title><Abstract>Cancer chronotherapy, treatment at specific times during circadian rhythms, endeavors to optimize anti-tumor effects and to lower toxicity. However, comprehensive characterization of clock genes and their clinical relevance in cancer is lacking. We systematically characterized the alterations of clock genes across 32 cancer types by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, and The Genomics of&#160;Drug Sensitivity in Cancer databases. Expression alterations of clock genes are associated with key oncogenic pathways, patient survival, tumor stage, and subtype in multiple cancer types.&#160;Correlations between expression of clock genes and of other genes in the genome were altered in cancerous versus normal tissues. We identified interactions between clock genes and clinically actionable genes by analyzing co-expression, protein-protein interaction, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data and also found that clock gene expression is correlated to anti-cancer drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the circadian clock across different cancer types and highlights potential clinical utility of cancer chronotherapy.</Abstract><MeSH>Chronotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Circadian Clocks</MeSH><MeSH>Circadian Rhythm</MeSH><MeSH>Genomics</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Pharmacogenetics</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>portal protein-protein interactions cancer cell lines</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32648580"><Journal>Bioscience reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Prognostic and immune regulating roles of YIF1B in Pan-Cancer: a potential target for both survival and therapy response evaluation.</Title><Abstract>The neurotransmitter, serotonin has emerged as a tumor growth factor and immune response regulator through complex signaling pathways.

Loss of this protein is associated with reduced complexities of neuronal dendrites and alterations in spine morphology in a number of cortical brain regions, and these deficits may underlie the cognitive impairment observed in fragile X patients. Among the many symptoms of fragile X are altered motor functions, although the neuronal basis for these remains unclear. In this study we investigated whether knockout of Fmr1 in the mouse model of fragile X altered dendrite morphology in developing spinal cord motor neurons. We find that Fmr1 knockout leads to modest alterations in the distribution of dendritic arbor across the span of the motor neuron dendritic tree in 2- and 4-week-old mice, compared to wild-type controls, consistent with slower rates of extension and abnormal pruning of intermediate dendritic segments. These studies suggest that some motor deficits in fragile X patients may be due to abnormal maturation of dendritic patterning within spinal motor neurons, and suggest that strategies aimed at preventing motor impairment in fragile X patients may be targeted at motor functions during early development.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Shape</MeSH><MeSH>Dendrites</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Models, Animal</MeSH><MeSH>Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Fragile X Syndrome</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental</MeSH><MeSH>Image Cytometry</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Knockout</MeSH><MeSH>Motor Neurons</MeSH><MeSH>Nervous System Malformations</MeSH><MeSH>Neurogenesis</MeSH><MeSH>Spinal Cord</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

The genetic basis for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML is not well characterized. We previously identified a candidate murine gene for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML (rAML): C-terminal binding protein (CTBP)-interacting protein (CTIP)/retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8). This gene is essential for embryonic development, double-strand break (DSB) resection in homologous recombination (HR) and tumor suppression. In the 129S2/SvHsd mouse strain, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) in Ctip, Q418P, has been identified. We investigated the role of Q418P in radiation-induced carcinogenesis and its effect on CTIP function in HR. After whole-body exposure to 3 Gy of X rays, 11 out of 113 (9.7%) 129S2/SvHsd mice developed rAML. Furthermore, 129S2/SvHsd mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed lower levels of recruitment of HR factors, Rad51 and replication protein A (RPA) to radiation-induced foci, compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6 MEFs, isolated from rAML-sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Mitomycin C and alpha particles induced lower levels of sister chromatid exchanges in 129S2/SvHsd cells compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6. Our data demonstrate that Q418P nsSNP influences the efficiency of CTIP function in HR repair of DNA DSBs in vitro and in vivo, and appears to affect susceptibility to rAML.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Carcinogenesis</MeSH><MeSH>Carrier Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Cycle Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Homologous Recombination</MeSH><MeSH>Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cells affected radiation-induced leukemias</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32573733"><Journal>Blood</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Hematopoietic stem cells acquire survival advantage by loss of RUNX1 methylation identified in familial leukemia.</Title><Abstract>RUNX1 is among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemia, and the loss or dominant-negative suppression of RUNX1 function is found in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, how post-translational modifications (PTMs) of RUNX1 affect its in vivo function and whether PTM dysregulation of RUNX1 can cause leukemia are largely unknown. We performed targeted deep sequencing on a family with 3 occurrences of AML and identified a novel RUNX1 mutation R237K. The mutated R237 residue is a methylation site by PRMT1 and loss of methylation has been reported to impair transcriptional activity of RUNX1 in vitro. To explore biological significance of RUNX1 methylation in vivo, we utilized RUNX1 R233K/R237K double mutant mice, in which 2 arginine-to-lysine mutations precluded RUNX1 methylation. Genetic ablation of RUNX1 methylation led to loss of quiescence and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and changed the genomic and epigenomic signature of phenotypic HSCs to a poised progenitor state. Further, loss of RUNX1 R233/R237 methylation suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced unfolded protein response genes including Atf4, Ddit3, and Gadd34, radiation-induced p53 downstream genes, Bbc3, Pmaip1, and Cdkn1a, and subsequent apoptosis in HSCs. Mechanistically, ATF4 was identified as a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. Collectively, defects in RUNX1 methylation in HSCs confer resistance to apoptosis and survival advantage under stress conditions, a hallmark of a pre-leukemic clone which may predispose affected individuals to leukemia. Our study will lead to a better understanding of how dysregulation of PTMs can contribute to leukemogenesis.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

A 14-yr-old male presented with a pulsatile scalp lesion that was first noticed 3 yr prior and had progressively enlarged. No history of trauma was reported. MRI demonstrated a 4 cm wide and 2 cm tall nidus and catheter angiography was performed to further define the vascular supply and drainage. The patient underwent transvenous endovascular embolization followed by surgical excision via a bicoronal incision, as shown in this operative video. Care was taken to identify, cauterize, and transect feeding vessels from the superficial temporal, supratrochlear, and supraorbital arteries circumferentially to completely devascularize and resect the galeal nidus from overlying scalp tissue and underlying pericranium. Previously unreported in the literature, transosseous emissary veins partially draining the lesion were noted on angiography and were waxed thoroughly during surgery. Six-month follow-up examination demonstrated a well-healed incision without evidence of AVM recurrence. The unique venous drainage of this cirsoid aneurysm highlights the value of diagnostic angiography to fully characterize these rare and complex vascular lesions prior to pursuing definitive treatment. &#8195;IRB approval was obtained from the Ann &amp; Robert H.

Here, we propose ASP-siRNA as a preferable choice to target duplicated disease genes, avoiding potentially harmful excessive downregulation. As a proof-of-concept, we studied autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) due to lamin B1 (LMNB1) duplication, a hereditary, progressive and fatal disorder affecting myelin in the CNS. Using a reporter system, we screened the most efficient ASP-siRNAs preferentially targeting one of the alleles at rs1051644 (average minor allele frequency: 0.45) located in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. We identified four siRNAs with a high efficacy and allele-specificity, which were tested in ADLD patient-derived fibroblasts. Three of the small interfering RNAs were highly selective for the target allele and restored both LMNB1 mRNA and protein levels close to control levels. Furthermore, small interfering RNA treatment abrogates the ADLD-specific phenotypes in fibroblasts and in two disease-relevant cellular models: murine oligodendrocytes overexpressing human LMNB1, and neurons directly reprogrammed from patients' fibroblasts. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ASP-silencing by RNA interference is a suitable and promising therapeutic option for ADLD.

We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease. The mechanisms by which increased LMNB1 levels cause ADLD are unclear. To address this, we used a transgenic mouse model where Lamin B1 overexpression is targeted to oligodendrocytes. These mice showed severe vacuolar degeneration of the spinal cord white matter together with marked astrogliosis, microglial infiltration, and secondary axonal damage. Oligodendrocytes in the transgenic mice revealed alterations in histone modifications favoring a transcriptionally repressed state. Chromatin changes were accompanied by reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis pathways, many of which are known to play important roles in myelin regulation and are preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes. Decreased lipogenic gene expression resulted in a significant reduction in multiple classes of lipids involved in myelin formation. Many of these gene expression changes and lipid alterations were observed even before the onset of the phenotype, suggesting a causal role. Our findings establish, for the first time, a link between LMNB1 and lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes, and provide a mechanistic framework to explain the age dependence and white matter involvement of the disease phenotype. These results have implications for disease pathogenesis and may also shed light on the regulation of lipid synthesis pathways in myelin maintenance and turnover.</Abstract><MeSH>Aging</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Demyelinating Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Lamin Type B</MeSH><MeSH>Lipid Metabolism</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Transgenic</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Lamina</MeSH><MeSH>Oligodendroglia</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

In addition, we demonstrate that TAP-seq can identify cell subtypes with only 100 sequencing reads per cell.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>Perturb-seq</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32513233"><Journal>Genome biology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Direct-seq:&#160;programmed gRNA scaffold for streamlined scRNA-seq in CRISPR screen.</Title><Abstract>CRISPR-based genome perturbation provides a new avenue to conveniently change DNA sequences, transcription, and epigenetic modifications in genetic screens. However, it remains challenging to assay the complex molecular readouts after perturbation at high resolution and at scale. By introducing an A/G mixed capture sequence into the gRNA scaffold, we demonstrate that gRNA transcripts could be directly reverse transcribed by poly (dT) primer together with the endogenous mRNA, followed by high-content molecular phenotyping in scRNA-seq&#160;(Direct-seq). With this method, the CRISPR perturbation and its transcriptional readouts can be profiled together in a streamlined workflow.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

However, research regarding sterilization of NOW larvae and pupae by gamma irradiation indicated nonsuitability due to high mortality. Here, NOW larvae and pupae were irradiated to doses up to 50 Gy with 90 keV x-rays, then paired with nonirradiated colony mates. Sterility of surviving insects was determined by the presence or absence of hatched neonates. While presence of offspring does not guarantee viability, the absence does guarantee sterility (as is appropriate for SIT) and was thus the measure used here. Early stage larvae experienced 77% mortality at a dose of 30 Gy, versus 20% for nonirradiated control. At 40 Gy, mortality reached 98%. Of surviving early stage larvae at 30 Gy, 29% of moth pairs produced offspring. For late stage larvae, no offspring were produced at 40 Gy, but mortality was 73%. For pupae, mortality reached 53% at 30 Gy with 13% still producing neonates, while mortality reached 98% at 40 Gy. These results are consistent with reported results for gamma irradiation of NOW larvae where sterility was observed somewhere between the 30 Gy and 60 Gy data points, but mortality was high. This further confirms the lack of suitability of NOW irradiated in the larval stage, whether by gamma or x-ray, and supports the hypothesis that x-ray and gamma treatments are biologically equivalent at equal doses.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>gamma sterilization</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32067198"><Journal>Cell and tissue banking</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Investigation of the mechanism of gamma irradiation effect on bovine bone.</Title><Abstract>Radiation sterilization is an effective method of bone sterilization prior to bone graft transplantation. Gamma irradiation affects the biological and mechanical properties of bone; depending on the dose of radiation. The effect of gamma irradiation on bone mechanical properties is an unwanted phenomenon. However the mechanism of the effect of irradiation on bone mechanical properties is not properly understood. In this research paper the mechanism of the effect of gamma irradiation on bovine bone is investigated using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-rays spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Gamma irradiation affects the mineral and fiber composition of bovine bone. The mineral content of bone especially calcium, magnesium and phosphorus decrease with increasing dose of gamma radiation. At Nano-level gamma irradiation alter amide I, amide II and amide III collagen contents. High dose gamma irradiation induces collagen cross-linking reaction in bone and degrades bone properties.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Microarray technology is the driving force of this revolution, a technology that allows the simultaneous monitoring of expression for thousands of genes. The need for accurate and reproducible research has driven the development of robust analysis frameworks for maximizing the information content of biological data. In microarray imaging technologies, several non-linearities in the experimental process render the measured expression values prone to variability and often, to poor reproducibility. Accurate segmentation of the true signal is a very important task, not least because a single value per spot needs to be derived for further knowledge discovery analysis. In this paper, we present a fully automatic segmentation method for improving the spot segmentation result. The method doesn't make any assumptions concerning the number of classes present in each image spot, and it isn't driven only by the most intense features, since it takes into account the underlying "hybridization ground truth" derived from both information channels of the spotted arrays. Our method is compared to widely used, state-of-the-art segmentation methods in microarray image analysis in a study of a metabolic disorder in yeast, where replicates of reporters are present. Initial results indicate that our method yields more reproducible log ratio measurements across replicates.</Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Bayes Theorem</MeSH><MeSH>Cluster Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Nucleic Acid Hybridization</MeSH><MeSH>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Pattern Recognition, Automated</MeSH><MeSH>Software</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>methods genome segmentation gene expression data</QueryUsed><Result PMID="17946341"><Journal>Conference proceedings : ...

In microarray imaging technologies, several non-linearities in the experimental process render the measured expression values prone to variability and often, to poor reproducibility. Accurate segmentation of the true signal is a very important task, not least because a single value per spot needs to be derived for further knowledge discovery analysis. In this paper, we present a fully automatic segmentation method for improving the spot segmentation result. The method doesn't make any assumptions concerning the number of classes present in each image spot, and it isn't driven only by the most intense features, since it takes into account the underlying "hybridization ground truth" derived from both information channels of the spotted arrays. Our method is compared to widely used, state-of-the-art segmentation methods in microarray image analysis in a study of a metabolic disorder in yeast, where replicates of reporters are present. Initial results indicate that our method yields more reproducible log ratio measurements across replicates.</Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Bayes Theorem</MeSH><MeSH>Cluster Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</MeSH><MeSH>Nucleic Acid Hybridization</MeSH><MeSH>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Pattern Recognition, Automated</MeSH><MeSH>Software</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>methods genome segmentation gene expression data</QueryUsed><Result PMID="25677182"><Journal>Genome research</Journal><Year>2015</Year><Title>Joint annotation of chromatin state and chromatin conformation reveals relationships among domain types and identifies domains of cell-type-specific expression.</Title><Abstract>The genomic neighborhood of a gene influences its activity, a behavior that is attributable in part to domain-scale regulation. Previous genomic studies have identified many types of regulatory domains. However, due to the difficulty of integrating genomics data sets, the relationships among these domain types are poorly understood. Semi-automated genome annotation (SAGA) algorithms facilitate human interpretation of heterogeneous collections of genomics data by simultaneously partitioning the human genome and assigning labels to the resulting genomic segments. However, existing SAGA methods cannot integrate inherently pairwise chromatin conformation data. We developed a new computational method, called graph-based regularization (GBR), for expressing a pairwise prior that encourages certain pairs of genomic loci to receive the same label in a genome annotation. We used GBR to exploit chromatin conformation information during genome annotation by encouraging positions that are close in 3D to occupy the same type of domain. Using this approach, we produced a model of chromatin domains in eight human cell types, thereby revealing the relationships among known domain types. Through this model, we identified clusters of tightly regulated genes expressed in only a small number of cell types, which we term "specific expression domains." We found that domain boundaries marked by promoters and CTCF motifs are consistent between cell types even when domain activity changes. Finally, we showed that GBR can be used to transfer information from well-studied cell types to less well-characterized cell types during genome annotation, making it possible to produce high-quality annotations of the hundreds of cell types with limited available data. </Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Amino Acid Motifs</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosome Structures</MeSH><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Genome, Human</MeSH><MeSH>Genomics</MeSH><MeSH>HeLa Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Hep G2 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Conformation</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Annotation</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>methods genome segmentation gene expression data</QueryUsed><Result PMID="12185276"><Journal>The Journal of general virology</Journal><Year>2002</Year><Title>Cloning of complete genome sets of six dsRNA viruses using an improved cloning method for large dsRNA genes.</Title><Abstract>Cloning full-length large (&gt;3 kb) dsRNA genome segments from small amounts of dsRNA has thus far remained problematic. Here, a single-primer amplification sequence-independent dsRNA cloning procedure was perfected for large genes and tailored for routine use to clone complete genome sets or individual genes. Nine complete viral genome sets were amplified by PCR, namely those of two human rotaviruses, two African horsesickness viruses (AHSV), two equine encephalosis viruses (EEV), one bluetongue virus (BTV), one reovirus and bacteriophage Phi12. Of these amplified genomes, six complete genome sets were cloned for viruses with genes ranging in size from 0.8 to 6.8 kb. Rotavirus dsRNA was extracted directly from stool samples. Co-expressed EEV VP3 and VP7 assembled into core-like particles that have typical orbivirus capsomeres. This work presents the first EEV sequence data and establishes that EEV genes have the same conserved termini (5' GUU and UAC 3') and coding assignment as AHSV and BTV. To clone complete genome sets, one-tube reactions were developed for oligo-ligation, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification. The method is simple and efficient compared to other methods. Complete genomes can be cloned from as little as 1 ng dsRNA and a considerably reduced number of PCR cycles (22-30 cycles compared to 30-35 of other methods). This progress with cloning large dsRNA genes is important for recombinant vaccine development and determination of the role of terminal sequences for replication and gene expression.</Abstract><MeSH>African Horse Sickness Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Cloning, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Cystoviridae</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Complementary</MeSH><MeSH>Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Double-Stranded</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Reoviridae</MeSH><MeSH>Terminal Repeat Sequences</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>methods genome segmentation gene expression data</QueryUsed><Result PMID="25817355"><Journal>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</Journal><Year>2015</Year><Title>Deep Sequencing in Microdissected Renal Tubules Identifies Nephron Segment-Specific Transcriptomes.</Title><Abstract>The function of each renal tubule segment depends on the genes expressed therein. High-throughput methods used for global profiling of gene expression in unique cell types have shown low sensitivity and high false positivity, thereby limiting the usefulness of these methods in transcriptomic research. However, deep sequencing of RNA species (RNA-seq) achieves highly sensitive and quantitative transcriptomic profiling by sequencing RNAs in a massive, parallel manner. Here, we used RNA-seq coupled with classic renal tubule microdissection to comprehensively profile gene expression in each of 14 renal tubule segments from the proximal tubule through the inner medullary collecting duct of rat kidneys. Polyadenylated mRNAs were captured by oligo-dT primers and processed into adapter-ligated cDNA libraries that were sequenced using an Illumina platform. Transcriptomes were identified to a median depth of 8261 genes in microdissected renal tubule samples (105 replicates in total) and glomeruli (5 replicates). Manual microdissection allowed a high degree of sample purity, which was evidenced by the observed distributions of well established cell-specific markers. The main product of this work is an extensive database of gene expression along the nephron provided as a publicly accessible webpage (https://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/NephronRNAseq/index.html). The data also provide genome-wide maps of alternative exon usage and polyadenylation sites in the kidney. We illustrate the use of the data by profiling transcription factor expression along the renal tubule and mapping metabolic pathways. </Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cluster Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Exons</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Library</MeSH><MeSH>High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing</MeSH><MeSH>Kidney Medulla</MeSH><MeSH>Kidney Tubules</MeSH><MeSH>Kidney Tubules, Collecting</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Nephrons</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH><MeSH>Rats, Sprague-Dawley</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Analysis, RNA</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptome</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

TED can lead to facial disfigurement and severely impact patients' quality of life. Although the course of TED was identified over 60 years ago, effective treatment options have proved to be challenging. Current treatments such as glucocorticoid therapy and orbital radiation focus on reducing orbital inflammation. However, these therapies fail to modify the disease outcomes, including proptosis and diplopia. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of TED have facilitated the development of targeted molecular therapies such as teprotumumab, an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibiting monoclonal antibody. In recent phase 2 and phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials, teprotumumab rapidly achieved improvement in clinical endpoints defining TED, including improved proptosis and diplopia. Dramatic improvement in clinical outcomes achieved after teprotumumab therapy during active TED are heretofore singular and comparable only to surgical therapies achieved during the inactive phase of TED. The advent of effective medical therapy can lead to a paradigm shift in the clinical management of TED. This review will provide an overview of TED, its epidemiology, insight into the molecular biology of the disease, clinical characteristics and diagnosis, and current and emerging treatment modalities.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>receptor inhibited Teprotumumab</QueryUsed><Result PMID="29273685"><Journal>Journal of molecular endocrinology</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>IGF1 receptor and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.</Title><Abstract>Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a vexing and poorly understood autoimmune process involving the upper face and tissues surrounding the eyes. In TAO, the orbit can become inflamed and undergo substantial remodeling that is disfiguring and can lead to loss of vision. There are currently no approved medical therapies for TAO, the consequence of its uncertain pathogenic nature. It usually presents as a component of the syndrome known as Graves' disease where loss of immune tolerance to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) results in the generation of activating antibodies against that protein and hyperthyroidism. The role for TSHR and these antibodies in the development of TAO is considerably less well established. We have reported over the past 2 decades evidence that the insulin-like growth factorI receptor (IGF1R) may also participate in the pathogenesis of TAO. Activating antibodies against IGF1R have been detected in patients with GD. The actions of these antibodies initiate signaling in orbital fibroblasts from patients with the disease. Further, we have identified a functional and physical interaction between TSHR and IGF1R. Importantly, it appears that signaling initiated from either receptor can be attenuated by inhibiting the activity of IGF1R. These findings underpin the rationale for therapeutically targeting IGF1R in active TAO. A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug. It is possible that other autoimmune diseases might also benefit from this treatment strategy.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized</MeSH><MeSH>Graves Ophthalmopathy</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Receptor, IGF Type 1</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Thyrotropin</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>receptor inhibited Teprotumumab</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30215690"><Journal>Endocrine reviews</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Receptor and Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.</Title><Abstract>Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a complex disease process presumed to emerge from autoimmunity occurring in the thyroid gland, most frequently in Graves disease (GD).

In culture, both ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum skin fibroblasts show increased synthesis and secretion of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen. To determine whether these differences in protein production result from fundamental abnormalities in regulation of genes associated with cellular interactions, we compared the effects of trifluoperazine and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on expression of the extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, procollagenase and prostromelysin, by normal, ataxia-telangiectasia, and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. After trifluoperazine treatment the overall levels of these metalloproteinases were much greater in three ataxia-telangiectasia cell strains and in cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A and D than in normal cells. In contrast, cells from xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C produced only slightly more procollagenase than normal cells. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also induced higher than normal levels of procollagenase in some ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum strains, but less than that induced by trifluoperazine. Because increased extracellular accumulation of matrix-degrading enzymes has long been implicated in metastatic progression, this altered expression of procollagenase and prostromelysin in ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum cells could play an important role in the pathogenesis of various tumors in individuals with these genetic diseases.</Abstract><MeSH>Ataxia Telangiectasia</MeSH><MeSH>Collagenases</MeSH><MeSH>Enzyme Precursors</MeSH><MeSH>Fibroblasts</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Microbial Collagenase</MeSH><MeSH>Skin</MeSH><MeSH>Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate</MeSH><MeSH>Trifluoperazine</MeSH><MeSH>Xeroderma Pigmentosum</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32047639"><Journal>Human genome variation</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>A novel nonsense mutation of </Title><Abstract>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group D, a severe disease often typified by extreme sun sensitivity, can be caused by </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32047639"><Journal>Human genome variation</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>A novel nonsense mutation of </Title><Abstract>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group D, a severe disease often typified by extreme sun sensitivity, can be caused by </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum</QueryUsed><Result PMID="7963692"><Journal>The Journal of investigative dermatology</Journal><Year>1994</Year><Title>Xeroderma pigmentosum and related disorders: examining the linkage between defective DNA repair and cancer.</Title><Abstract>Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, the xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex, and trichothiodystrophy cells have defects in DNA repair and are associated with clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UV).

Recently, reduced cancer mortality following bariatric surgery has been reported. This study tested whether reduced cancer mortality following gastric bypass was due to decreased incidence. Cancer incidence and mortality data through 2007 from the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR) were compared between 6,596 Utah patients who had gastric bypass (1984-2002) and 9,442 severely obese persons who had applied for Utah Driver's Licenses (1984-2002). Study outcomes included incidence, case-fatality, and mortality for cancer by site and stage at diagnosis of all gastric bypass patients, compared to nonoperated severely obese controls. Follow-up was over a 24-year period (mean 12.5 years). Total cancer incidence was significantly lower in the surgical group compared to controls (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.65-0.89; P = 0.0006). Lower incidence in surgery patients vs. controls was primarily due to decreased incidence of cancer diagnosed at regional or distant stages. Cancer mortality was 46% lower in the surgery group compared to controls (HR = 0.54; CI 95%, 0.37-0.78; P = 0.001). Although the apparent protective effect of surgery on risk of developing cancer was limited to cancers likely known to be obesity related, the inverse association for mortality was seen for all cancers. Significant reduction in total cancer mortality in gastric bypass patients compared with severely obese controls was associated with decreased incidence, primarily among subjects with advanced cancers. These findings suggest gastric bypass results in lower cancer risk, presumably related to weight loss, supporting recommendations for reducing weight to lower cancer risk.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Case-Control Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gastric Bypass</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Incidence</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Obesity, Morbid</MeSH><MeSH>Proportional Hazards Models</MeSH><MeSH>Risk Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Utah</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but results in the majority of cases of de novo mutations. The disease is related to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) gene encoding one member of the FGFR subfamily of tyrosine kinase receptors, which results in constitutive activation of the receptor. Biochemical studies of FGFR3 combined with experiments in knock-out mice have demonstrated that FGFR3 is a negative regulator of chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation in growth plate. This mutation induces a disturbance of endochondral bone formation. The diagnosis of achondroplasia is based on typical clinical and radiological features including short stature, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia and rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. The most common rheumatological complications of achondroplasia are medullar and radicular compressions due to spinal stenosis and deformities of the lower limbs. Current treatment and future therapies are discussed.</Abstract><MeSH>Achondroplasia</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Chondrocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Models, Animal</MeSH><MeSH>Genotype</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Knockout</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Osteogenesis</MeSH><MeSH>Phenotype</MeSH><MeSH>Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Some structures are always present, such as nuclear speckles that contain RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and poly(A)+ RNAs. Others, like cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) that harbor mRNAs and RBPs, are induced upon stress. When we examined the formation and composition of nuclear speckles during stress induction with tubercidin, an adenosine analogue previously shown to affect nuclear speckle composition, we unexpectedly found that it also led to the formation of SGs and to the inhibition of several crucial steps of RNA metabolism in cells, thereby serving as a potent inhibitor of the gene expression pathway. Although transcription and splicing persisted under this stress, RBPs and mRNAs were mislocalized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Specifically, lncRNA and RBP localization to nuclear speckles was disrupted, exon junction complex (EJC) recruitment to mRNA was reduced, mRNA export was obstructed, and cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNAs localized in SGs. Furthermore, nuclear proteins that participate in mRNA export, such as nucleoporins and mRNA export adaptors, were mislocalized to SGs. This study reveals structural aspects of granule assembly in cells, and describes how the flow of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is severed under stress.</Abstract><MeSH>Active Transport, Cell Nucleus</MeSH><MeSH>Adenosine</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Nucleus</MeSH><MeSH>Cytoplasm</MeSH><MeSH>Cytoplasmic Granules</MeSH><MeSH>Cytoplasmic Structures</MeSH><MeSH>Exons</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Splicing</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Transport</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Long Noncoding</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>RNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Stress, Physiological</MeSH><MeSH>Tubercidin</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular compartment stress granules localize</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32503941"><Journal>Journal of cell science</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Proteomic analysis reveals the direct recruitment of intrinsically disordered regions to stress granules.</Title><Abstract>Stress granules (SGs) are stress-induced membraneless condensates that store non-translating mRNA and stalled translation initiation complexes.

Imatinib exhibited a therapeutic effect in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via selective inhibition tyrosine kinases. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects and more potency compared to imatinib. However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA is poorly understood. The present study investigated the treatment effect of dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice. We further demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis. The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS treated with dasatinib. Our findings suggest that dasatinib exhibited treatment effects on CIA mice and that FLS are an important target cell of dasatinib treatment in autoimmune arthritis.</Abstract><MeSH>Allergens</MeSH><MeSH>Arthritis</MeSH><MeSH>Autoimmune Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>B-Lymphocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Dasatinib</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunoglobulin E</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, IgE</MeSH><MeSH>T-Lymphocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>disease Dasatinib treat</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31416783"><Journal>Journal of cardiology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>The efficacy of tolvaptan in treating dasatinib-induced pleural effusions in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.</Title><Abstract>Cancer treatment has been developing significantly and cancer-related cardiovascular disease treatments such as various anticancer agents and molecular target drugs have been reported often in the era of oncocardiology. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy. Dasatinib is a novel tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved for CML with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the most common adverse effects of dasatinib are peripheral edema and pleural effusion, which sometimes impose the interruption or reduction of dosage of dasatinib treatment, accompanied by diuretic and steroid use. The goal of CML treatment is maintaining hematological control in the long term by controlling these side effects.

Although promising new therapies for this incurable disease are being tested in clinical trials, the therapeutic relevance of metabolic rewiring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify targetable metabolic differences in primary CLL lymphocytes by the use of Dasatinib. Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is being tested in clinical trials for several cancers including CLL. This drug has been shown to be beneficial to CML patients suffering from diabetes by reducing their glucose plasma levels. In keeping with this previous observation, we report that Dasatinib induced glucose use while reducing lactate production, suggesting that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases aerobic glycolysis and shifts glucose use in primary CLL lymphocytes. Our results suggest that primary CLL lymphocytes (independently of traditional prognostic factors) can be stratified in two subsets by their sensitivity to Dasatinib in vitro. Increased glucose use induced by Dasatinib or by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was not sufficient to sustain survival and ATP levels in CLL samples sensitive to Dasatinib. The two subsets of primary CLL lymphocytes are characterized as well by a differential dependency on mitochondrial respiration and the use of anabolic or catabolic processes to cope with induced metabolic/energetic stress. Differential metabolic reprogramming between subsets is supported by the contrasting effect on the survival of Dasatinib treated CLL lymphocytes with pharmacological inhibition of two master metabolic regulators (mTorc1 and AMPK) as well as induced autophagy. Alternative metabolic organization between subsets is further supported by the differential basal expression (freshly purified lymphocytes) of active AMPK, regulators of glucose metabolism and modulators of AKT signaling. The contrasting metabolic features revealed by our strategy could be used to metabolically target CLL lymphocyte subsets creating new therapeutic windows for this disease for mTORC1 or AMPK inhibitors. Indeed, we report that Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes was selectively cytotoxic to Dasatinib sensitive samples. Ultimately, we suggest that a similar strategy could be applied to other cancer types by using Dasatinib and/or relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors. </Abstract><MeSH>AMP-Activated Protein Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</MeSH><MeSH>Apoptosis</MeSH><MeSH>Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Coculture Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Glucose</MeSH><MeSH>Glucose Transporter Type 1</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Lactic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell</MeSH><MeSH>Lymphocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Oxidative Phosphorylation</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Cells, Cultured</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>disease Dasatinib treat</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31477798"><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Health-related quality of life of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with first-line dasatinib versus imatinib therapy.</Title><Abstract>There is paucity of evidence-based data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

We have investigated the genotoxic potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen causing devastating nosocomial infections in cystic fibrosis or immunocompromised patients. Our data revealed that infection of immune or epithelial cells by P. aeruginosa triggered DNA strand breaks and phosphorylation of histone H2AX (&#947;H2AX), a marker of DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, it induced formation of discrete nuclear repair foci similar to gamma-irradiation-induced foci, and containing &#947;H2AX and 53BP1, an adaptor protein mediating the DNA-damage response pathway. Gene deletion, mutagenesis, and complementation in P. aeruginosa identified ExoS bacterial toxin as the major factor involved in &#947;H2AX induction. Chemical inhibition of several kinases known to phosphorylate H2AX demonstrated that Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) was the principal kinase in P. aeruginosa-induced H2AX phosphorylation. Finally, infection led to ATM kinase activation by an auto-phosphorylation mechanism. Together, these data show for the first time that infection by P. aeruginosa activates the DNA double-strand break repair machinery of the host cells. This novel information sheds new light on the consequences of P. aeruginosa infection in mammalian cells. As pathogenic Escherichia coli or carcinogenic Helicobacter pylori can alter genome integrity through DNA double-strand breaks, leading to chromosomal instability and eventually cancer, our findings highlight possible new routes for further investigations of P. aeruginosa in cancer biology and they identify ATM as a potential target molecule for drug design. </Abstract><MeSH>ADP Ribose Transferases</MeSH><MeSH>Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Bacterial Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Bacterial Toxins</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomal Instability</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>HL-60 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Phosphorylation</MeSH><MeSH>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>g-H2AX marker double strand breaks</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31118484"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Staphylococcus aureus induces DNA damage in host cell.</Title><Abstract>Staphylococcus aureus causes serious medical problems in human and animals.

Basal ganglia possess high levels of adenosine A(2A) receptors, mainly on the external surfaces of neurons located at the indirect tracts between the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Experiments with animal models of Parkinson's disease indicate that adenosine A(2A) receptors are strongly involved in the regulation of the central nervous system. Co-localization of adenosine A(2A) and dopaminergic D2 receptors in striatum creates a milieu for antagonistic interaction between adenosine and dopamine. The experimental data prove that the best improvement of mobility in patients with Parkinson's disease could be achieved with simultaneous activation of dopaminergic D2 receptors and inhibition of adenosine A(2A) receptors. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, the use of selective antagonists of adenosine A(2A) receptors, such as istradefylline, led to the reversibility of movement dysfunction. These compounds might improve mobility during both monotherapy and co-administration with L-DOPA and dopamine receptor agonists. The use of adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists in combination therapy enables the reduction of the L-DOPA doses, as well as a reduction of side effects. In combination therapy, the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists might be used in both moderate and advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. The long-lasting administration of adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists does not decrease the patient response and does not cause side effects typical of L-DOPA therapy. It was demonstrated in various animal models that inhibition of adenosine A(2A) receptors not only decreases the movement disturbance, but also reveals a neuroprotective activity, which might impede or stop the progression of the disease. Recently, clinical trials were completed on the use of istradefylline (KW-6002), an inhibitor of adenosine A(2A) receptors, as an anti-Parkinson drug.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>antagonist istradefylline</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32059361"><Journal>International journal of molecular sciences</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>PDRN, a Bioactive Natural Compound, Ameliorates Imiquimod-Induced Psoriasis through NF-&#954;B Pathway Inhibition and Wnt/&#946;-Catenin Signaling Modulation.</Title><Abstract>Nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) plays a central role in psoriasis and canonical Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway blunts the immune-mediated inflammatory cascade in psoriasis.

In addition to modulating dopamine concentrations in the brain, there are D2-like dopamine receptor agonists that mimic the action of dopamine to compensate for the deficit in dopamine found in PD patients. Muscarinic antagonists' drugs are used rarely due to some side effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are among the first in line, and are considered popular drugs that reduce the metabolism of dopamine in PD patients.

The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta. Our results on four targets ranging in size from 15.5 to 27.3&#8201;kDa illustrate that the structures of proteins can be determined accurately and in an unsupervised manner in a matter of days.</Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Bacterial Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Conformation, beta-Strand</MeSH><MeSH>Thermoanaerobacter</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>4D-CHAINS algorithm</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31136183"><Journal>Journal of proteome research</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Incorporating Distance-Based Top-n-gram and Random Forest To Identify Electron Transport Proteins.</Title><Abstract>Cellular respiration provides direct energy substances for living organisms.

Indeed, an insufficient iodine intake may determine a thyroid dysfunction also with goiter, or it may be associated to clinical features such as stunted growth and mental retardation, referred as iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs). Iodine deficiency still remains an important public health problem in many countries, including Italy. The effective strategy for the prevention and control of IDDs is universal salt iodization, which was implemented in Italy in 2005 as a nationwide program adopted after the approval of an Italian law. Despite an improvement in the iodine intake, many regions in Italy are still characterized by mild iodine deficiency. In this review, we provide an overview of the historical evolution of the iodine status in the Calabria region, located in the South of Italy, during the past three decades. In particular, we have retraced an itinerary from the first epidemiological surveys at the end of the 1980s to the establishment of the Regional Observatory of Endemic Goiter and Iodine Prophylaxis, which represents an efficient model for the surveillance of IDDs and monitoring the efficacy of iodine prophylaxis.</Abstract><MeSH>Goiter, Endemic</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Iodine</MeSH><MeSH>Italy</MeSH><MeSH>Retrospective Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Sodium Chloride, Dietary</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>iodine prophylaxis</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30924199"><Journal>Clinical &amp; experimental optometry</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Ex vivo evaluation of the stability, safety and antibacterial efficacy of an extemporaneous povidone-iodine preparation for ophthalmic applications.</Title><Abstract>Povidone-iodine is used as a cost-effective broad-spectrum antiseptic in the prophylaxis and treatment of certain ocular infections.

The latter is a micronutrient essential for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones (TH). Iodine deficiency is responsible for a number of adverse effects on human health known as iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the most common of which worldwide are goiter and hypothyroidism. In order to reduce IDD, a national salt iodination program was started in Italy in 2005. In this article we reviewed the available data regarding iodine intake in the Lazio population before and after the introduction of the national salt iodination program, in order to evaluate its efficacy and the eventual problem(s) limiting its success. On the whole, the information acquired indicates that, following the introduction of the program, the dietary iodine intake in the Lazio population is improved. There is, however, still much work ahead to ameliorate the iodine prophylaxis in this region. In fact, although a generally adequate iodine intake in school-age children has been observed, there are still areas where a mild iodine insufficiency is present. Moreover, two independent epidemiological surveys on pregnant women evidenced a low urinary iodine concentration with respect to the reference range conceived by the World Health Organization. These findings demonstrate the need for greater attention to the iodine prophylaxis by health care providers (i.e., obstetricians, gynecologists, pediatricians, etc.), and the implementation of effective advertising campaigns aimed at increasing the knowledge and awareness of the favorable effects of iodine supplementation on population health.</Abstract><MeSH>Adolescent</MeSH><MeSH>Child</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Goiter</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Hypothyroidism</MeSH><MeSH>Iodine</MeSH><MeSH>Italy</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>National Health Programs</MeSH><MeSH>Nutritional Status</MeSH><MeSH>Pregnancy</MeSH><MeSH>Sodium Chloride, Dietary</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

There are two major types of gastric carcinoma: enteric type and diffuse type. Diffuse type gastric cancer is frequently associated with the mutations in E-cadherin coding gene CDH1. In cases of CDH1 mutations complete gastrectomy is indicated. CDH1 mutations are reflected with CDH1 protein loss by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between CDH1 mutations and other markers of tumour aggressiveness, such as tumour proliferation index and the presence of p53 mutations and Her2 amplification is not well studied. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse the correlation between CDH1 loss and the expression of Ki67 proliferation marker, mutant oncoprotein p53 and Her2. Standard immunohistochemistry was used to detect the following antigens: CDH1 (MCH-38, Invitrogen), Ki67 (EP5, Bio SB), p53 (DO-7, Leica) and Her2 (EP3, Bio SB). The study results showed that CDH1 mutations, reflected with CDH1 protein loss by immunohistochemistry are detected in 40% of diffuse gastric carcinomas, whilst it is not detected in enteric type gastric carcinomas. Diffuse gastric carcinomas with CDH1 mutations are characterised with more aggressive phenotype, particularly with the presence of higher Ki67 labelling index, p53 mutations and the presence of Her2 positivity. In cases of histological diagnosis of diffuse gastric carcinoma CDH1 testing is recommended.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The objective of our study was to investigate the impact of specific occupational conditions on chromosome aberration frequency and evaluate dosimeter-wearing compliance of industrial radiographers in Korea. We studied individual and occupational characteristics of 120 industrial radiographers working in South Korea and evaluated the frequency of dicentrics and translocations in chromosomes to estimate radiation exposure. The association between working conditions and chromosome aberration frequencies was assessed by Poisson regression analysis after adjusting for confounding factors. Legal personal dosimeter-wearing compliance among workers was investigated by correlation analysis between recorded dose and chromosome aberration frequency. Daily average number of radiographic films used in the last six months was associated with dicentrics frequency. Workers performing site radiography showed significantly higher translocation frequency than those working predominantly in shielded enclosures. The correlation between chromosome aberration frequency and recorded dose was higher in workers in the radiography occupation since 2012 (new workers) than other veteran workers. Our study found that site radiography could affect actual radiation exposure to workers.

We studied individual and occupational characteristics of 120 industrial radiographers working in South Korea and evaluated the frequency of dicentrics and translocations in chromosomes to estimate radiation exposure. The association between working conditions and chromosome aberration frequencies was assessed by Poisson regression analysis after adjusting for confounding factors. Legal personal dosimeter-wearing compliance among workers was investigated by correlation analysis between recorded dose and chromosome aberration frequency. Daily average number of radiographic films used in the last six months was associated with dicentrics frequency. Workers performing site radiography showed significantly higher translocation frequency than those working predominantly in shielded enclosures. The correlation between chromosome aberration frequency and recorded dose was higher in workers in the radiography occupation since 2012 (new workers) than other veteran workers. Our study found that site radiography could affect actual radiation exposure to workers. Controlling these working conditions and making an effort to improve personal dosimeter-wearing compliance among veteran workers as well as new workers may be necessary to reduce radiation exposure as much as possible in their workplace.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

In order to investigate the assembly of this complex, the ability of C9 molecules to bind to C5b-8 complexes was compared with the binding characteristics of C9 for C5b-8 complexes containing variable numbers of bound C9 molecules. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the C9 molecule for the C5b-8 site on a complement-sensitive strain of Escherichia coli was 1.2 (+/- 0.15) nM at 0 degree C. These conditions allow the binding of one C9 molecule per C5b-8 site. The C5b-8 site containing one C9 molecule bound a second C9 molecule at 0 degree C only after incubation at 37 degrees C. The binding of C9 to a C5b-8 site containing one C9 molecule was found to be 1.3 (+/- 0.2) nM. Therefore, the presence of a C9 molecule did not significantly alter the binding capacity of the C5b-8 site for additional C9 molecules. A similar result was obtained by using rabbit erythrocytes bearing either C5b-8 sites or C5b-8 sites containing one molecule of C9 per complex at 0 degree C. The similarity of binding characteristics for the first and second C9 molecules argues that the initial C9 molecule in the complex does not affect the binding of subsequent C9 molecules. This suggests that a unique C9 binding site that does not involve previously bound C9 molecules may exist on the forming membrane attack complex.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Complement C9</MeSH><MeSH>Complement Membrane Attack Complex</MeSH><MeSH>Complement System Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Erythrocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Escherichia coli</MeSH><MeSH>Hot Temperature</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Rabbits</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>molecule</QueryUsed><Result PMID="7966556"><Journal>Journal of virology</Journal><Year>1994</Year><Title>Incorporation of excess wild-type and mutant tRNA(3Lys) into human immunodeficiency virus type 1.</Title><Abstract>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles produced in COS-7 cells transfected with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA contain 8 molecules of tRNA(3Lys) per 2 molecules of genomic RNA and 12 molecules of tRNA1,2Lys per 2 molecules of genomic RNA. When COS-7 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing both HIV-1 proviral DNA and a human tRNA3Lys gene, there is a large increase in the amount of cytoplasmic tRNA3Lys per microgram of total cellular RNA, and the tRNA3Lys content in the virus increases from 8 to 17 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA. However, the total number of tRNALys molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA remains constant at 20; i.e., the viral tRNA1,2Lys content decreases from 12 to 3 molecules per 2 molecules of genomic RNA. All detectable tRNA3Lys is aminoacylated in the cytoplasm of infected cells and deacylated in the virus.

(1). For almost half a century, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has run a Monographs programme, which has been the premier global resource for the identification of agents that cause cancer (2). The Monographs apply rigorous procedures for the scientific review and evaluation of carcinogenic hazards by independent experts, free from conflict of interest. Since publishing Monograph conclusions on some pesticides (3), the IARC has been subject to intense efforts to undermine its evaluation and the whole organization. The conclusion in March 2015 that glyphosate is "probably carcinogenic to humans" in addition to being genotoxic and carcinogenic in animals led to unprecedented lobbying by the herbicide producer Monsanto, and resulted in high profile court cases in the USA (4). Monsanto's tactic has been to discredit the glyphosate evaluation, the scientists involved, the Monograph programme and the IARC in general (see the Monsanto papers, 5-7). This has manifested in an orchestrated exercise of damage-generation played out through a coordinated and repetitive misrepresentation of facts, planned already before the March 2015 meeting took place (5). The once-confidential Monsanto papers have exposed the "cozy connections" between the company leadership, some regulatory agencies, and the media to undermine and discredit the actions and evaluation report of the IARC. They have revealed company scientists casually discussing "ghost-writing" scientific papers and suppressing science that conflicts with corporate assertions of Roundup's safety. The Monsanto documents demonstrate the company's manipulation of science and regulators, which may have reflected on the conclusions around the safety of the herbicide (6-8). Evaluations of pesticides IARC has evaluated more than 60 of the 100s of active ingredients in pesticide formulations, less than 12 of which have been formally evaluated as either group 1 (human carcinogens) or 2A (probable human carcinogens) (2). Some of these, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloromethane (DDT) and lindane, have now been banned in most countries. The evaluation of pesticides typifies the problems associated with research and regulation of commonly used consumer and agricultural products. IARC's evaluation of "probably carcinogenic to humans" (group 2A) is the second strongest category of evidence in a four-tier scale. The industry reaction to the evaluation of glyphosate was not foreseen. The two other chemicals evaluated in the same meeting as probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A), diazinon and malathion, engendered no public debate. If a widely used herbicide turns out to be a putative cancer-causing chemical, the consequences for the producer can be potentially devastating. In May 2019, a court in California ordered Bayer AG to pay US$2 billion to a couple who claimed their cancers were caused by years of using Roundup. This was the third legal loss since August 2018 for Bayer AG, which has seen its market value plummet to $52 billion, cut nearly in half since it acquired Monsanto a year ago (9). More than 13 000 similar claims have been lodged (1). How is the herbicide used 'properly'? Ever since Monsanto introduced its line of Roundup weed-killers in 1974, the products have been touted as extremely safe. The company's statement that glyphosate is "safe and non-carcinogenic if used properly" is difficult to interpret in practice: even if you were dealing with a putative carcinogen, the cancer risk is not realized if you are not exposed to the agent, ie, the product is "safe if used properly". So what is the "proper use" of a herbicide? One would assume it is use that is according to instructions on the label and guidance given by the producer. But when spreading the weed killer, it may be difficult to avoid human exposure. The occupational exposure in agriculture is likely to carry the most significant risk, followed by environmental exposures and risks to the consumers. Occupational exposure of glyphosate may occur via inhalation, dermal contact, and/or ocular contact during manufacture, transport, use and disposal. The absorption through skin is a real possibility. The general population may be exposed to glyphosate through dermal contact with consumer products, crops, foliage, or soils containing residues of this chemical. As a result of the widespread usage, glyphosate is present at low levels in a wide range food items (10). The health risk is dependent on the level of exposure - it is the dose which makes the poison. The more intensively you are exposed, the longer the exposure period, and the higher the risk. The IARC evaluation does not take a position on the quantity or acceptability of the risk. This is not the task of the Agency but rather that of national decision-makers. The IARC evaluation constitutes a 'hazard evaluation' step in the risk assessment and management process - it is followed by an exposure analysis, quantitative risk assessment and risk-benefit analysis done in the policy-making process usually at the national regulatory level. What is evidence-informed policy-making? Simply put, evidence-informed policy is when decision-makers use the best available evidence to guide policy and regulations. Policy-makers in contemporary societies want to use evidence to make well-informed decisions, and scientists and scientific organizations are expected to provide the best evidence for their attention. A good supply of quality evidence and a healthy independent research community that is producing robust policy-relevant research is thus needed. A common issue is how to synthesize evidence that is more often than not sparse, full of gaps, and difficult to manage, to do it in a transparent fashion and to transfer the conclusions into reasonable policy decisions. Evidence-informed policy-making can be undermined by the manipulation or selective use of data, which is often driven by vested interests (11, 12). The point is well-taken in public health, with tobacco a prime example (13). Analysis of millions of internal tobacco industry documents has revealed the multiple strategies via which the tobacco industry has sought to, and often successfully, undermine public health policies (14). Tobacco is clearly an exceptional product; no other consumer product kills two in three users when used exactly as intended (15). But there is little to suggest that, as a corporate actor, "Big Tobacco" differs fundamentally from, eg., "Big Booze" or "Big Food" (16, 17). Disruptions of the scientific process and creation of doubt may lead to delays in translating evidence into policy, with the potential to cost lives (11). Consequently, scientists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, other health professionals, patients and populations have a collective responsibility not simply to be originators of scientific data but to be scrutinizers of their use, thereby protecting the interests of the many rather than the few. Some national regulatory bodies have asserted that glyphosate poses no public risk The regulatory European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have asserted that glyphosate poses no public risk. But the US Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry (ATSDR) has joined IARC in concluding that there is a potential cancer hazard with glyphosate and its formulations (3, 18). Several of the national health agencies in Europe, the USA, and elsewhere have sided with the interpretation of the producer - that the herbicide is safe when used properly. Campaigns against glyphosyte are the strongest in the European Union, where member nations in 2017 only narrowly reapproved a 5-year authorization of the compound. Why this discrepancy? As stated by Alfredo Morabia in a recent American Journal of Public Health editorial, "to defend what they perceive as in their best interests, some corporations not only pressure governmental agencies, they fight them." (19) In the same journal, Jonathan Samet (20) describes how Monsanto has moved extremely aggressively against the science, the unpaid expert volunteers, and institutions such as the IARC. The independent assessment of risk by "unpaid expert volunteers cannot be replaced by reviews from scientists paid by the industry." (20) The risk management may go beyond scientific evidence and imply the contribution of social values and social theory, in contrast to independent risk assessment (21). Through the Monsanto papers, it has become clear that while the company was not willing to conduct the proposed long-term product safety studies (eg, a long-term carcinogenicity bioassay on the formulated product), the company spent millions of dollars on secretive PR campaigns - including $17 million in one year after the IARC evaluation had been published - to finance "ghost-written" studies and editorials aimed at discrediting independent scientists whose work had found dangers with Monsanto's pesticides. These controversial "ghost-written" papers have been available as evidence for non-carcinogenicity in the regulatory processes. The EFSA has had apparent links with the pesticides industry, eg, through organizations such as International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). A recent analysis of ILSI's activities concluded that the organisation "should be regarded as an industry group - a private body - and regulated as such, not as a body acting for the greater good" (22). While ILSI purports to be working for health and wellbeing of populations internationally, the authors of the analysis "identified overt attempts by ILSI to influence individuals, positions, and policy, both at national and international levels, alongside clear statements that ILSI's corporate members deploy it as a tool to thwart policies or leaders who are hostile to their interests." (22) It is noteworthy that the chair of ILSI's Board of Trustees chaired the UN's joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) meeting on glyphosate that found the herbicide to be "probably not carcinogenic to humans" (23). This was of great interest to ILSI major donors Monsanto and its industry representative CropLife International. The final meeting report included no conflict of interest statement, even though ILSI Europe had received donations worth more than US$1 million (from Monsanto and Croplife International) (23). The EU hazard-based approach Individuals connected to ILSI continue to play a role in the EU's advisory mechanisms. These activities have contributed to recommendations such as a slew of industry positions on pesticides (23). Their report recommended inter alia that the EU's precautionary hazard -based approach should be re-examined to determine whether it is delivering the intended levels of protection. The report recommended replacing current rules that outlaw any product that could harm with a US-style concept of "acceptable risk" (24). Unique to Europe, "the hazards approach" means that any pesticide found to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic, persistent or bioaccumulative, occurring even at low levels, can be regulated or even banned. Monsanto has been careful to ensure that the US EPA is on board (25). Ominously, EPA staff has been accused of collusion with Monsanto to downgrade the health hazards of glyphosate (26). Jess Rowland, formerly a manager in the EPA's pesticide division, is said to have boasted in an April 2015 conversation with a Monsanto regulatory affairs manager that "If I can kill this, I should get a medal" (27). In October 2015, the EPA's Cancer Assessment Review Committee (CARC), chaired by Rowland, produced an internal report claiming that glyphosate, contrary to the IARC findings, was "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" (28). The US EPA has recently reconfirmed its position of "no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with the its current label" and "glyphosate is not a carcinogen" (29). Health risks are not the only concern with glyphosate. The vast increase in its use has also caused a substantial increase in glyphosate-tolerant weeds, dubbed "superweeds" by some (30). Conflict of interests As the proverb states: "Who pays the piper, calls the tune", most of us understand what is meant by "conflict of interest". The professional ethics codes have paid attention to conflicts of interest since 1970s, with better or worse consequences. Connected with conflict of interest, "duty of loyalty" is a term used in corporate law to describe a fiduciary's "conflict of interest". Accordingly, fiduciaries must put the corporation's interests ahead of their own (31). Indeed, the fiduciary responsibilities of all corporations require them to maximize their profits regardless of consequences to health, society, or the environment and thus to oppose policies that could reduce their profits (32). This obviously causes problems in evaluating evidence if the topic of evaluation - such as a particular pesticide - falls under the interest of the corporation. Corporations defend their rights and their primary interests, which most often are financial ones. In the case of public health, the health of the population is the primary interest. In some situations, corporations have meddled in public policy-making on chemicals and topics where they have vested interests in terms of financial profits, trade and market shares. This all means a strong conflict of interest situation: the primary interests in public health are displaced by the interests of the corporations (21). Corporations cannot be expected to assess impartially the potential toxicity of their own products. The independent creation of evidence requires specific procedures and skills necessary to draw conclusions based on the review and summary of a large body of evidence in order for it to be transparent and useful for policy decisions. As Morabia puts it: "IARC Monographs are an ingenious way to do exactly that" (19). Discussion Drawing conclusions on the causation of adverse health effects by environmental chemicals can have important societal consequences, leading to policy-making which can control, limit or even prevent the exposure to the pollutant through regulation and litigation. There are critical lessons to be learned from the Monsanto saga. The whole process of evidence-informed policy-making is under threat. The case of glyphosate is by no means over; further research is needed to cover the knowledge gaps, but this should be done independently and with full transparency. The IARC Monographs provide the scientific evaluation of the evidence based on comprehensive review of the scientific literature, but it remains the responsibility of individual governments and other international organizations to recommend, if any, regulations, legislation and other public health interventions. The IARC Monographs evaluate the hazard, but the societal decisions take also other factors into account while making the risk management decisions. The risk management philosophies for pesticides in various countries are different - in the EU, for example, the hazards (inherent properties) are emphasized while, in the US, the utilitarian acceptable risk approach prevails. The active ingredients for pesticide formulations are under constant development. Sometimes the dominant role of one ingredient may have a damping effect in the innovation paths. This seems to have been the case with the weed-killing chemical glyphosate. The company which produces glyphosate has a central role in the weed-killer and the associated genetically modified tolerant crops market. Glyphosate dominates the field of weed killers worldwide: no compound with a new way of attacking weeds, or mode of action, has been commercialized for more than 30 years (9). Glyphosate is at the center of a public herbicide debate. Cropping systems are currently very reliant on herbicides. If glyphosate is pulled out of the market, what are the alternatives? It is clear that companies need to ramp up their R&amp;D efforts to develop new candidate chemicals - or nonchemical alternatives - and new technologies for sustainable weed control, such as targeted spraying of herbicides directly into weeds, use of lasers, blades or electricity to kill weeds, are needed. Evidence based on independent research provides the best tools to protect humans from harmful products, behaviors, and policies. Many responsible companies that market products that may have wide-spread exposure (such as pesticides) or potentially pose a risk to humans are collaborating internationally to gather the evidence. Instead of attacking the science, scientists, and science organizations and manipulating the media, such companies are working with the science community to secure human health and protect the environment. Disclosure statement In my past career, I served on the IARC Monographs program as a staff member from 1983 to the early 1990s. I have not been involved in the evaluation of glyphosate at any level. I currently have no employment links to the IARC or any financial interests in writing this commentary. While my spouse serves currently as the Director of IARC, she is in no way responsible for any part of the text. All the responsibility lies with me and me only. References 1. Braceras JC.

This study was designed to delineate the contribution of CD4(+) T cells in the pathogenesis of SLE disease. Forty-four patients (3 male: 41 female) and 20 healthy volunteers (4 male: 16 female) were included in the study. CD4(+) lymphocytes analysis was done using three-color flow cytometry with antibodies against human-CD95, a prototype cell death receptor, and the chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7) after gating for lymphocytes based on the forward and side scatter. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-&#945; and IL-10 cytokines were assayed using ELISA. Disease activity was assessed using the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). Based on the expression of CCR7 and CD95, CD4(+) lymphocytes were subdivided into three particular subsets; CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(+) cells, CD4(+)CD95(-)CCR7(+) cells and CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(-) cells. Percentage of CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(+) cell subset was significantly higher in patients with SLE with active disease (SLEDAI&#160;&gt;&#160;6) and inactive (SLEDAI&#160;&lt;&#160;6) as compared with controls (P&#160;=&#160;0.005), and it showed a significant positive correlation with ANA titer (P&#160;=&#160;0.01), and a negative correlation with WBCs count (P&#160;=&#160;0.001). CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(-) cell subset was significantly higher in active SLE patients in comparison to patients with inactive disease and controls (P&#160;=&#160;0.05, P&#160;=&#160;0.005 respectively), and it correlates positively with SLEDAI, IL-6 and IL-17 levels (P&#160;=&#160;0.001, 0.05, 0.01 respectively), and negatively with blood WBCs counts (P&#160;=&#160;0.001). The third CD4(+)CD95(-)CCR7(+)cell subset was found significantly lower in SLE patients compared with controls, and it was found negatively correlated with IL-10, IL-6, and IL-17. The results show that CD4(+)CD95(+)subset lacking expression of CCR7 is associated with cell mediated inflammatory response as manifested by its correlation with signs of inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and disease activity index. Whereas, CD4(+)CD95(+)CCR7(+) correlate more with antibody immune responses as manifested by association with serum ANA. These data suggest disparate roles of these cell subsets in the pathophysiology of SLE. A better understanding of the characteristics of CD4 cell subsets may shed light on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE. </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>characteristics SLEDAI index SLE patients</QueryUsed><Result PMID="29305669"><Journal>Clinical rheumatology</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>Metabolic syndrome in Iranian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and its determinants.</Title><Abstract>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Iranian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its determinants. In a cross-sectional study, 98 patients with SLE and 95 controls were enrolled. Prevalence of MetS was determined based on American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) and 2009 harmonizing criteria. In addition, demographic features and lupus characteristics such as disease duration, pharmacological treatment, laboratory data, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage index (SDI) were recorded. The predictors of MetS were obtained by backward stepwise regression analysis. Using AHA/NHLBI, MetS was observed in 35 (35.7%) patients and 28 (29.8%) controls (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.4). Using harmonizing criteria, MetS was observed in 37 (37.7%) patients and 33 (35.1%) controls (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.7). There was no difference in frequency distribution of MetS components between the patients and the controls. In multivariate regression analysis, low C3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and body mass index were independent determinants of MetS in lupus patients.

One hundred and two patients with SLE were enrolled and followed up for 2 to 8&#160;months and visited at least 3 times. Physician Global Assessment, BILAG-2004, SLEDAI-2K, SLAM-R, and ECLAM, were calculated in every visit. Treatment change, dependent variable, was categorized as decrease/no change vs. increase. The aforementioned indices, independent variables, were compared to learn their ability in predicting the treatment change. The probability of treatment change was measured by generalized linear-mixed effect model (GLMM) and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Adjusted odds ratios were calculated. Predictive power of indices was compared by area under the curve (AUC) in plots of sensitivity vs. 1-specificity and application of receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). BILAG-2004 and SLEDAI-2K had substantial correlation with treatment change. Among different GLMM models, BILAG-2004 followed by SLEDAI-2K showed the highest associations with treatment change.

We earlier used luspatercept and RAP-536 protein traps for certain Smad2/3-pathway ligands to implicate Smad2/3-pathway overactivation in dysregulated erythroid differentiation associated with murine &#946;-thalassaemia and myelodysplasia. Importantly, luspatercept alleviates anaemia and has been shown to reduce transfusion burden in patients with &#946;-thalassaemia or myelodysplasia. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying luspatercept action and pSmad2/3-mediated inhibition of erythroid differentiation. In murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells in vitro, ligand-mediated overactivation of the Smad2/3 pathway reduced nuclear levels of GATA-1 (GATA-binding factor-1) and its transcriptional activator TIF1&#947; (transcription intermediary factor 1&#947;), increased levels of reactive oxygen species, reduced cell viability and haemoglobin levels, and inhibited erythroid differentiation. Co-treatment with luspatercept in MEL cells partially or completely restored each of these.

Here, we analyze the role of the Drosophila G3BP Rasputin (RIN) in unstressed cells, where RIN is not SG associated. Immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis identifies over 550 mRNAs that copurify with RIN. The mRNAs found in SGs are long and translationally silent. In contrast, we find that RIN-bound mRNAs, which encode core components of the transcription, splicing, and translation machinery, are short, stable, and highly translated. We show that RIN is associated with polysomes and provide evidence for a direct role for RIN and its human homologs in stabilizing and upregulating the translation of their target mRNAs. We propose that when cells are stressed, the resulting incorporation of RIN/G3BPs into SGs sequesters them away from their short target mRNAs. This would downregulate the expression of these transcripts, even though they are not incorporated into stress granules.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>mRNAs sequestered stress granules</QueryUsed><Result PMID="24323415"><Journal>Translational stroke research</Journal><Year>2013</Year><Title>mRNA redistribution during permanent focal cerebral ischemia.</Title><Abstract>Translation arrest occurs in neurons following focal cerebral ischemia and is irreversible in penumbral neurons destined to die. Following global cerebral ischemia, mRNA is sequestered away from 40S ribosomal subunits as mRNA granules, precluding translation. Here, we investigated mRNA granule formation using fluorescence in situ histochemistry out to 8 h permanent focal cerebral ischemia using middle cerebral artery occlusion in Long Evans rats with and without diabetes. Neuronal mRNA granules colocalized with PABP, HuR, and NeuN, but not 40S or 60S ribosomal subunits, or organelle markers. The volume of brain with mRNA granule-containing neurons decreased exponentially with ischemia duration, and was zero after 8 h permanent focal cerebral ischemia or any duration of ischemia in diabetic rats. These results show that neuronal mRNA granule response has a limited range of insult intensity over which it is expressed. Identifying the limits of effective neuronal stress response to ischemia will be important for developing effective stroke therapies.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antigens, Nuclear</MeSH><MeSH>Brain Ischemia</MeSH><MeSH>Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental</MeSH><MeSH>ELAV Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence</MeSH><MeSH>Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Nerve Tissue Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Neurons</MeSH><MeSH>Poly(A)-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH><MeSH>Rats, Long-Evans</MeSH><MeSH>Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic</MeSH><MeSH>Ribosome Subunits, Small, Eukaryotic</MeSH><MeSH>Time Factors</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>mRNAs sequestered stress granules</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31628867"><Journal>The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Phosphorylation-dependent control of an RNA granule-localized protein that fine-tunes defence gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.</Title><Abstract>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key signalling modules of plant defence responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns [PAMPs; e.g. the bacterial peptide flagellin (flg22)].

Systemic therapies such as chemotherapy and more recently target therapies as well as immunotherapy have improved the prognosis of this large group of complex malignant diseases. However, the frequent emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms is one of the major impediments towards curative treatment of cancer. While several mechanisms of drug chemoresistance are well defined, resistance to immunotherapy is still insufficiently unclear due to the complexity of the immune response and its dependence on the host. Expression and regulation of immune checkpoint molecules (such as PD-1, CD279; PD-L1, CD274; and CTLA-4, CD152) play a key role in the response to immunotherapy. In this regard, immunotherapy based on immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) is a common clinical approach for treatment of patients with poor prognosis when other first-line therapies have failed. Unfortunately, about 70 % of patients are classified as non-responders, or they progress after initial response to these ICIs. Multiple factors can be related to immunotherapy resistance: characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME); presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), such as CD8 + T cells associated with treatment-response; presence of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs); activation of certain regulators (like PIK3&#947; or PAX4) found present in non-responders; a low percentage of PD-L1 expressing cells; tumor mutational burden (TMB); gain or loss of antigen-presenting molecules; genetic and epigenetic alterations correlated with resistance. This review provides an update on the current state of immunotherapy resistance presenting targets, biomarkers and remedies to overcome such resistance.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>problems associated with PD-L1 immunotherapy biomarker</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31407494"><Journal>Cancer medicine</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Risk stratification for lung adenocarcinoma on EGFR and TP53 mutation status, chemotherapy, and PD-L1 immunotherapy.</Title><Abstract>The overall survival rates for lung cancer remain unsatisfactorily low, even for patients with biomarkers for which target therapies or immunotherapies are recommended. Better identification of at-risk patients is needed to achieve more effective personalized treatment. Here, we derived a risk-stratifying gene signature consisting of five genes that had the greatest differential expression by stage from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptomes. The new gene signature enabled survival prognosis for multiple LUAD datasets from different platforms of transcriptomics and risk stratification for patients with and without a mutation in TP53 or EGFR, with high and low levels of PD-L1, and with and without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Using these evaluations, it was also shown to be more robust compared to several other gene signatures. Functional analysis of the five genes and their protein-protein interaction partners indicated that they are functionally enriched in cell cycle, endocytosis, and EGFR regulation, which are biological processes associated with lung cancer and drug resistance. Extensive discussions on related experimental studies suggest that the five genes are novel and sensible targets for developing new drugs and/or tackling drug resistance problems for LUAD.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Clinical and preclinical studies have suggested strategies to prevent the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in people at risk, but the outcomes of previous clinical trials have not met their primary endpoints of disease prevention or delay. The results from the TN-10 teplizumab prevention trial show that the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can be delayed by treatment with a FcR non-binding monoclonal antibody to CD3 in people at high risk for disease.

Though heterozygous mutations in MITF are a major cause for Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2), homozygous mutations in this gene and the associated phenotype have been rarely characterized. In this study, we identified a novel p.R223H mutation in MITF in a Chinese Han family with variable WS features. Both parents carried a heterozygous p.R223H mutation. They had normal hearing, and premature greying of the hair is their only pigmentary abnormality. In contrast, their two children both carried a homozygous p.R223H mutation and had classic WS features including profound hearing loss, heterochromia irides and marked pigmentary abnormalities in hair and skin. Interestingly, the two affected children also have persistent chronic constipation since the neonatal period, symptoms suggestive of Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4). Our study revealed a likely association between homozygous mutations in MITF and WS4, which implies a dosage effect for the underlying pathogenesis mechanism.</Abstract><MeSH>Asian Continental Ancestry Group</MeSH><MeSH>Child</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Heterozygote</MeSH><MeSH>Hirschsprung Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Homozygote</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>PAX3 Transcription Factor</MeSH><MeSH>Pedigree</MeSH><MeSH>Phenotype</MeSH><MeSH>SOXE Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Waardenburg Syndrome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>symptoms Waardenburg Syndrome</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32086958"><Journal>Clinical and experimental dermatology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Lentiginosis and cafe-au-lait macules as part of the phenotypic spectrum of PAX3-related disorders.</Title><Abstract>Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is characterised by hypopigmentation of the hair and skin, congenital sensorineural hearing and various defects of neural crest derived tissues.

When it is accompanied by psychosis, symptom management is especially challenging. Although no drug has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psychosis in patients with dementia, atypical antipsychotics are used off-label in severe cases in patients who do not respond to non-pharmacological interventions. However, antipsychotic use in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (DRP) is associated with adverse reactions including motor function disorders, cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular events, and increased risk of death. In 2017, the US FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to the new antipsychotic pimavanserin for the treatment of DRP. Topline result of the pivotal phase III HARMONY (NCT03325556) trial suggests that pimavanserin reduces the relapse of psychosis by 2.8-folds compared to placebo. This favorable result may open path for the potential approval of pimavanserin in DRP. In this review, we discuss the pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as a novel atypical antipsychotic with potentials to address the unmet needs of older adults with DRP.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is also used in AD diagnosis by visualizing amyloid deposition in the brain. These methods are invasive or expensive; therefore, less invasive and easily detectable blood biomarkers are required. Because our previous study showed that flotillin release, a marker of exosomes, was attenuated by A&#946;, we designed the present study to determine whether flotillin level could be reduced in CSF and/or serum of patients with AD. In this study, we analyzed flotillin levels in CSF and serum of non-AD controls, patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by western blotting. Flotillin levels in cerebroventricular fluid (CVF) and serum of AD, vascular dementia (VaD), and non-AD autopsy cases were also analyzed. Flotillin levels significantly decreased in the CSF and serum of AD patients compared with those of non-AD controls, respectively. Moreover, in patients with MCI due to AD determined by PiB-PET, CSF and serum flotillin levels significantly decreased compared with those of patients with MCI due to non-AD. Flotillin levels remained unchanged in CVF and serum of autopsy cases diagnosed as VaD. Serum flotillin level is negatively associated with brain amyloid deposition indicated as PiB uptake. These results demonstrate that serum flotillin level can serve as one of the blood markers for estimation of brain amyloid deposition and early diagnosis of AD.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>Flotillin exosomal marker</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31683489"><Journal>Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Flotillin is a Novel Diagnostic Blood Marker of Alzheimer's Disease.</Title><Abstract>Currently, best-characterized indicators for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis are the decreased levels of amyloid-&#946; protein 42 and increased levels of phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is also used in AD diagnosis by visualizing amyloid deposition in the brain. These methods are invasive or expensive; therefore, less invasive and easily detectable blood biomarkers are required. Because our previous study showed that flotillin release, a marker of exosomes, was attenuated by A&#946;, we designed the present study to determine whether flotillin level could be reduced in CSF and/or serum of patients with AD. In this study, we analyzed flotillin levels in CSF and serum of non-AD controls, patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by western blotting.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function and RNA binding protein (RBP) homeostasis regulate autophagy. We observed that the ER chaperones GRP78/BiP, Sigma receptor 1 (SigR1), and VAPB were elevated in many AD patients' subicular neurons. However, those neurons which were affected by GVD showed lower chaperone levels, and there was only minor co-localization of chaperones with GVD bodies (GVBs), suggesting that neurons lacking sufficient chaperone-mediated proteostasis enter the GVD pathway. Consistent with this notion, granular, incipient pTau aggregates in human AD and pR5 tau transgenic mouse neurons were regularly co-localized with increased chaperone immunoreactivity, whereas neurons with mature neurofibrillary tangles lacked both the chaperone buildup and significant GVD. On the other hand, APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) transgenic mouse hippocampal neurons that are devoid of pTau accumulation displayed only few GVBs-like vesicles, which were still accompanied by prominent chaperone buildup. Identifying a potential trigger for GVD, we found cytoplasmic accumulations of RBPs including Matrin 3 and FUS as well as stress granules in GVBs of AD patient and pR5 mouse neurons. Interestingly, we observed that GVBs containing aggregated pTau and pTDP-43 were consistently co-localized with the exosomal marker Flotillin 1 in both AD and pR5 mice. In contrast, intraneuronal 82E1-immunoreactive amyloid-&#946; in human AD and APP/PS1 mice only rarely co-localized with Flotillin 1-positive exosomal vesicles. We conclude that altered chaperone-mediated ER protein homeostasis and impaired autophagy manifesting in GVD are linked to both pTau and RBP accumulation and that some GVBs might be targeted to exocytosis.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Endemic to Africa, outbreaks have been recorded in six African countries since its detection in 1976. Fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola viruses (EBoV), with humans and other mammals serving as accidental hosts. Transmission of EBoV has been reported in various ways, including human to human transmission through close contact with blood and bodily fluids. The virus has an incubation period ranging from two to twenty-one days, followed by a multitude of clinical manifestations such as the sudden onset of high fever, chills and myalgia depicting a flu-like syndrome. It is usually diagnosed based on several clinical symptoms such as the sudden onset of illness, high fevers for less than three weeks, and at least two hemorrhagic symptoms despite no predisposing factors. This generally provides enough evidence for clinicians to consider EHF and begin supportive treatment until the virus is confirmed through laboratory findings. Management of patients involves supportive care such as maintaining fluid along with electrolyte balance, blood pressure and oxygen saturation. This also includes treating complications arising from secondary infections. The main options include: prophylactic strategies, anti-viral therapy for EVD, immunotherapies, vaccines, and ZMapp. Finally, the key to managing EBoV epidemics is to stop the transmission of disease in the most severely affected population, as prevention has become of utmost importance to alleviate the significant physical and economic burden.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

In this article, we will review the progress of structural proteomics initiatives targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent of the 2003 worldwide epidemic that culminated in approximately 8,000 cases and 800 deaths. The SARS-CoV genome encodes 28 proteins in three distinct classes, many of them with unknown function and sharing low similarity to other proteins. The structures of 16 SARS-CoV proteins or functional domains have been determined to date. Remarkably, eight of these 16 proteins or functional domains have novel folds, indicating the uniqueness of the coronavirus proteins. The results of SARS-CoV structural proteomics initiatives will have several profound biological impacts, including elucidation of the structure-function relationships of coronavirus proteins; identification of targets for the design of anti-viral compounds against SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses; and addition of new protein folds to the fold space, with further understanding of the structure-function relationships for several new protein families.

More than 1.21 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 67,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted COVID-19 as a pandemic now. Multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 evolution indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins contains molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications in understanding the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>SARS-CoV proteome</QueryUsed><Result PMID="18054092"><Journal>Antiviral research</Journal><Year>2008</Year><Title>International research networks in viral structural proteomics: again, lessons from SARS.</Title><Abstract>Emerging and re-emerging pathogens and bioterror threats require an organized and coherent response from the worldwide research community to maximize available resources and competencies with the primary goals to understand the pathogen and enable intervention. In 2001, the Structural Proteomics In Europe (SPINE) project prototyped the pan-viral structural genomic approach, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 accelerated the concept of structural characterization of all proteins from a viral proteome and the interaction with their host partners. Following that approach, in 2004 the center for Functional and Structural Proteomics for SARS-CoV related proteins was initiated as part of the US NIH NIAID proteomics resource centers. Across worldwide efforts in Asia, Europe and America, the international research teams working on SARS-CoV have now determined experimental structural information for 45% of the SARS-CoV proteins and 53% of all its soluble proteins. This data is fully available to the scientific community and is providing an unprecedented level of insight to this class of RNA viruses. The efforts and results by the international scientific community to the SARS outbreak are serving as an example and roadmap of a rapid response using modern research methods.</Abstract><MeSH>Communicable Diseases, Emerging</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>International Cooperation</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Proteomics</MeSH><MeSH>Research</MeSH><MeSH>SARS Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</MeSH><MeSH>Viral Proteins</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising anti-cancer method involving the use of light-activated photosensitisers to precisely induce oxidative stress and cell death in cancers. ABCG2 can efflux photosensitisers from out of cells, reducing the capacity of PDT and limiting the efficacy of treatment. Many studies have attempted to elucidate the relationship between the expression of ABCG2 in cancers, its effect on the cellular retention of photosensitisers and its impact on PDT. This review looks at the studies which investigate the effect of ABCG2 on a range of different photosensitisers in different pre-clinical models of cancer. This work also evaluates the approaches that are being investigated to address the role of ABCG2 in PDT with an outlook on potential clinical validation.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>protein ABCG2 transmembrane</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31780416"><Journal>Comptes rendus biologies</Journal><Year/><Title>Expression and regulation of ABCG2/BCRP1 by sex steroids in the Harderian gland of the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).</Title><Abstract>The ATP-Binding Cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) transporter is associated with the regulation of protoporphyrin IX transport and of other intermediates in heme biosynthesis. Because the hamster Harderian gland (HG) exhibits high concentrations of porphyrins and sexual dimorphism, we analyzed the hamster ABCG2. Cloned cDNA [2098-base pairs (bp)] contains an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1971-bp that encodes a 656 amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 72844.56Da. The hamster ABCG2 sequence is conserved phylogenetically and shares a high percentage of identity with mouse (89%), rat (88%), and human (84%) transporters. Within its structure, a Walker A (G-X-X-G-X-G-K-S), a C signature motif characteristic of ABC transporters, and six putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) were identified. ABCG2 mRNA was detected in all hamster tissues, with higher amounts found in HG, brain, cerebellum, kidney, gut, ovary, and testis. Harderian ABCG2 expression exhibits a sexually dimorphic pattern where females display higher mRNA levels than males. Different patterns of transcriptional profiles of ABCG2 during the estrous cycle and after gonadectomy in both sexes were also observed. The differential expression between male and female HGs suggests that ABCG2 is under the regulation of gonadal steroids. The ABCG2 transporter is likely involved in the endogenous regulation of porphyrins in hamster HGs.</Abstract><MeSH>ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cricetinae</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Complementary</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gonadal Steroid Hormones</MeSH><MeSH>Harderian Gland</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mesocricetus</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Porphyrins</MeSH><MeSH>Protoporphyrins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Rats</MeSH><MeSH>Sex Characteristics</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>protein ABCG2 transmembrane</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31664714"><Journal>Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Protein Expression and Functional Relevance of Efflux and Uptake Drug Transporters at the Blood-Brain Barrier of Human Brain and Glioblastoma.</Title><Abstract>The knowledge of transporter protein expression and function at the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical to prediction of drug BBB penetration and design of strategies for improving drug&#160;delivery to the brain or&#160;brain tumor.

Radiation-induced osteosarcoma is one of the rare types of radiation-induced sarcomas, with the risk of radiation-induced osteosarcomas being only 0.01%-0.03% among all patients treated with radiotherapy. There have been only four reported cases of radiation-induced osteosarcomas after radiotherapy for gliomas.

Our aim was to provide robust and comparable estimates of anal cancer burden across these groups.

Fatigue is not widely understood and is often underrepresented in treatment regimes. Fatigue is the least successfully managed symptom of these conditions; however, it can often be the one of the greatest impairments.Augmented reality (AR) enhances a person's reality showing a hybrid environment where real and virtual objects coexist. Currently educational AR applications are saturating the application market, as they have shown great potential for increasing comprehension and understanding of complex concepts. AR expands user engagement by enhancing the learner's enjoyment and enriching their learning environment.This research explores the development and subsequent effect of an AR application on education around fatigue and basic neuroanatomy within the general population. The application was created using medical scan dataset, a variety of 3D modelling software and a game engine to create a functional and interactive augmented application. The application explores the effects of fatigue on a person's daily life while also laying a foundation of basic neuroanatomy. A pilot test conducted on 14 participants (8 males, 5 females and 1 other), with ages ranged 16-64 (4 form range 16 to 24, 5 from range 25 to 34, 1 from range 35 to 44, 3 from range 45 to 54, 1 from 55 to 64), shows the application is highly usable, increases understanding of basic neuroanatomical concepts and has the potential to improve understanding of fatigue. Nonetheless, further development and testing of the application are imperative so that we can gain a better understanding of the usability of the application with wider audiences. Future developments will aim to further aid knowledge acquisition and enhance understanding of fatigue, a complex and widely misunderstood concept.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Here, we used DamID to profile Tcrb locus interactions with the nuclear lamina at high resolution. We identified a lamina-associated domain (LAD) border composed of several CTCF-binding elements that segregates active non-LAD from inactive LAD regions of the locus. Deletion of the LAD border causes an enhancer-dependent spread of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation from the active recombination center into recombination center-proximal LAD chromatin. This is associated with a disruption to nuclear lamina association, increased chromatin looping to the recombination center, and increased transcription and recombination of recombination center-proximal gene segments. Our results show that a LAD and LAD border are critical components of Tcrb locus gene regulation and suggest that LAD borders may generally function to constrain the activity of nearby enhancers.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Loci</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Lysine</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Inbred C57BL</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Lamina</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta</MeSH><MeSH>Recombination, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptional Activation</MeSH><MeSH>V(D)J Recombination</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>lamina-associated domains LADs associated with transcriptional activation</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30982597"><Journal>Cell</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Promoter-Intrinsic and Local Chromatin Features Determine Gene Repression in LADs.</Title><Abstract>It is largely unclear whether genes that are naturally embedded in lamina-associated domains (LADs) are inactive due to their chromatin environment or whether LADs are merely secondary to the lack of transcription.

Activation of such genes is often accompanied by repositioning toward the nuclear interior. How this process works and how it impacts flanking chromosomal regions are poorly understood. We addressed these questions by systematic activation or inactivation of individual genes, followed by detailed genome-wide analysis of NL interactions, replication timing, and transcription patterns. Gene activation inside LADs typically causes NL detachment of the entire transcription unit, but rarely more than 50-100&#160;kb of flanking DNA, even when multiple neighboring genes are activated. The degree of detachment depends on the expression level and the length of the activated gene. Loss of NL interactions coincides with a switch from late to early replication timing, but the latter can involve longer stretches of DNA. Inactivation of active genes can lead to increased NL contacts. These extensive datasets are a resource for the analysis of LAD rewiring by transcription and reveal a remarkable flexibility of interphase chromosomes.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The disease onset usually occurs before the third decade of life and causes severe dysfunction in various organs. The most classical clinical findings are hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, cardiomyopathy, liver fibrosis, glycemic changes, arthropathy and skin pigmentation. However, secondary hypothyroidism is not reported in these patients. Juvenile hemochromatosis has an autosomal recessive inheritance and might be type 2A or type 2B, due to mutation in either the hemojuvelin gene (HJV) or hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP) gene. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old female patient was admitted with a recent history of diabetic ketoacidosis. Three months after that admission, she presented with arthralgia, diffuse abdominal pain, adynamia, hair loss, darkening of the skin and amenorrhea. Severe iron overload was found and findings in the hepatic biopsy were compatible with hemochromatosis. An upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed iron deposition in the liver and pancreas and pituitary MRI exhibited accumulation on the anterior pituitary. After 16 months the patient presented with dyspnea and lower limb edema, and cardiac MRI indicated iron deposition in the myocardium. The patient was diagnosed with juvenile hemochromatosis presenting with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, cardiomyopathy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and secondary hypothyroidism. A novel homozygous mutation, c.697delC, in the HJV gene was detected.

Here, we report the first major update of LDP (http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/signatures) with substantial changes in the data architecture and APIs, a completely redesigned user interface, and enhanced curated metadata annotations to support more advanced, intuitive and deeper querying, exploration and analysis capabilities. The cornerstone of this update has been the decision to reprocess all high-level LINCS datasets and make them accessible at the data point level enabling users to directly access and download any subset of signatures across the entire library independent from the originating source, project or assay.

The proteins encoded by these genes, whose expression is often tissue-specific, act as epigenetic suppressors contributing to the addition of repressive chromatin marks and DNA methylation. Due to its high complexity, the KRAB-ZNF family has not been studied in sufficient detail, and the involvement of its members in carcinogenesis remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs using publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer datasets. We analyzed 6727 tumor and normal tissue samples from 16 cancer types. Here, we showed that a small but distinctive cluster of 16 KRAB-ZNFs is commonly upregulated across multiple cancer cohorts in comparison to normal samples. We confirmed these observations in the independent panels of lung and breast cancer cell lines and tissues. This upregulation was also observed for most of the KRAB-ZNF splicing variants, whose expression is simultaneously upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, by analyzing the clinicopathological data for breast and lung cancers, we demonstrated that the expression of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs correlates with patient survival, tumor histology, and molecular subtyping. Altogether, our study allowed the identification and characterization of KRAB-ZNF factors that may have an essential function in cancer biology and thus potential to become novel oncologic biomarkers and treatment targets.</Abstract><MeSH>Breast Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Methylation</MeSH><MeSH>Databases, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Lung Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Isoforms</MeSH><MeSH>Survival Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptome</MeSH><MeSH>Zinc Fingers</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

To determine the full spectrum of NELF target genes in Drosophila, we performed a microarray analysis of S2 cells depleted of NELF and discovered that NELF RNAi affects many rapidly inducible genes involved in cellular responses to stimuli. Surprisingly, only one-third of NELF target genes were, like Hsp70, up-regulated by NELF-depletion, whereas the majority of target genes showed decreased expression levels upon NELF RNAi. Our data reveal that the presence of stalled Pol II at this latter group of genes enhances gene expression by maintaining a permissive chromatin architecture around the promoter-proximal region, and that loss of Pol II stalling at these promoters is accompanied by a significant increase in nucleosome occupancy and a decrease in histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation. These findings identify a novel, positive role for stalled Pol II in regulating gene expression and suggest that there is a dynamic interplay between stalled Pol II and chromatin structure.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Footprinting</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila melanogaster</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Dominant</MeSH><MeSH>Luciferases</MeSH><MeSH>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Polymerase II</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

However, most lncRNAs have not been functionally characterized. There is an urgent need to develop computational approaches for function annotation of increasing available lncRNAs. In this article, we propose a global network-based method, KATZLGO, to predict the functions of human lncRNAs at large scale. A global network is constructed by integrating three heterogeneous networks: lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network, and protein-protein interaction network. The KATZ measure is then employed to calculate similarities between lncRNAs and proteins in the global network. We annotate lncRNAs with Gene Ontology (GO) terms of their neighboring protein-coding genes based on the KATZ similarity scores. The performance of KATZLGO is evaluated on a manually annotated lncRNA benchmark and a protein-coding gene benchmark with known function annotations. KATZLGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art computational method both in maximum F-measure and coverage. Furthermore, we apply KATZLGO to predict functions of human lncRNAs and successfully map 12,318 human lncRNA genes to GO terms.</Abstract><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Ontology</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Statistical</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Long Noncoding</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>human lncRNAs protein-coding genes</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31896749"><Journal>Nature communications</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>In vivo functional analysis of non-conserved human lncRNAs associated with cardiometabolic traits.</Title><Abstract>Unlike protein-coding genes, the majority of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered non-conserved.

For secondary attack rate, the following medians were found for postexposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A, 85% (interquartile range (IQR), 28; n&#160;=&#160;5 sources); hepatitis B, 85% (IQR, 22; n&#160;=&#160;5 sources); measles, 83% (IQR, 21; n&#160;=&#160;8 sources); varicella, 67% (IQR: 48; n&#160;=&#160;9 sources); smallpox, 45% (IQR, 39; n&#160;=&#160;4 sources); and mumps, 38% (IQR, 7; n&#160;=&#160;2 sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the median vaccine postexposure efficacies were 100% (IQR, 0; n&#160;=&#160;6 sources) and 63% (IQR, 50; n&#160;=&#160;8 sources), respectively. Many available vaccines can modify or preclude disease if administered after exposure. This postexposure effectiveness could be important to consider during vaccine trials and while developing new vaccines.</Abstract><MeSH>Adolescent</MeSH><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Child</MeSH><MeSH>Child, Preschool</MeSH><MeSH>Communicable Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Infant</MeSH><MeSH>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH><MeSH>Vaccination</MeSH><MeSH>Young Adult</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Pathogenesis includes vasculopathy, inflammation, and fibrosis. Although immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil have shown some benefit in interstitial lung disease management, it is still a major cause of morbi-mortality in these patients. Therefore, there is a current need for new therapies. Here, we report a 65-year-old female patient with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, anti-topoisomerase-positive and extensive lung disease. The patient developed progressive lung fibrosis under several immunosuppressants and was started on nintedanib, with clinical and functional stabilization. Nintedanib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks several profibrotic pathways, inhibiting proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and decreasing the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It is approved for idiopathic lung fibrosis and has demonstrated good results in inhibiting migration and proliferation of systemic sclerosis dermal fibroblasts, constituting a promising agent for systemic sclerosis-associated lung fibrosis.</Abstract><MeSH>Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Indoles</MeSH><MeSH>Lung Diseases, Interstitial</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Scleroderma, Limited</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>nintedanib lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31732480"><Journal>EBioMedicine</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Endotype-phenotyping may predict a treatment response in progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease.</Title><Abstract>Some interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients develop a progressive fibrosing-ILD phenotype (PF-ILD), with similar persistent lung function decline suggesting common molecular pathways involved.

Side effects associated with selinexor include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hyponatremia. We reviewed 437 patients with multiple myeloma treated with selinexor and assessed the kinetics of adverse events and impact of supportive care measures. Selinexor reduced both platelets and neutrophils over the first cycle of treatment and reached a nadir between 28 and 42 days. Platelet transfusions and thrombopoietin receptor agonists were effective at treating thrombocytopenia, and granulocyte colony stimulating factors were effective at resolving neutropenia. The onset of gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) was most common during the first 1-2 weeks of treatment. Nausea could be mitigated with 5-HT3 antagonists and either neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, olanzapine, or cannbainoids. Loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate ameliorated diarrhea. The primary constitutional side effects of fatigue and decreased appetite could be managed with methylphenidate, megestrol, cannabinoids or olanzapine, respectively. Hyponatremia was highly responsive to sodium replacement.

The current approaches to the treatment of triple-class refractory disease are limited and include conventional chemotherapy, salvage autologous stem cell transplantation, and recycling previous regimens, each of which have generally had short-lived efficacy. It is anticipated that additional agents will be available for triple-refractory disease in the near future, including selinexor, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and next-generation monoclonal antibodies. The development and further refinement of novel treatments for this subset of patients should be considered a key clinical and research priority.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Between 1992 and 2013, 15 consecutive patients (age 20-54 years) with 62 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GKRS. Fifty-five percent of tumors involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx. The median prescription dose was 16&#160;Gy (range 13-20&#160;Gy). The median tumor diameter was 2.1&#160;cm (range 0.7-4.5&#160;cm). The median radiographic and clinical follow-up periods were 103 and 111 months, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year local controls were both 96&#8201;%. The disease specific survival was 93&#8201;% at 5 years and 68&#8201;% at 10 years. Fifty-three percent of patients had multiple meningiomas and received multiple GKRS treatments (range 1-7) for new or enlarging intracranial meningiomas. 11 (73&#8201;%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with 60 (97&#8201;%) tumors controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). There were 2 in-field failures, one at 1&#160;year and the other at 3.5 years. There were no marginal failures. Major Complications after GKRS included: 1 case of radiation necrosis, 1 case of post treatment edema, and 1 case of a presumed radiation induced cavernous malformation 5 years after GKRS. GK is an effective treatment for enlarging NF2-associated meningiomas. No cases of malignant transformation or secondary malignancies were seen during the follow-up period.</Abstract><MeSH>Adolescent</MeSH><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Child</MeSH><MeSH>Cohort Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Meningeal Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Meningioma</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Neurofibromin 2</MeSH><MeSH>Radiosurgery</MeSH><MeSH>Survival Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH><MeSH>Young Adult</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

UV exposure leads to persistent radicals that generate ROS over prolonged periods of time. Toward the goal of developing long-lasting antioxidants that can penetrate skin, we have designed a ROS-initiated protective (RIP) reagent that, upon reaction with ROS (antioxidant activity), self-cyclizes and then releases the natural product apocynin. Apocynin is a known antioxidant and inhibitor of NOX oxidase enzymes. A key phenol on the compound 1 controls ROS-initiated cyclization and makes 1 responsive to ROS with a EC50 comparable to common antioxidants in an ABTS assay. In an in vitro DNA nicking assay, the RIP reagent prevented DNA strand breaks. In cell-based assays, the reagent was not cytotoxic, apocynin was released only in cells treated with UVR, reduced UVR-induced cell death, and lowered DNA lesion formation. Finally, topical treatment of human skin explants with the RIP reagent reduced UV-induced DNA damage as monitored by quantification of cyclobutane dimer formation and DNA repair signaling via TP53. The reagent was more effective than administration of a catalase antioxidant on skin explants. This chemistry platform will expand the types of ROS-activated motifs and enable inhibitor release for potential use as a long-acting sunscreen.</Abstract><MeSH>Acetophenones</MeSH><MeSH>Administration, Topical</MeSH><MeSH>Antioxidants</MeSH><MeSH>Cells, Cultured</MeSH><MeSH>Cyclization</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Damage</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Keratinocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Oxidation-Reduction</MeSH><MeSH>Oxidative Stress</MeSH><MeSH>Reactive Oxygen Species</MeSH><MeSH>Skin</MeSH><MeSH>Ultraviolet Rays</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>ROS production UVR</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32158718"><Journal>Journal of biomedical physics &amp; engineering</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>The Bystander Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation and Mediators.</Title><Abstract>A bystander effect is biological changes in non-irradiated cells by transmitted signals from irradiated bystander cells, which causes the radiation toxic effects on the adjacent non-irradiated tissues.

Prolonged skin exposure to UVR results in DNA damage through oxidative stress due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are UV-absorbing compounds, found in many marine and freshwater organisms that have been of interest in use for skin protection. MAAs are involved in photoprotection from damaging UVR thanks to their ability to absorb light in both the UV-A (315-400 nm) and UV-B (280-315 nm) range without producing free radicals. In addition, by scavenging ROS, MAAs play an antioxidant role and suppress singlet oxygen-induced damage. Currently, there are over 30 different MAAs found in nature and they are characterised by different antioxidative and UV-absorbing capacities. Depending on the environmental conditions and UV level, up- or downregulation of genes from the MAA biosynthetic pathway results in seasonal fluctuation of the MAA content in aquatic species. This review will provide a summary of the MAA antioxidative and UV-absorbing features, including the genes involved in the MAA biosynthesis. Specifically, regulatory mechanisms involved in MAAs pathways will be evaluated for controlled MAA synthesis, advancing the potential use of MAAs in human skin protection.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Protoc. 2, 1467-1478 (2007); doi:10.1038/nprot.2007.148; published online 7 June 2007The ability to profile transcription and chromatin binding in a cell-type-specific manner is a powerful aid to understanding cell-fate specification and cellular function in multicellular organisms. We recently developed targeted DamID (TaDa) to enable genome-wide, cell-type-specific profiling of DNA- and chromatin-binding proteins in vivo without cell isolation. As a protocol extension, this article describes substantial modifications to an existing protocol, and it offers additional applications. TaDa builds upon DamID, a technique for detecting genome-wide DNA-binding profiles of proteins, by coupling it with the GAL4 system in Drosophila to enable both temporal and spatial resolution. TaDa ensures that Dam-fusion proteins are expressed at very low levels, thus avoiding toxicity and potential artifacts from overexpression. The modifications to the core DamID technique presented here also increase the speed of sample processing and throughput, and adapt the method to next-generation sequencing technology. TaDa is robust, reproducible and highly sensitive. Compared with other methods for cell-type-specific profiling, the technique requires no cell-sorting, cross-linking or antisera, and binding profiles can be generated from as few as 10,000 total induced cells. By profiling the genome-wide binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), TaDa can also identify transcribed genes in a cell-type-specific manner.

We recently developed targeted DamID (TaDa) to enable genome-wide, cell-type-specific profiling of DNA- and chromatin-binding proteins in vivo without cell isolation. As a protocol extension, this article describes substantial modifications to an existing protocol, and it offers additional applications. TaDa builds upon DamID, a technique for detecting genome-wide DNA-binding profiles of proteins, by coupling it with the GAL4 system in Drosophila to enable both temporal and spatial resolution. TaDa ensures that Dam-fusion proteins are expressed at very low levels, thus avoiding toxicity and potential artifacts from overexpression. The modifications to the core DamID technique presented here also increase the speed of sample processing and throughput, and adapt the method to next-generation sequencing technology. TaDa is robust, reproducible and highly sensitive. Compared with other methods for cell-type-specific profiling, the technique requires no cell-sorting, cross-linking or antisera, and binding profiles can be generated from as few as 10,000 total induced cells. By profiling the genome-wide binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), TaDa can also identify transcribed genes in a cell-type-specific manner.

These radioprotective agents can be classified into two broad groups, depending upon the presence or absence of a free or potentially free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been studied extensively and are thought to exert their radioprotective effects by several mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and hydrogen atom donation. Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities. In short, the study of amino acids and their derivatives as radioprotective agents continues to contribute to an understanding of processes involved in radiation toxicity and to offer new compounds with potential application to situations of human exposure. </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radioprotective compounds</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30361949"><Journal>Archives of pharmacal research</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>Pharmacology of natural radioprotectors.</Title><Abstract>Radiotherapy is one of the most efficient ways to treat cancer.

It remains unclear, however, how these layers of organization form, interact with one another and influence genome function. Here we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl in mouse liver leads to a marked reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated Hi-C peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. By contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the three-dimensional organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which helps to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Cycle Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosome Positioning</MeSH><MeSH>Enhancer Elements, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Epigenesis, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Liver</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription, Genetic</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

This pathway participates in the control of numerous processes including apoptosis, cell proliferation, the immune response, nervous system function, and RNA synthesis and processing. MEK1/2 activate human ERK1/2 by first catalyzing the phosphorylation of Y204/187 and then T202/185, both residues of which occur within the activation segment. The phosphorylation of both residues is required for enzyme activation. The only Raf substrates are MEK1/2 and the only MEK1/2 substrates are ERK1/2. In contrast, ERK1/2 catalyze the phosphorylation of many cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates including transcription factors and regulatory molecules. The linear MAP kinase pathway branches extensively at the ERK1/2 node. ERK1/2 are proline-directed kinases that preferentially catalyze the phosphorylation of substrates containing a PxS/TP sequence. The dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK1/2 is catalyzed by dual specificity phosphatases, protein-tyrosine specific phosphatases, and protein-serine/threonine phosphatases. The combined functions of kinases and phosphatases make the overall process reversible. To provide an idea of the complexities involved in these reactions, somatic cell cycle progression involves the strict timing of more than 32,000 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events as determined by mass spectrometry. The MAP kinase cascade is perhaps the most important oncogenic driver of human cancers and the blockade of this signalling module by targeted inhibitors is an important anti-tumor strategy. Although numerous cancers are driven by MAP kinase pathway activation, thus far the only orally effective approved drugs that target this signaling module are used for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas. The best treatments include the combination of B-Raf and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib, encorafenib and binimetinib, vemurafenib and cobimetanib). However, resistance to these antagonists occurs within one year and additional treatment options are necessary. Owing to the large variety of malignancies that are driven by dysregulation of the MAP kinase pathway, additional tumor types should be amenable to MAP kinase pathway inhibitor therapy. In addition to new B-Raf and MEK inhibitors, the addition of ERK inhibitors should prove helpful. Ulixertinib, MK-8353, and GDC-0994 are orally effective, potent, and specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 that are in early clinical trials for the treatment of various advanced/metastatic solid tumors. These agents are effective against cell lines that are resistant to B-Raf and MEK1/2 inhibitor therapy. Although MK-8353 does not directly inhibit MEK1/2, it decreases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as well as the phosphorylation of RSK, an ERK1/2 substrate. The decrease in RSK phosphorylation appears to be a result of ERK inhibition and the decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation is related to the inability of MEK to catalyze the phosphorylation of the ERK-MK-8353 complex; these decreases characterize the ERK dual mechanism inhibition paradigm. Additional work will be required to determine whether ERK inhibitors will be successful in the clinic and are able to forestall the development of drug resistance of the MAP kinase pathway.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antineoplastic Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Relationships between radiation exposure and risks of first and second primary cancers were quantified using Poisson regression. There was a similar linear dose-response relationship between radiation exposure and risks of both first and second primary solid tumors [excess relative risk (ERR)/Gy = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.74 and ERR/Gy = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80, respectively] and risk of both first and second primary leukemias (ERR/Gy = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.78-3.78 and ERR/Gy = 3.65; 95% CI, 0.96-10.70, respectively). Background incidence rates were higher for second solid cancers, compared with first solid cancers, until about age 70 years for men and 80 years for women (P &lt; 0.0001), but radiation-related ERRs did not differ between first and second primary solid cancers (P = 0.70). Radiation dose was most strongly related to risk of solid tumors that are radiation-sensitive including second primary lung, colon, female breast, thyroid, and bladder cancers. Radiation exposure confers equally high relative risks of second primary cancers as first primary cancers. Radiation is a potent carcinogen and those with substantial exposures who are diagnosed with a first primary cancer should be carefully screened for second primary cancers, particularly for cancers that are radiation-sensitive.</Abstract><MeSH>Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Aged, 80 and over</MeSH><MeSH>Cohort Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Japan</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms, Second Primary</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Warfare</MeSH><MeSH>Prospective Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Risk Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Sex Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Survivors</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cancers radiation exposure</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31069490"><Journal>Archives of gynecology and obstetrics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Second primary uterine malignancies after radiation therapy for cervical cancer.</Title><Abstract>Radiation exposure has long been established as a risk factor for cancer development.

In most eukaryotes, centromeres are epigenetically defined by the conserved histone H3 variant CENP-A. Proper centromere assembly is dependent upon the tight regulation of CENP-A level. Cell cycle regulation of CENP-A transcription appears to be a universal feature across eukaryotes, but the molecular mechanism underlying the temporal control of CENP-A transcription and how such regulation contributes to centromere function remains elusive. CENP-A in fission yeast has been shown to be transcribed before S phase. Using various synchronization methods, we confirmed that CENP-A transcription occurs at G1, leading to an almost twofold increase of the protein during S phase. Through a genetic screen, we identified the MBF (MluI box-binding factors) complex as a key regulator of temporal control of CENP-A transcription. The periodic transcription of CENP-A is lost in MBF mutants, resulting in CENP-A mislocalization and chromosome segregation defects. We identified the MCB (MluI cell cycle box) motif in the CENP-A promoter, and further showed that the MBF complex binds to the motif to restrict CENP-A transcription to G1. Mutations of the MCB motif cause constitutive CENP-A expression and deleterious effects on cell survival. Using promoters driving transcription to different cell cycle stages, we found that timing of CENP-A transcription is dispensable for its centromeric localization. Our data instead indicate that cell cycle-regulated CENP-A transcription is a key step to ensure that a proper amount of CENP-A is generated across generations. This study provides mechanistic insights into the regulation of cell cycle-dependent CENP-A transcription, as well as its importance on centromere function.</Abstract><MeSH>Cell Cycle</MeSH><MeSH>Centromere</MeSH><MeSH>Centromere Protein A</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Schizosaccharomyces</MeSH><MeSH>Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptional Activation</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>G1/S transcription factors yeast</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32343701"><Journal>PLoS genetics</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>The coordinate actions of calcineurin and Hog1 mediate the stress response through multiple nodes of the cell cycle network.</Title><Abstract>Upon exposure to environmental stressors, cells transiently arrest the cell cycle while they adapt and restore homeostasis.

The present review addresses diet-linked etiologies of hemochromatosis and their pathogenesis in the network of genes and nutrients. Although the mechanistic association to diet-linked etiologies can be complicated, the stress sentinels are pivotally involved in the pathological processes of secondary hemochromatosis in response to iron excess and other external stresses. Moreover, the mutations in these sentineling pathway-linked genes increase susceptibility to secondary hemochromatosis. Thus, the crosstalk between nutrients and genes would verify the complex procedures in the clinical outcomes of secondary hemochromatosis and chronic complications, such as malignancy.

It is a genetically heterogeneous disease caused by mutations in one or more different genes, the most common being mutations in the HFE gene. HFE hereditary hemochromatosis is mostly found in Europeans and is almost always a result of two mutations: C282Y and H63D. The H63D mutation is not as penetrant as the C282Y mutation, but there are rare reported cases of hereditary hemochromatosis with homozygous H63D genotype. While the C282Y mutation is primarily confined to persons of Northern European origin, the H63D mutation is spread worldwide. Other types of hereditary hemochromatosis are rare and broadly defined as non-HFE hereditary hemochromatosis and include mutations in the hemojuvelin gene, hepcidin (HAMP gene), transferrin receptor 2 gene, and ferroportin gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis is commonly found in populations of European origin; in contrast, it is rare and less well understood in Asia. It can be masked by the presence of concurrent iron deficiency or secondary iron overload in thalassemias.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Molecular basis of disease</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>Genetic cartography of longevity in humans and mice: Current landscape and horizons.</Title><Abstract>Aging is a complex and highly variable process. Heritability of longevity among humans and other species is low, and this finding has given rise to the idea that it may be futile to search for DNA variants that modulate aging. We argue that the problem in mapping longevity genes is mainly one of low power and the genetic and environmental complexity of aging. In this review we highlight progress made in mapping genes and molecular networks associated with longevity, paying special attention to work in mice and humans. We summarize 40&#8239;years of linkage studies using murine cohorts and 15&#8239;years of studies in human populations that have exploited candidate gene and genome-wide association methods. A small but growing number of gene variants contribute to known longevity mechanisms, but a much larger set have unknown functions. We outline these and other challenges and suggest some possible solutions, including more intense collaboration between research communities that use model organisms and human cohorts. Once hundreds of gene variants have been linked to differences in longevity in mammals, it will become feasible to systematically explore gene-by-environmental interactions, dissect mechanisms with more assurance, and evaluate the roles of epistasis and epigenetics in aging. A deeper understanding of complex networks-genetic, cellular, physiological, and social-should position us well to improve healthspan.</Abstract><MeSH>Adenylate Kinase</MeSH><MeSH>Aging</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosome Mapping</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Damage</MeSH><MeSH>Epigenesis, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Epigenomics</MeSH><MeSH>Epistasis, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Gene-Environment Interaction</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Linkage</MeSH><MeSH>Genome-Wide Association Study</MeSH><MeSH>Genomic Instability</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Insulin</MeSH><MeSH>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</MeSH><MeSH>Longevity</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Animal</MeSH><MeSH>Population</MeSH><MeSH>Proteostasis Deficiencies</MeSH><MeSH>Reactive Oxygen Species</MeSH><MeSH>Sirtuins</MeSH><MeSH>TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Telomere</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>PAI-1 longevity humans</QueryUsed><Result PMID="26330152"><Journal>Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990)</Journal><Year>2015</Year><Title>[Bats and Viruses: complex relationships].</Title><Abstract>With more than 1 200 species, bats and flying foxes (Order Chiroptera) constitute the most important and diverse order of Mammals after Rodents. Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera are so efficient reservoir hosts. Clearly, a great deal of additional work is needed to document the roles of bats in the natural history of viruses.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Chiroptera</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Reservoirs</MeSH><MeSH>Ecology</MeSH><MeSH>Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</MeSH><MeSH>Public Health</MeSH><MeSH>SARS Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Virus Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>Viruses</MeSH><MeSH>Zoonoses</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Growth arrest and apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were demonstrated in SARS-CoV 3CLpro -expressing human promonocyte cells. The fluorescence intensity of dihydrorhodamine 123 staining indicated that cellular reactive oxygen species were markedly increased in SARS-CoV 3CLpro -expressing cells. Moreover, in vivo signalling pathway assay indicated that 3CLpro increased the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent reporter, but inhibited activator protein-1-dependent transcription.

Yet others, including Friedreich's ataxia, are recessively inherited. A common feature is the presence of a DNA tandem repeat in the disease-associated gene and the propensity of the repeats to expand in germ and in somatic cells, with ensuing neurological and frequently also neuromuscular defects. Repeat expansion is the most frequent event in these diseases; however, sequence contractions, deletions, and mutations have also been reported. Nucleotide repeat sequences are predisposed to adopt non-B-DNA conformations, such as hairpins, cruciform, and intramolecular triple-helix structures (triplexes), also known as H-DNA. For gain-of-function disorders, oligonucleotides can be used to target either transcripts or duplex DNA and in diseases with recessive inheritance oligonucleotides may be used to alter repressive DNA or RNA conformations. Most current treatment strategies are aimed at altering transcript levels, but therapies directed against DNA are also emerging, and novel strategies targeting DNA, instead of RNA, are described. Different mechanisms using modified oligonucleotides are discussed along with the structural aspects of repeat sequences, which can influence binding modes and efficiencies.</Abstract><MeSH>Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>Fragile X Syndrome</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Huntington Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Neurodegenerative Diseases</MeSH><MeSH>Nucleic Acid Conformation</MeSH><MeSH>Oligonucleotides</MeSH><MeSH>Tandem Repeat Sequences</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Huntington's disease recessive gene</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31871190"><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Chorea-related mutations in PDE10A result in aberrant compartmentalization and functionality of the enzyme.</Title><Abstract>A robust body of evidence supports the concept that phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) activity in the basal ganglia orchestrates the control of coordinated movement in human subjects.

Systemic mapping of start-codon positions and precise measurement of the corresponding initiation rate would transform our understanding of translational control. Here we present quantitative translation initiation sequencing (QTI-seq), with which the initiating ribosomes can be profiled in real time at single-nucleotide resolution. Resultant initiation maps not only delineated variations of start-codon selection but also highlighted a dynamic range of initiation rates in response to nutrient starvation. The integrated data set provided unique insights into principles of alternative translation and mechanisms controlling different aspects of translation initiation. With RiboTag mice, QTI-seq permitted tissue-specific profiling of initiating ribosomes in vivo. Liver cell-specific ribosome profiling uncovered a robust translational reprogramming of the proteasome system in fasted mice.

They play diverse roles in reward and aversion, suggesting that they be comprised of several functionally distinct sub-groups, but our understanding of this diversity has been limited by a lack of molecular markers that might provide genetic entry points for cell type-specific investigations. To address this, we conducted transcriptional profiling of GABA neurons and dopamine neurons using immunoprecipitation of tagged polyribosomes (RiboTag) and RNAseq. First, we directly compared these two transcriptomes in order to obtain a list of genes enriched in GABA neurons compared with dopamine neurons. Next, we created a novel bioinformatic approach, that used the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) gene ontology database and VTA gene expression data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, from which we obtained 6 candidate genes: Cbln4, Rxfp3, Rora, Gpr101, Trh and Nrp2. As a final step, we verified the selective expression of these candidate genes in sub-groups of GABA neurons in the VTA (and neighbouring substantia nigra pars compacta) using immunolabelling. Taken together, our study provides a valuable toolbox for the future investigation of GABA neuron sub-groups in the VTA.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Senescent cells have a unique gene expression profile that is frequently accompanied by senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). Protein kinase CK2 (CK2) downregulation can induce trimethylation of histone H3 Lys 9 (H3K9me3) and SAHFs formation by activating SUV39h1. Here, we present evidence that the PI3K-AKTmTOR-reactive oxygen species-p53 pathway is necessary for CK2 downregulation-mediated H3K9me3 and SAHFs formation. CK2 downregulation promotes SUV39h1 stability by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation in a p53dependent manner. Moreover, the dephosphorylation status of Ser 392 on p53, a possible CK2 target site, enhances the nuclear import and subsequent stabilization of SUV39h1 by inhibiting the interactions between p53, MDM2, and SUV39h1.

Glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 were divided into four groups and treated with control, LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA, AZD0530, and combined LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA with AZD0530, respectively. The proliferation and apoptotic capacity of glioblastoma cells was assessed by Cell Counting Kit&#8209;8 and double staining flow cytometry assays, respectively. Additionally, the potential effect of LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 on glioblastoma was evaluated in&#160;vivo. Images were captured of the tumor formation in mice every week. Following three weeks of treatment, NMR scan and immunohistochemistry were performed. The treatment of combined LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 was more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosisof glioblastoma cells in comparison with the treatment of either LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 alone. Although LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 treatment alone suppressed tumor growth in mice, the combined treatment had a more significant effect than the treatment of LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 alone. According to the results of both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo assays, a combined therapy of LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA with AZD0530 could enhance therapeutic effects on glioblastoma, supporting the idea that the combination of LV&#8209;STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 could serve as a novel and effective strategy to combat glioblastoma.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antineoplastic Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Benzodioxoles</MeSH><MeSH>Brain Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Proliferation</MeSH><MeSH>Combined Modality Therapy</MeSH><MeSH>Glioblastoma</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Inbred BALB C</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Nude</MeSH><MeSH>Quinazolines</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Small Interfering</MeSH><MeSH>RNAi Therapeutics</MeSH><MeSH>STAT3 Transcription Factor</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>AZD0530</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30536923"><Journal>Addiction biology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>The Fyn kinase inhibitor, AZD0530, suppresses mouse alcohol self-administration and seeking.</Title><Abstract>Fyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that plays an important role not only in normal synaptic functions but also in brain pathologies including alcohol use disorder.

However, its role and the mechanisms of its binding in the chromosome arms (ChAs) remain largely unclear. Here, we identified HP1a-interacting domains in the somatic cells of Drosophila ovaries using a DamID-seq approach and compared them with insertion sites of transposable elements (TEs) revealed by genome sequencing. Although HP1a domains cover only 13% of ChAs, they non-randomly associate with 42% of TE insertions. Furthermore, HP1a on average propagates at 2-kb distances from the TE insertions. These data confirm the role of TEs in formation of HP1a islands in ChAs. However, only 18% of HP1a domains have adjacent TEs, indicating the existence of other mechanisms of HP1a domain formation besides spreading from TEs. In particular, many TE-independent HP1a domains correspond to the regions attached to the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) or contain active gene promoters. However, HP1a occupancy on the promoters does not significantly influence expression of corresponding genes. At the same time, the steady-state transcript level of many genes located outside of HP1a domains was altered upon HP1a knockdown in the somatic cells of ovaries, thus pointing to the strong indirect effect of HP1a depletion. Collectively, our results support an existence of at least three different mechanisms of HP1a domain emergence in ChAs: spreading from TE insertions, transient interactions with the chromatin located near NPCs, and targeting to the promoters of moderately expressed genes.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>effect HP1a protein chromatin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31420927"><Journal>Genes, brain, and behavior</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>The mode of action of Fruitless: Is it an easy matter to switch the sex?</Title><Abstract>The fruitless (fru) locus was originally defined by a male sterile mutation that promotes male-to-male courtship while suppressing male-to-female courtship in Drosophila melanogaster.

Given this potential of MEK inhibition as an effective medical therapy, the use of targeted agents in the NF1 population is likely to increase substantially. For clinicians with limited experience prescribing MEK inhibitors, concern about managing these treatments may be a barrier to use. In this manuscript, the Clinical Care Advisory Board of the Children's Tumor Foundation reviews the published experience with MEK inhibitors in NF1 and outlines recommendations for side-effect management, as well as monitoring guidelines. These recommendations can serve as a beginning framework for NF providers seeking to provide the most effective treatments for their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) clinical care is on the cusp of a transformative shift. With the success of recent clinical trials using MEK inhibitors, an increasing number of NF1 patients are being treated with MEK inhibitors for both plexiform neurofibromas and low-grade gliomas. The use of MEK inhibitors is likely to increase substantially with the expected upcoming approval of selumetinib for a specific indication for treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. Given these changes, the Clinical Care Advisory Board of the Children's Tumor Foundation has identified a need within the NF1 clinical community for guidance for the safe and effective use of MEK inhibitors for NF1-related tumors. This article provides a review of the published experience of MEK inhibitors in NF1 and provides recommendations for monitoring and management of side effects.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

We show that Satb1 alternative promoters exhibit lineage-specific chromatin accessibility during T-cell development from progenitors. Furthermore, TCF1 regulates the Satb1 P2 promoter switch during CD4SP development, via direct binding to the Satb1 P2 promoter. CD4SP T cells from TCF1 KO mice exhibit downregulation of P2 transcript variant expression as well as low levels of SATB1 protein. Collectively, these results provide unequivocal evidence toward alternative promoter switch-mediated developmental stage-specific regulation of SATB1 in thymocytes.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>SATB1 expressed thymocytes</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32392347"><Journal>Nucleic acids research</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Dynamic regulation of chromatin organizer SATB1 via TCR-induced alternative promoter switch during T-cell development.</Title><Abstract>The chromatin organizer SATB1 is highly enriched in thymocytes and is essential for T-cell development. Although SATB1 regulates a large number of genes important for T-cell development, the mechanism(s) regulating expression of SATB1 during this process remain elusive. Using chromatin immune precipitation-seq-based occupancy profiles of H3K4me3 and H3Kme1 at Satb1 gene locus, we predicted four different alternative promoters of Satb1 in mouse thymocytes and characterized them. The expression of Satb1 transcript variants with distinct 5' UTRs occurs in a stage-specific manner during T-cell development and is dependent on TCR signaling.

Recent data implicate dysregulated SATB1 expression in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides, the most frequent variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here, we report on a disease stage-associated decrease of SATB1 expression and an inverse expression of STAT5 and SATB1 in situ. STAT5 inhibited SATB1 expression through induction of microRNA-155. Decreased SATB1 expression triggered enhanced expression of IL-5 and IL-9 (but not IL-6 and IL-32), whereas increased SATB1 expression had the opposite effect, indicating that the microRNA-155 target SATB1 is a repressor of IL-5 and IL-9 in malignant T cells. In accordance, inhibition of STAT5 and its upstream activator JAK3 triggered increased SATB1 expression and a concomitant suppression of IL-5 and IL-9 expression in malignant T cells. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic link between the proto-oncogenic JAK3/STAT5/microRNA-155 pathway, SATB1, and cytokines linked to CTCL severity and progression, indicating that SATB1 dysregulation is involved in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis.</Abstract><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Cohort Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Progression</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Knockdown Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Interleukin-5</MeSH><MeSH>Interleukin-9</MeSH><MeSH>Janus Kinase 3</MeSH><MeSH>Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>MicroRNAs</MeSH><MeSH>Mycosis Fungoides</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasm Staging</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Small Interfering</MeSH><MeSH>STAT5 Transcription Factor</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Skin Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>T-Lymphocytes</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

To more accurately assess internal dose after ITB, practical dosimetry methods were proposed that consider the ITB effect in a dosimetric manner. A method using the ratio of urine excretion to thyroid retention activity was proposed to retrospectively determine individual-specific ITB levels; bioassay functions and dose coefficients corresponding to ITB levels were calculated separately using the latest biokinetic model and fundamental data. Moreover, insensitive measurement points of time, which led to similar results regardless of ITB level, were determined based on the dose per unit content. Proposed insensitive points for inhalation of vapour forms and particulate forms, respectively, were 1.5 days and 2 days after exposure.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

JDM was characterized by typical rashes, including Gottron papules, heliotrope rash, malar rash, periungual capillary changes, and other photosensitive and vasculopathic skin rashes. JPM was characterized by more severe weakness, higher creatine kinase levels, falling episodes, and more frequent cardiac disease. JCTM had more frequent interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia, and malar rash. Differences in autoantibody frequency were also evident, with anti-p155/140, anti-MJ, and anti-Mi-2 seen more frequently in patients with JDM, anti-signal recognition particle and anti-Jo-1 in JPM, and anti-U1-RNP, PM-Scl, and other myositis-associated autoantibodies more commonly present in JCTM.

Although juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), the most common form of JIIM, has been well studied, the other major clinical subgroups of JIIM, including juvenile polymyositis (JPM) and juvenile myositis overlapping with another autoimmune or connective tissue disease (JCTM), have not been well characterized, and their similarity to the adult clinical subgroups is unknown. We enrolled 436 patients with JIIM, including 354 classified as JDM, 33 as JPM, and 49 as JCTM, in a nationwide registry study. The aim of the study was to compare demographics; clinical features; laboratory measures, including myositis autoantibodies; and outcomes among these clinical subgroups, as well as with published data on adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) enrolled in a separate natural history study. We used random forest classification and logistic regression modeling to compare clinical subgroups, following univariate analysis. JDM was characterized by typical rashes, including Gottron papules, heliotrope rash, malar rash, periungual capillary changes, and other photosensitive and vasculopathic skin rashes. JPM was characterized by more severe weakness, higher creatine kinase levels, falling episodes, and more frequent cardiac disease. JCTM had more frequent interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia, and malar rash. Differences in autoantibody frequency were also evident, with anti-p155/140, anti-MJ, and anti-Mi-2 seen more frequently in patients with JDM, anti-signal recognition particle and anti-Jo-1 in JPM, and anti-U1-RNP, PM-Scl, and other myositis-associated autoantibodies more commonly present in JCTM. Mortality was highest in patients with JCTM, whereas hospitalizations and wheelchair use were highest in JPM patients. Several demographic and clinical features were shared between juvenile and adult IIM subgroups. However, JDM and JPM patients had a lower frequency of interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, "mechanic's hands" and carpal tunnel syndrome, and lower mortality than their adult counterparts.

In follow-up to our study defining the major clinical subgroup phenotypes of JIIM, we compared demographics, clinical features, laboratory measures, and outcomes among myositis-specific autoantibody (MSA) subgroups, as well as with published data on adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients enrolled in a separate natural history study. In the present study, of 430 patients enrolled in a nationwide registry study who had serum tested for myositis autoantibodies, 374 had either a single specific MSA (n = 253) or no identified MSA (n = 121) and were the subject of the present report. Following univariate analysis, we used random forest classification and exact logistic regression modeling to compare autoantibody subgroups. Anti-p155/140 autoantibodies were the most frequent subgroup, present in 32% of patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) or overlap myositis with JDM, followed by anti-MJ autoantibodies, which were seen in 20% of JIIM patients, primarily in JDM. Other MSAs, including anti-synthetase, anti-signal recognition particle (SRP), and anti-Mi-2, were present in only 10% of JIIM patients. Features that characterized the anti-p155/140 autoantibody subgroup included Gottron papules, malar rash, "shawl-sign" rash, photosensitivity, cuticular overgrowth, lowest creatine kinase (CK) levels, and a predominantly chronic illness course. The features that differed for patients with anti-MJ antibodies included muscle cramps, dysphonia, intermediate CK levels, a high frequency of hospitalization, and a monocyclic disease course. Patients with anti-synthetase antibodies had higher frequencies of interstitial lung disease, arthralgia, and "mechanic's hands," and had an older age at diagnosis. The anti-SRP group, which had exclusively juvenile polymyositis, was characterized by high frequencies of black race, severe onset, distal weakness, falling episodes, Raynaud phenomenon, cardiac involvement, high CK levels, chronic disease course, frequent hospitalization, and wheelchair use. Characteristic features of the anti-Mi-2 subgroup included Hispanic ethnicity, classic dermatomyositis and malar rashes, high CK levels, and very low mortality. Finally, the most common features of patients without any currently defined MSA or myositis-associated autoantibodies included linear extensor erythema, arthralgia, and a monocyclic disease course.

Deregulated parent-of-origin specific genes cause the response to interploidy hybridizations, revealing an epigenetic basis of this phenomenon. In this study, we present evidence that paternal hypomethylation can bypass the interploidy hybridization barrier by alleviating the requirement for the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in the endosperm. PRC2 epigenetically regulates gene expression by applying methylation marks on histone H3. Bypass of the barrier is mediated by suppressed expression of imprinted genes. We show that the hypomethylated pollen genome causes de novo CHG methylation directed to FIS-PRC2 target genes, suggesting that different epigenetic modifications can functionally substitute for each other.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a gene silencer that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3, is stimulated upon recognition of its own catalytic product and has been shown to be more active on dinucleosomes than H3 tails or single nucleosomes. These properties probably facilitate local H3K27me2/3 spreading, causing heterochromatin formation and gene repression. Here, cryo-EM reconstructions of human PRC2 bound to bifunctional dinucleosomes show how a single PRC2, via interactions with nucleosomal DNA, positions the H3 tails of the activating and substrate nucleosome to interact with the EED subunit and the SET domain of EZH2, respectively. We show how the geometry of the PRC2-DNA interactions allows PRC2 to accommodate varying lengths of the linker DNA between nucleosomes.

Indirect hemagglutination test with the sera of 99 patients suffering from generalized forms of meningococcus infection was conducted with the mentioned preparations in Moscow and Novosibirsk in 1974--1975 when a stable morbidity decline was noted in these towns after an epidemic rise. The diagnostic value of this test was confirmed: it permitted to diagnose meningococcus etiology beginning from the 5th day of the disease and to decipher it from the aspect of individual serological groups. As shown, the incidence of cases caused by serological group A, reaching 87% at the height of the epidemic rise, fell to 49.5% at the stage of decline. Cases caused by group Y which was not encountered formerly were revealed in 16.2% of the patients. Among 127 patients with miningitis of nonmeningococcus etiology meningococcus antibodies to groups A and Y were revealed with the same frequency (in titres of not over 1 : 20--1 : 80), but the leading role of serological group A in the etiology of the manifest forms permitted to draw a conclusion on the presence of a higher invasiveness in the strains of group A.</Abstract><MeSH>Hemagglutination Tests</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Meningococcal Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Moscow</MeSH><MeSH>Serotyping</MeSH><MeSH>Siberia</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

They display a wide variety of complex and beautiful shapes, most of which have evolved for a particular physiological reason and are adapted to accommodate certain cellular demands. In membrane trafficking events, the dynamic remodelling of cellular membranes is apparent. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis for example, the plasma membrane undergoes heavy deformation to generate and internalize a highly curved clathrin-coated vesicle. This process has become a model system to study proteins with the ability to sense and induce membrane curvature and over the last two decades numerous membrane remodelling molecules and molecular mechanisms have been identified in this process. In this review, we discuss the interaction of epsin1 ENTH domain with membranes, which is one of the best-studied examples of a peripheral and transiently membrane bending protein important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process protein clathrin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="9420248"><Journal>Journal of virology</Journal><Year>1998</Year><Title>Interaction of the bovine papillomavirus E6 protein with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1.</Title><Abstract>The E6 gene of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) is expressed in fibropapillomas caused by BPV-1 and in tissue culture cells transformed by BPV-1. It encodes one of the two major oncoproteins of BPV-1. In this study, we demonstrate an interaction between the BPV-1 E6 protein and AP-1, the TGN (trans-Golgi network)-specific clathrin adaptor complex. AP-1 is a four-subunit protein complex required for clathrin-mediated cellular transport from the TGN. The AP-1/E6 interaction was observed in vitro and in cells. The E6 binding site on AP-1 was mapped to the N-terminal trunk domain of the gamma subunit. BPV-1 E6 preferentially associated with membrane-bound AP-1 in cells but not with free cytosolic AP-1. BPV-1 E6 was further shown to be recruited to isolated Golgi membranes and to copurify with clathrin-coated vesicles. The recruitment of BPV-1 E6 to Golgi membranes was AP-1 independent, but the E6 interaction with AP-1 was required for its association with clathrin-coated vesicles. Furthermore, AP-1 proteins could compete with BPV-1 E6 for binding to Golgi membranes, suggesting that the recruitment of BPV-1 E6 and AP-1 to Golgi membranes involves a common factor. Taken together, our results suggest that cytosolic BPV-1 E6 is first recruited to the TGN, where it is then recognized by membrane-bound AP-1 and subsequently recruited into TGN-derived clathrin-coated vesicles. We propose that BPV-1 E6, through its interaction with AP-1, can affect cellular processes involving clathrin-mediated trafficking pathway.</Abstract><MeSH>Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits</MeSH><MeSH>Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport</MeSH><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Binding Sites</MeSH><MeSH>Bovine papillomavirus 1</MeSH><MeSH>Cattle</MeSH><MeSH>Clathrin</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Golgi Apparatus</MeSH><MeSH>In Vitro Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Membrane Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Membranes</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Oncogene Proteins, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process protein clathrin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30872642"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Clathrin Adaptor Complex-interacting Protein Irc6 Functions through the Conserved C-Terminal Domain.</Title><Abstract>Clathrin coats drive transport vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and in pathways between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes.

This unit defines computational prediction of intrinsic disorder, summarizes major types of predictors of disorder, and provides details about three accurate and recently released methods. We demonstrate the use of these methods to predict intrinsic disorder for several illustrative proteins, provide insights into how predictions should be interpreted, and quantify and discuss predictive performance. Predictions can be freely and conveniently obtained using webservers. We point to the availability of databases that provide access to annotations of intrinsic disorder determined by structural studies and putative intrinsic disorder pre-computed by computational methods.

The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of peripheral administration of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R/TACR3, a receptor for neurokinin B) antagonist, SB223412, on GnRH pulse-generating activity and pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in ovariectomized Shiba goats treated with luteal phase levels of estrogen. The NK3R antagonist was infused intravenously for 4 h {0.16 or 1.6 mg/(kg body weight [BW]&#183;4 h)} during which multiple unit activity (MUA) in the ARC was recorded, an electrophysiological technique commonly employed to monitor GnRH pulse generator activity. In a separate experiment, the NK3R antagonist (40 or 200 mg/[kg BW&#183;day]) was administered orally for 7 days to determine whether the NK3R antagonist could modulate pulsatile LH secretion when administered via the oral route. Intravenous infusion of the NK3R antagonist significantly increased the interval of episodic bursts of MUA compared with that of the controls. Oral administration of the antagonist for 7 days also significantly prolonged the interpulse interval of LH pulses. The results of this study demonstrate that peripheral administration of an NK3R antagonist suppresses pulsatile LH secretion by acting on the GnRH pulse generator, suggesting that NK3R antagonist administration could be used to modulate reproductive functions in ruminants.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>NK3R antagonists</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30504731"><Journal>Neuroendocrinology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Neurokinin 3 Receptor Antagonism: A Novel Treatment for Menopausal Hot Flushes.</Title><Abstract>Menopause is associated with significant symptomatic burden, with approximately two-thirds of postmenopausal women suffering from vasomotor symptoms, hot flushes, and night sweats.

BCL11B, associated with SCZ in genome-wide association study (GWAS), is a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and development of cells in the central nervous and immune systems. Here, we use functional genomics data from studies of BCL11B to investigate the contribution of neuronal and immune processes to SCZ pathophysiology. We identified the gene targets of BCL11B in brain striatal cells (n = 223 genes), double negative 4 (DN4) developing T cells (n = 114 genes) and double positive (DP) developing T cells (n = 518 genes) using an integrated analysis of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data. No gene-set was enriched for genes containing common variants associated with SCZ but the DP gene-set was enriched for genes containing missense de novo mutations (DNMs; p = .001) using data from 3,447 SCZ trios. Post hoc analysis revealed the enrichment to be stronger for DP genes negatively regulated by BCL11B. Biological processes enriched for genes negatively regulated by BCL11B in DP gene-set included immune system development and cytokine signaling. These analyses, leveraging a GWAS-identified SCZ risk gene and data on gene expression and transcription factor binding, indicate that DNMs in immune pathways contribute to SCZ risk.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>BCL11B schizophrenia</QueryUsed><Result PMID="27762073"><Journal>American journal of medical genetics.

These processes when perturbed are thought to contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology. A core feature of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction. For genetic disorders where cognitive impairment is more severe such as intellectual disability, there are a disproportionally high number of genes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Evidence now supports some shared genetic aetiology between schizophrenia and intellectual disability. GWAS have identified 108 chromosomal regions associated with schizophrenia risk that span 350 genes. This study identified genes mapping to those loci that have epigenetic functions, and tested the risk alleles defining those loci for association with cognitive deficits. We developed a list of 350 genes with epigenetic functions and cross-referenced this with the GWAS loci. This identified eight candidate genes: BCL11B, CHD7, EP300, EPC2, GATAD2A, KDM3B, RERE, SATB2. Using a dataset of Irish psychosis cases and controls (n&#8201;=&#8201;1235), the schizophrenia risk SNPs at these loci were tested for effects on IQ, working memory, episodic memory, and attention. Strongest associations were for rs6984242 with both measures of IQ (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) and episodic memory (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.007). We link rs6984242 to CHD7 via a long range eQTL. These associations were not replicated in independent samples. Our study highlights that a number of genes mapping to risk loci for schizophrenia may function as epigenetic regulators of gene expression but further studies are required to establish a role for these genes in cognition. &#169; 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Alleles</MeSH><MeSH>Brain</MeSH><MeSH>Cognition</MeSH><MeSH>Cognition Disorders</MeSH><MeSH>Epigenesis, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Epigenomics</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Frequency</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Genome-Wide Association Study</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Ireland</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Memory, Short-Term</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeSH><MeSH>Psychotic Disorders</MeSH><MeSH>Risk Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Schizophrenia</MeSH><MeSH>Schizophrenic Psychology</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

However, the mechanisms by which E2 and Brd4 activate viral transcription are still not completely understood. In this study, we show that recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a functional interaction partner of Brd4 in transcription activation, is important for E2's transcription activation activity.

We previously reported that repeated cycles of binge drinking and withdrawal activate Fyn in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of rodents, and that Fyn signaling in the DMS contributes to rat alcohol intake and relapse. Here, we used AZD0530, a CNS penetrable inhibitor of Src PTKs developed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and cancer and tested its efficacy to suppress alcohol-dependent molecular and behavioral effects. We show that systemic administration of AZD0530 prevents alcohol-induced Fyn activation and GluN2B phosphorylation in the DMS of mice. We further report that a single dose of AZD0530 reduces alcohol operant self-administration and promotes extinction of alcohol self-administration without altering basal and dopamine D1 receptor-dependent locomotion. Together, our findings suggest that AZD0530, through its inhibitory actions on Fyn kinase, dampens alcohol seeking and drinking.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

By combining chromosomal ablation in Drosophila with microarray analysis, we characterized the basis of this integration. We show that the expression profile for at least one third of zygotically active genes is coupled to the concomitant degradation of the corresponding maternal mRNAs. The embryo uses transcription and degradation to generate localized patterns of expression, and zygotic transcription to degrade distinct classes of maternal transcripts. Although degradation does not appear to involve a simple regulatory code, the activation of the zygotic genome starts from intronless genes sharing a common cis-element. This cis-element interacts with a single protein, the Bicoid stability factor, and acts as a potent enhancer capable of timing the activity of an exogenous transactivator. We propose that this regulatory mode links morphogen gradients with temporal regulation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosome Deletion</MeSH><MeSH>Down-Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila melanogaster</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>RNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptional Activation</MeSH><MeSH>Zygote</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Drosophila embryos maternal genome mRNA</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30977698"><Journal>Open biology</Journal><Year>2018</Year><Title>Regulatory principles governing the maternal-to-zygotic transition: insights from Drosophila melanogaster.</Title><Abstract>The onset of metazoan development requires that two terminally differentiated germ cells, a sperm and an oocyte, become reprogrammed to the totipotent embryo, which can subsequently give rise to all the cell types of the adult organism. In nearly all animals, maternal gene products regulate the initial events of embryogenesis while the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally silent. Developmental control is then passed from mother to zygote through a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT comprises an intimately connected set of molecular events that mediate degradation of maternally deposited mRNAs and transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. This essential developmental transition is conserved among metazoans but is perhaps best understood in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this article, we will review our understanding of the events that drive the MZT in Drosophila embryos and highlight parallel mechanisms driving this transition in other animals.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Drosophila melanogaster</MeSH><MeSH>Embryonic Development</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Stability</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger, Stored</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptional Activation</MeSH><MeSH>Zygote</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Drosophila embryos maternal genome mRNA</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32579915"><Journal>Cell reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Precise Temporal Regulation of Post-transcriptional Repressors Is Required for an Orderly Drosophila Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition.</Title><Abstract>In animal embryos, the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) hands developmental control from maternal to zygotic gene products.

Aimovig (erenumab; erenumab-aooe in the United States) is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy against the CGRP receptor (CGRPR) for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig is also the first FDA-approved mAb against a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Here, we report the architecture and functional attributes of erenumab critical for its potent antagonism against CGRPR. The crystal structure of erenumab in complex with CGRPR reveals a direct ligand-blocking mechanism, enabled by a remarkable 21-residue-long complementary determining region (CDR)-H3 loop, which adopts a tyrosine-rich helix-turn tip and projects into the deep interface of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and RAMP1 subunits of CGRPR. Furthermore, erenumab engages with residues specific to CLR and RAMP1, providing the molecular basis for its exquisite selectivity. Such structural insights reveal the drug action mechanism of erenumab and shed light on developing antibody therapeutics targeting GPCRs.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>erenumab</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31876735"><Journal>Medicine</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Erenumab safety and efficacy in migraine: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.</Title><Abstract>Erenumab is a new medicine recently approved in the United States of America for the preventive treatment of migraine among adults.

The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.</Abstract><MeSH>Antibodies, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Infectious bronchitis virus</MeSH><MeSH>Isoelectric Point</MeSH><MeSH>Species Specificity</MeSH><MeSH>Viral Structural Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Virology</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function viral peplomer</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32653736"><Journal>Medical hypotheses</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19: A possibility.</Title><Abstract>Hand hygiene by washing with soap and water is recommended for the prevention of COVID-19 spread.

The nanomedicine is synthesized by a simple and reproducible ionotropic gelification method that results in the efficient loading of the positively charged IRW within the dermatan sulfate/ chitosan matrix, as demonstrated by ss-NMR spectroscopy. The incorporation of IRW results in a stable nanoparticle dispersion with a single size population of 442&#8239;&#177;&#8239;43&#8239;nm. Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrate the capacity of the nanomaterial to distinguish between a quiescent and an injured endothelium through the interaction of dermatan sulfate with the CD44 receptor. Remarkably, no additional surface functionalization is required as dermatan sulfate mediates their internalization and the intracellular release of this natural anti-inflammatory tripeptide to modulate endothelial inflammatory response.

Proton therapy has been shown to reduce the predicted risk of second cancer when compared to intensity modulated radiotherapy. However, it is unknown if this is also true for the rotational therapies proton arc therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The objective of this study was to compare the predicted risk of cancer following proton arc therapy and VMAT for prostate cancer. Proton arc therapy and VMAT plans were created for three patients. Various risk models were combined with the dosimetric data (therapeutic and stray dose) to predict the excess relative risk (ERR) of cancer in the bladder and rectum. Ratios of ERR values (RRR) from proton arc therapy and VMAT were calculated. RRR values ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, and all RRR values were shown to be statistically less than 1, except for the value calculated with the linear-non-threshold risk model. We conclude that the predicted risk of cancer in the bladder or rectum following proton arc therapy for prostate cancer is either less than or approximately equal to the risk following VMAT, depending on which risk model is applied.</Abstract><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Monte Carlo Method</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced</MeSH><MeSH>Organs at Risk</MeSH><MeSH>Prostatic Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Proton Therapy</MeSH><MeSH>Radiotherapy Dosage</MeSH><MeSH>Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated</MeSH><MeSH>Rectal Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Risk</MeSH><MeSH>Scattering, Radiation</MeSH><MeSH>Urinary Bladder Neoplasms</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>radiotherapy prostate cancer increase bladder cancer risk</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31284326"><Journal>International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Particle therapy for prostate cancer: The past, present and future.</Title><Abstract>Although prostate cancer control using radiotherapy is dose-dependent, dose-volume effects on late toxicities in organs at risk, such as the rectum and bladder, have been observed. Both protons and carbon ions offer advantageous physical properties for radiotherapy, and create favorable dose distributions using fewer portals compared with photon-based radiotherapy. Thus, particle beam therapy using protons and carbon ions theoretically seems suitable for dose escalation and reduced risk of toxicity. However, it is difficult to evaluate the superiority of particle beam radiotherapy over photon beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, as no clinical trials have directly compared the outcomes between the two types of therapy due to the limited number of facilities using particle beam therapy. The Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology organized a joint effort among research groups to establish standardized treatment policies and indications for particle beam therapy according to disease, and multicenter prospective studies have been planned for several common cancers. Clinical trials of proton beam therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer and carbon-ion therapy for high-risk prostate cancer have already begun. As particle beam therapy for prostate cancer is covered by the Japanese national health insurance system as of April 2018, and the number of facilities practicing particle beam therapy has increased recently, the number of prostate cancer patients treated with particle beam therapy in Japan is expected to increase drastically. Here, we review the results from studies of particle beam therapy for prostate cancer and discuss future developments in this field.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radiotherapy prostate cancer increase bladder cancer risk</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32408293"><Journal>Physics in medicine and biology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Standard versus hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: assessing the impact on dose modulation and normal tissue effects when using patient-specific cancer biology.</Title><Abstract>Hypofractionation of prostate cancer radiotherapy achieves tumour control at lower total radiation doses, however, increased rectal and bladder toxicities have been observed. To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:&lt;0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy. However, to exploit the radiobiological advantages given by hypofractionation, greater attention to geometric accuracy is required due to increased sensitivity to treatment uncertainties.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radiotherapy prostate cancer increase bladder cancer risk</QueryUsed><Result PMID="27000927"><Journal>Journal of robotic surgery</Journal><Year>2013</Year><Title>Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy after aborted retropubic radical prostatectomy.</Title><Abstract>Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has surged in popularity since US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2000.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurological syndrome (ICANS) are recognized toxicities of CAR-T, while kidney injury remains less recognized. The objective of this study was to identify the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) post CAR-T cell therapy, potential risk factors, and kidney function recovery. We performed a retrospective review of 46 adult patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with CAR-T therapy from February 2018 to February 2019 at our institution. Serum creatinine values prior to CAR-T therapy through day 100 were used to assess AKI, as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria: grade 1 (1.5 - &lt; 2-fold), grade 2 (2 - &lt; 3-fold), and grade 3 (&#8805; 3-fold) baseline. CRS and ICANS were graded using the consensus criteria by the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. The overall incidence of CRS was 78.3% (95% CI 66-90.5%) of which 13% (95% CI 3.3-22.8%) developed grade 3-4 CRS, while overall incidence of ICANS was lower at 45.7% (95% CI 3.1-60.3%). The cumulative incidence of any grade AKI by day 100 was 30% (95%CI 16.9-43.9%) with grade 1 AKI incidence at 21.7% (95%CI 9.7-33.8%) and grade 2-3 AKI incidence at 8.7% (95%CI: 0.4-17%). None of the patients developed severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy. Patients with prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, those requiring intensive care unit level care and with grade 3-4 CRS had a higher incidence of AKI. Most patients recovered with kidney function returning to baseline within 30 days. We conclude that with early recognition and management of CAR-T complications, the incidence of AKI is low, the severity of injury is mild, and most patients recover kidney function within 30 days.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>stem cell transplants treat acute kidney injury</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32734187"><Journal>Kidney medicine</Journal><Year/><Title>Crystalglobulin-Induced Nephropathy and Keratopathy.</Title><Abstract>Crystalglobulinemia, a rare manifestation of monoclonal gammopathy, results from vascular deposition of crystallized monoclonal proteins leading to tissue injury.

Sister chromatid identity is achieved through cohesin complexes (Smc1, Smc3, and Mcd1 and Irr1/Scc3), but the structure through which cohesins perform this task remains enigmatic. In the absence of unambiguous data, a popular model is that a subset of cohesin subunits form a huge ring-like structure that embraces both sister chromatids. This 'one-ring two-sister chromatid embrace' model makes clear predictions--including that premature cohesion loss in mitotic cells must occur through a substantial reduction in cohesin-DNA associations. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to directly test for cohesin dissociation from well-established cohesin binding sites in mitotic cells inactivated for Pds5--a key cohesin regulatory protein. The results reveal little if any chromatin dissociation from cohesins, despite a regimen that produces both massive loss of sister chromatid tethering and cell inviability. We further excluded models that cohesion loss in mitotic cells inactivated for Pds5 arises through either cohesin subunit degradation, premature Hos1-dependent Smc3 de-acetylation or Rad61/WAPL-dependent regulation of cohesin dynamics. In combination, our findings support a model that cohesin complexes associate with each sister and that sister chromatid cohesion likely results from cohesin-cohesin interactions. We further assessed the role that Pds5 plays in cohesion establishment during S-phase. The results show that Pds5 inactivation can result in establishment defects despite normal cohesion loading and Smc3 acetylation, revealing a novel establishment role for Pds5 that is independent of these processes. The combination of findings provides important new insights that significantly impact current models of both cohesion establishment reactions and maintenance.</Abstract><MeSH>Acetylation</MeSH><MeSH>Alleles</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Cycle Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Survival</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Mitosis</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Transport</MeSH><MeSH>S Phase</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

The molecular nature of this cascade is just beginning to emerge. Here we report the isolation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a functional analog of mammalian MAP kinases, designated MPK1 (for MAP kinase). The MPK1 gene was isolated as a dosage-dependent suppressor of the cell lysis defect associated with deletion of the BCK1 gene. The BCK1 gene is also predicted to encode a protein kinase which has been proposed to function downstream of the protein kinase C isozyme encoded by PKC1. The MPK1 gene possesses a 1.5-kb uninterrupted open reading frame predicted to encode a 53-kDa protein. The predicted Mpk1 protein (Mpk1p) shares 48 to 50% sequence identity with Xenopus MAP kinase and with the yeast mating pheromone response pathway components, Fus3p and Kss1p. Deletion of MPK1 resulted in a temperature-dependent cell lysis defect that was virtually indistinguishable from that resulting from deletion of BCK1, suggesting that the protein kinases encoded by these genes function in a common pathway. Expression of Xenopus MAP kinase suppressed the defect associated with loss of MPK1 but not the mating-related defects associated with loss of FUS3 or KSS1, indicating functional conservation between the former two protein kinases. Mutation of the presumptive phosphorylated tyrosine and threonine residues of Mpk1p individually to phenylalanine and alanine, respectively, severely impaired Mpk1p function. Additional epistasis experiments, and the overall architectural similarity between the PKC1-mediated pathway and the pheromone response pathway, suggest that Pkc1p regulates a protein kinase cascade in which Bck1p activates a pair of protein kinases, designated Mkk1p and Mkk2p (for MAP kinase-kinase), which in turn activate Mpk1p.</Abstract><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomes, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Deletion</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Genotype</MeSH><MeSH>Isoenzymes</MeSH><MeSH>Mammals</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Mutagenesis, Site-Directed</MeSH><MeSH>Oligodeoxyribonucleotides</MeSH><MeSH>Open Reading Frames</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinase C</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Restriction Mapping</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Suppression, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Xenopus</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function protein kinase</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31287657"><Journal>ACS chemical biology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Selective Proteolysis to Study the Global Conformation and Regulatory Mechanisms of c-Src Kinase.</Title><Abstract>Protein kinase pathways are traditionally mapped by monitoring downstream phosphorylation.

Our methodology can be expanded to monitor the global conformation of other tyrosine kinases, including c-Abl, and represents an important tool toward the elucidation of the noncatalytic functions of protein kinases.</Abstract><MeSH>CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Point Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Conformation</MeSH><MeSH>Proteolysis</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

The design of the vaccine is based on the well-documented ability of cholera antitoxin to neutralize both cholera and heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins (CT and LT, respectively) and on the ability of killed E. coli to enhance the immune response to cholera toxoid and, possibly, to conventional cholera vaccine as well. Evidence presented shows that a parenterally administered E. coli vaccine, prepared from an LT-only enterotoxigenic strain, reproducibly elevated rabbit antitoxin responses to cholera toxoid and that such responses correlated with dramatic protection against live cholera vibrios and the homologous E. coli strain in the rabbit ligated loop model of diarrheal disease. The results show also that cholera vaccine acted to suppress the rabbits' immune response to the cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine formula, even though all three antigens combined still provided significant protection against live organism challenge. On the basis of data presently available, the vaccine formula would be composed simply of cholera toxoid and E. coli vaccine, but may also include cholera vaccine. Since it has already been established that cholera toxoid and cholera vaccine are each safe for human use, additional vaccine development would require investigation of the safety of E. coli vaccine, alone and in combination with the other components.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antitoxins</MeSH><MeSH>Bacterial Toxins</MeSH><MeSH>Bacterial Vaccines</MeSH><MeSH>Cholera</MeSH><MeSH>Cholera Toxin</MeSH><MeSH>Cholera Vaccines</MeSH><MeSH>Diarrhea</MeSH><MeSH>Enterotoxins</MeSH><MeSH>Escherichia coli</MeSH><MeSH>Escherichia coli Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Escherichia coli Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Rabbits</MeSH><MeSH>Vaccination</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cholera vaccine US</QueryUsed><Result PMID="3434048"><Journal>Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii i immunobiologii</Journal><Year>1987</Year><Title>[Systemic immunity of experimental animals immunized with cholera vaccines].</Title><Abstract>The levels of antitoxic and vibriocidal antibodies in the sera of suckling rabbits after their parenteral immunization with cholera vaccine, cholera toxoid and a combination of cholera vaccine and toxoid were examined.

Five monoclonal antibodies that antagonized PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and marketed as immunotherapy for cancer treatment. However, some weaknesses of antibodies, such as high cost, low stability, poor amenability for oral administration, and immunogenicity, should not be overlooked. To overcome these disadvantages, small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-L1 were developed. In the present work, we applied in silico and in vitro approaches to develop short peptides targeting PD-1 as chemical probes for the inhibition of PD-1-PD-L1 interaction. We first predicted the potential binding pocket on PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interface (PPI). Sequentially, we carried out virtual screening against our in-house peptide library to identify potential ligands. WANG-003, WANG-004, and WANG-005, three of our in-house peptides, were predicted to bind to PD-1 with promising docking scores. Next, we conducted molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the further analysis of interactions between our peptides and PD-1. Finally, we evaluated the affinity between peptides and PD-1 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding technology. The present study provides a new perspective for the development of PD-1 inhibitors that disrupt PD-1-PD-L1 interactions. These promising peptides have the potential to be utilized as a novel chemical probe for further studies, as well as providing a foundation for further designs of potent small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1.</Abstract><MeSH>Computer Simulation</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Conformation</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Dynamics Simulation</MeSH><MeSH>Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor</MeSH><MeSH>Small Molecule Libraries</MeSH><MeSH>Surface Plasmon Resonance</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>PD-L1 inhibitors market</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32185707"><Journal>Advances in experimental medicine and biology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Discovery of New Immune Checkpoints: Family Grows Up.</Title><Abstract>The first generation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 has achieved profound and great success.

Located at nucleotides (nt) 1646 to 1741, it can stimulate the surface and X promoters from a downstream position. Moreover, the same sequence can also function as upstream regulatory element that activates the core promoter in a position- and orientation-dependent manner. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a negative regulatory element (NRE) upstream of enhancer II (nt 1613 to 1636) which can repress both the enhancer and upstream stimulatory function of the enhancer II sequence in differentiated liver cells. This NRE has marginal inhibitory effect by itself but a strong repressive function in the presence of a functional enhancer II. Mutational analysis reveals that sequence from nt 1616 to 1621 is required for repression of enhancer activity by the NRE. Gel shift analysis reveals that this negative regulatory region can be recognized by a specific protein factor(s) present at the 0.4 M NaCl fraction of HepG2 nuclear extracts. The discovery of the NRE indicates that HBV gene transcription is controlled by combined effects of both positive and negative regulation. It also provides a unique system with which to study the mechanism of negative regulation of gene expression.</Abstract><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Mutational Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>DNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Enhancer Elements, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Genome, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Hepatitis B Surface Antigens</MeSH><MeSH>Hepatitis B virus</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Liver</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Structure-Activity Relationship</MeSH><MeSH>Trans-Activators</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Cells, Cultured</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>negative enhancers</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31810403"><Journal>Journal of sports sciences</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Basic values predict doping likelihood.</Title><Abstract>Basic values, defined as trans-situational goals that vary in importance and act as guiding principles in life, have been linked with unethical cognitions, emotions and actions. Their roles in doping, a form of cheating in sport, have yet to established. College athletes reported doping likelihood in hypothetical scenario-based situations and completed measures of basic values, moral disengagement, and anticipated guilt. Correlation analysis showed that doping likelihood was positively associated with self-enhancement values but negatively associated with self-transcendence values and conservation values. Moral disengagement correlated positively with self-enhancement values and negatively with self-transcendence values, whereas guilt correlated positively conservation values and negatively with self-enhancement values and openness to change values. Regression analyses showed that self-enhancement values positively predicted doping likelihood directly, self-transcendence values negatively predicted doping likelihood indirectly via moral disengagement and guilt, and conservation values negatively predicted doping likelihood indirectly via guilt. In line with theory and evidence concerning the relationship between basic value systems and moral thought and action, we found that the values of athletes are directly (self-enhancement) and indirectly (self-transcendence, conservation) linked with likely use of banned performance enhancing substances, an expression of cheating in sport.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

This tripartite ring-shaped molecule is involved in holding replicated sister chromatids together from S phase until anaphase onset. Establishment of stable cohesion involves acetylation of the Smc3 component of cohesin during replication by the Eco1 acetyltransferase. This has been proposed to antagonise the activity of another member of the cohesin complex, Wpl1. Here, we describe the X-ray structure of the conserved Wapl domain, and demonstrate that it binds the ATPase head of the Smc3 protein. We present data that suggest that Wpl1 may be involved in regulating the ATPase activity of cohesin, and that this may be subject to the acetylation state of Smc3. In addition, we present a structure of the Wapl domain bound to a functionally relevant segment of the Smc3 ATPase.</Abstract><MeSH>Acetylation</MeSH><MeSH>Adenosine Triphosphatases</MeSH><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Ascomycota</MeSH><MeSH>Binding Sites</MeSH><MeSH>Carrier Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Catalytic Domain</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Cycle Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone</MeSH><MeSH>Crystallography, X-Ray</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Replication</MeSH><MeSH>Fluorescence Polarization</MeSH><MeSH>Fungal Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Peptide Fragments</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Array Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Structure, Tertiary</MeSH><MeSH>Proto-Oncogene Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function WAPL protein cohesin</QueryUsed><Result PMID="27872142"><Journal>The EMBO journal</Journal><Year>2016</Year><Title>Cohesin acetylation and Wapl-Pds5 oppositely regulate translocation of cohesin along DNA.</Title><Abstract>Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. The dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin is essential for these functions. However, the exact nature of cohesin dynamics, particularly cohesin translocation, remains unclear. We evaluated the dynamics of individual cohesin molecules on DNA and found that the cohesin core complex possesses an intrinsic ability to traverse DNA in an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent manner. Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin; this suppression is alleviated by the acetylation of cohesin and the action of mitotic kinases. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, cohesin is translocated on unreplicated DNA in an ATPase- and Smc3 acetylation-dependent manner. Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts.</Abstract><MeSH>Acetylation</MeSH><MeSH>Adenosine Triphosphate</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Cycle Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone</MeSH><MeSH>DNA</MeSH><MeSH>Movement</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Processing, Post-Translational</MeSH><MeSH>Xenopus Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Xenopus laevis</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Essential trace elements are in humans the chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), fluorine (F), iodine (I), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and questionably the boron (B) and vanadium (V). According to the biopsychosocial concept, mental functions have biological underpinnings, therefore the impairment of certain neurochemical processes due to shortage of trace elements may have mental consequences. Scientific investigations indicate the putative role of trace element deficiency in psychiatric disorders such in depression (Zn, Cr, Se, Fe, Co, I), premenstrual dysphoria (Cr), schizophrenia (Zn, Se), cognitive deterioration/de-mentia (B, Zn, Fe, Mn, Co, V), mental retardation (I, Mo, Cu), binge-eating (Cr), autism (Zn, Mn, Cu, Co) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Fe). At the same time, the excess quantity (chronic exposure, genetic error) of certain trace elements (Cu, Mn, Co, Cr, Fe, V) can also lead to mental disturbances (depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia). Lithium (Li), being efficacious in the treatment of bipolar mood disorder, is not declared officially as a trace element. Due to nutrition (drinking water, food) the serum Li level is about a thousand times less than that used in therapy. However, Li level in the red cells is lower as the membrane sodium-Li countertransport results in a Li efflux. Nevertheless, the possibility that Li is a trace element has emerged as studies indicate its potential efficacy in such a low concentration, since certain geographic regions show an inverse correlation between the Li level of drinking water and the suicide rate in that area.</Abstract><MeSH>Cognition Disorders</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Iron</MeSH><MeSH>Trace Elements</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function CR elements B-cells</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30715550"><Journal>Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Constitutive Activation of NAD-Dependent Sirtuin 3 Plays an Important Role in Tumorigenesis of Chromium(VI)-Transformed Cells.</Title><Abstract>Chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] causes malignant cell transformation.

Here we investigated the influence of Shh on thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development. Components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway were expressed by TEC, and use of a Gli Binding Site-green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic reporter mouse demonstrated active Hh-dependent transcription in TEC in the foetal and adult thymus. Analysis of Shh-deficient foetal thymus organ cultures (FTOC) showed that Shh is required for normal TEC differentiation. Shh-deficient foetal thymus contained fewer TEC than wild type (WT), the proportion of medullary TEC was reduced relative to cortical TEC, and cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules was increased on both cortical and medullary TEC populations. In contrast, the Gli3-deficient thymus, which shows increased Hh-dependent transcription in thymic stroma, had increased numbers of TEC, but decreased cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on both cortical and medullary TEC. Neutralisation of endogenous Hh proteins in WT FTOC led to a reduction in TEC numbers, and in the proportion of mature Aire-expressing medullary TEC, but an increase in cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on medullary TEC. Likewise, conditional deletion of Shh from TEC in the adult thymus resulted in alterations in TEC differentiation and consequent changes in T cell development.

Here we investigated the influence of Shh on thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development. Components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway were expressed by TEC, and use of a Gli Binding Site-green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic reporter mouse demonstrated active Hh-dependent transcription in TEC in the foetal and adult thymus. Analysis of Shh-deficient foetal thymus organ cultures (FTOC) showed that Shh is required for normal TEC differentiation. Shh-deficient foetal thymus contained fewer TEC than wild type (WT), the proportion of medullary TEC was reduced relative to cortical TEC, and cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules was increased on both cortical and medullary TEC populations. In contrast, the Gli3-deficient thymus, which shows increased Hh-dependent transcription in thymic stroma, had increased numbers of TEC, but decreased cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on both cortical and medullary TEC. Neutralisation of endogenous Hh proteins in WT FTOC led to a reduction in TEC numbers, and in the proportion of mature Aire-expressing medullary TEC, but an increase in cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on medullary TEC. Likewise, conditional deletion of Shh from TEC in the adult thymus resulted in alterations in TEC differentiation and consequent changes in T cell development. TEC numbers, and the proportion of mature Aire-expressing medullary TEC were reduced, and cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on medullary TEC was increased.

Appropriate public health and control measures will require discovery of the zoonotic MERS coronavirus reservoirs. The relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal MERS virus cell entry. Cell entry begins with virus spike (S) protein binding to DPP4 receptors. We constructed chimeric DPP4 receptors that have the virus-binding domains of indigenous Middle Eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting S protein binding and virus entry. Human, camel, and horse receptors were potent and nearly equally effective MERS virus receptors, while goat and bat receptors were considerably less effective. These patterns reflected S protein affinities for the receptors. However, even the low-affinity receptors could hypersensitize cells to infection when an S-cleaving protease(s) was present, indicating that affinity thresholds for virus entry must be considered in the context of host-cell proteolytic environments. These findings suggest that virus receptors and S protein-cleaving proteases combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several Middle Eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting MERS-CoV to humans.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Animals, Domestic</MeSH><MeSH>Animals, Wild</MeSH><MeSH>Coronavirus</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Variation</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Peptide Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Proteolysis</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Recombinant Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus</MeSH><MeSH>Virus Attachment</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>animal host Coronavirus MERS</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30893947"><Journal>Viruses</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Host Determinants of MERS-CoV Transmission and Pathogenesis.</Title><Abstract>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes respiratory infection in humans, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia.

Targeting LSC is essential to developing a potential cure for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Here we investigated the effect of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling on AML stem/progenitor proportion and examined the combined effect of AhR agonist and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The AhR agonist, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), significantly decreased the LSC proportion and clonogenicity and increased differentiation markers in AML primary cells. Synergistic/additive effects of FICZ and gilteritinib, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor, were confirmed in AML cells with FLT3-ITD. We present evidence that combination of both agents inhibits FLT3 downstream molecules and degrades clonogenicity. Collectively, our results suggest that FICZ not only compels LSC differentiation, but also enhances the efficacy of gilteritinib when combined. Clinical application of this combined approach may pave a new therapeutic strategy for patients with FLT3 mutated AML.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

A chimera between Ty3 and a Neo(r)-marked Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was constructed. The C-terminal domain of M-MuLV integrase (IN) was replaced with the C-terminal domain of Ty3 IN. The chimeric retroviruses were expressed from an amphotrophic envelope packaging cell line. The virus generated was used to infect the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and cells in which integration had occurred were selected by G418 resistance. Three independently integrated viruses were rescued. In each case, the C-terminal Ty3 IN sequences were maintained and short direct repeats of the genomic DNA flanked the integration site. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA flanking the insertion did not identify a tRNA gene; therefore, these integration events did not have Ty3 position specificity. This study showed that IN sequences from the yeast retrovirus-like element Ty3 can substitute for M-MuLV IN sequences in the C-terminal domain and contribute to IN function in vivo. It is also one of the first in vivo demonstrations of activity of a retrovirus encoding an integrase chimera. Studies of chimeras between IN species with distinctive integration patterns should complement previous work by expanding our understanding of the roles of nonconserved domains.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Vectors</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Integrases</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Moloney murine leukemia virus</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Transfer</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Retroelements</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Analysis, DNA</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Cells, Cultured</MeSH><MeSH>Viral Proteins</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>yeast Ty3</QueryUsed><Result PMID="9094678"><Journal>Journal of virology</Journal><Year>1997</Year><Title>Retrovirus-like end processing of the tobacco Tnt1 retrotransposon linear intermediates of replication.</Title><Abstract>The tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 can transpose through an RNA intermediate in the heterologous host Arabidopsis thaliana.

We describe here an unusual translational frameshift event occurring between the GAG3 and POL3 genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast. A +1 frameshift occurs within the sequence GCG AGU U (shown as codons of GAG3), encoding alanine-valine (GCG A GUU). Unlike other programed translational frameshifts described, this event does not require tRNA slippage between cognate or near-cognate codons in the mRNA. Two features distal to the GCG codon stimulate frameshifting. The low availability of the tRNA specific for the "hungry" serine codon, AGU, induces a translational pause required for frameshifting. A sequence of 12 nt distal to the AGU codon (termed the Ty3 "context") also stimulates the event.</Abstract><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Codon</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Mutational Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Transposable Elements</MeSH><MeSH>Frameshift Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Molecular</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Biosynthesis</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Transfer</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

In this paper, several features of invasomes, including their structure, mechanism of penetration, applications, characterization, and potential advantages in dermal drug delivery, are highlighted. Overall, this review suggests that enhanced transdermal penetration of drugs using invasomes provides an appropriate opportunity for the development of lipid vesicular carriers.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Their mechanisms of action and the factors regulating their expression in cancers are poorly understood. Here we show that high expression of uc.339 correlates with lower survival in 210 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We provide evidence from cell lines and primary samples that TP53 directly regulates uc.339. We find that transcribed uc.339 is upregulated in archival NSCLC samples, functioning as a decoy RNA for miR-339-3p, -663b-3p, and -95-5p. As a result, Cyclin E2, a direct target of all these microRNAs is upregulated, promoting cancer growth and migration. Finally, we find that modulation of uc.339 affects microRNA expression. However, overexpression or downregulation of these microRNAs causes no&#160;significant variations in uc.339 levels, suggesting a type of interaction for uc.339 that we call "entrapping".

We studied host-pathogen interactions using native lung tissue and a model of well-differentiated cultures of primary human airway epithelia. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for both the SARS-CoV and the related human respiratory coronavirus NL63, was expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma. As assessed by immunofluorescence staining and membrane biotinylation, ACE2 protein was more abundantly expressed on the apical than the basolateral surface of polarized airway epithelia. Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of epithelia. Undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well-differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected. Expression of ACE2 in poorly differentiated epithelia facilitated SARS spike (S) protein-pseudotyped virus entry. Consistent with the expression pattern of ACE2, the entry of SARS-CoV or a lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein in differentiated epithelia was more efficient when applied to the apical surface. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated in polarized epithelia and preferentially exited via the apical surface. The results indicate that infection of human airway epithelia by SARS coronavirus correlates with the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression and localization. These findings have implications for understanding disease pathogenesis associated with SARS-CoV and NL63 infections.</Abstract><MeSH>Carboxypeptidases</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Differentiation</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line</MeSH><MeSH>Coronavirus Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Epithelial Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Virus</MeSH><MeSH>SARS Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>ACE2 expressed cell surfaces</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32691370"><Journal>Stem cell reviews and reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptor ACE2 Is Expressed on Very Small CD45</Title><Abstract>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role as a member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in regulating the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin (1-7) (Ang [1-7]).

To kill these cancer cells, we need a novel therapeutic approach other than EGFR inhibitors. If a molecule is specifically expressed on the cell surface of such EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells, it can be a therapeutic target. We found that a mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline derived from HCC827&#160;cells, an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to a greater extent than its parental cells. ACE2 was also expressed at least partially in most of the primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas examined, and the ACE2 expression level in the cancer cells was much higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells. In addition, we developed an anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed H8R64, that was internalized by ACE2-expressing cells. If an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, it could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.</Abstract><MeSH>Adenocarcinoma</MeSH><MeSH>Adenocarcinoma of Lung</MeSH><MeSH>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized</MeSH><MeSH>Antineoplastic Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Proliferation</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Survival</MeSH><MeSH>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeSH><MeSH>Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor</MeSH><MeSH>ErbB Receptors</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Lung Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Inbred BALB C</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Targeted Therapy</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms, Experimental</MeSH><MeSH>Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A</MeSH><MeSH>Structure-Activity Relationship</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

However, duration of treatment response varies, and most patients eventually experience disease progression despite treatment. Leuprorelin is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, a commonly used form of ADT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring disease progression and predicting treatment response and survival in PCa. However, time-dependent profile of tumor regression and growth in patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on ADT has never been fully characterized. In this analysis, nationwide medical claims database provided by Humana from 2007 to 2011 was used to construct a population-based disease progression model for patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on leuprorelin. Data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling utilizing Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization (MCPEM) method in NONMEM. Covariate selection was performed using a modified Wald's approximation method with backward elimination (WAM-BE) proposed by our group. 1113 PSA observations from 264 subjects with malignant PCa were used for model development. PSA kinetics were well described by the final covariate model. Model parameters were well estimated, but large between-patient variability was observed. Hemoglobin significantly affected proportion of drug-resistant cells in the original tumor, while baseline PSA and antiandrogen use significantly affected treatment effect on drug-sensitive PCa cells (Ds). Population estimate of Ds was 3.78 x 10-2 day-1. Population estimates of growth rates for drug-sensitive (Gs) and drug-resistant PCa cells (GR) were 1.96 x 10-3 and 6.54 x 10-4 day-1, corresponding to a PSA doubling time of 354 and 1060 days, respectively. Proportion of the original PCa cells inherently resistant to treatment was estimated to be 1.94%. Application of population-based disease progression model to clinical data allowed characterization of tumor resistant patterns and growth/regression rates that enhances our understanding of how PCa responds to ADT.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

The chi-squared automatic interaction detection algorithm was for AA prediction. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to compare the DT analysis with Alvarado, Eskelinen score, and adult appendicitis scores (AAS).The following factors were selected for AA prediction: rebound tenderness severity, migration, urinalysis, symptom duration, leukocytosis, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein levels. The DT comprised 11 final nodes with the following AA probabilities: node 1, 100% (16/16); node 2, 90% (9/10); node 3, 80% (8/10); node 4, 60.9% (14/23); node 5, 50% (3/6); node 6, 43.8% (7/16); node 7, 22.6% (12/53); node 8, 13% (10/77); node 9, 5.6% (1/18); node 10, 0% (0/12); and node 11, 0% (0/3). The AUC of the DT was higher (0.850 [95% confidence interval {CI}; 0.799-0.893]) than the Alvarado score (0.695 [95% CI; 0.633-0.752]), AAS (0.749 [95% CI; 0.690-0.802]), and the Eskelinen score (0.715 [95% CI; 0.654-0.770]).

METHODS: Retrospective review of the literature using Medline and Lilacs databases, as well as the necropsy report. CLINICAL REPORT: A white male preterm infant born at 34 weeks of gestation weighing 1,750g to a primiparous mother. The Apgar score was 4 and 8 at 1st and 5th minutes, respectively. The physical exam was normal until the 9th day of life when the child developed clinical features suggestive of acute abdomen, possibly due to necrotizing enterocolitis with perforation. He was submitted to exploratory laparotomy, which leaded to the diagnostic of acute appendicitis. CONCLUSION: Acute appendicitis must be discarded on the differential diagnostic when there is a suspicion of necrotizing enterocolitis with perforation, and risk factors are not present.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>factors APPEND score</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32538771"><Journal>Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Evaluation of some cellular biomarker proteins, oxidative stress and clinical indices as results of laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children.</Title><Abstract>Laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children has the advantages of quick recovery, little influence of inflammatory and oxidative stress and low infection rate. Altogether 115 children with perforated appendicitis treated in our hospital from June 2018 to August 2019 were selected and divided into two groups according to different treatment methods. Laparoscopic appendectomy was used as the research group (RG) (67 cases) and open appendectomy (48 cases) as the control group (CG). The clinical indexes (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, ambulation time, incision length, postoperative exhaust time and length of stay) of the two groups were observed. The levels of C- reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin -6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) before and after treatment were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of oxidative stress factors (superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA)) and the incidence of postoperative incision infection were observed in the two groups. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate the postoperative pain in children. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of postoperative incision infection in children. The improvement degree of clinical indicators in RG was significantly better than that in CG. The expression levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; in RG were significantly lower than those in CG. The expression levels of SOD and MDA in RG were significantly better than those in CG. The postoperative incision infection rate in RG was significantly lower than that in CG. The postoperative VAS score in RG was significantly lower than that in CG. Logistic regression analysis results showed that the risk of incision infection was increased in children with operation time over 1h, incision length &amp;gt;3cm, high CRP, high PCT, high IL-6, high TNF-&#945;, high SOD and low MDA. Laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children can effectively reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, postoperative pain, and the damage to the body of children, and can also reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in children.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Targeting oncogenic fusion proteins presents an attractive therapeutic opportunity. However, SS18-SSX has proven intractable for therapeutic intervention. Using a domain-focused CRISPR screen we identified the bromodomain of BRD9 as a critical functional dependency in synovial sarcoma. BRD9 is a component of SS18-SSX containing BAF complexes in synovial sarcoma cells; and integration of BRD9 into these complexes is critical for cell growth. Moreover BRD9 and SS18-SSX co-localize extensively on the synovial sarcoma genome. Remarkably, synovial sarcoma cells are highly sensitive to a novel small molecule degrader of BRD9, while other sarcoma subtypes are unaffected. Degradation of BRD9 induces downregulation of oncogenic transcriptional programs and inhibits tumour progression in vivo. We demonstrate that BRD9 supports oncogenic mechanisms underlying the SS18-SSX fusion in synovial sarcoma and highlight targeted degradation of BRD9 as a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.</Abstract><MeSH>Disease Progression</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeSH><MeSH>HEK293 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Domains</MeSH><MeSH>Proteolysis</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Sarcoma, Synovial</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription, Genetic</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function SSX proteins</QueryUsed><Result PMID="12007189"><Journal>Genes, chromosomes &amp; cancer</Journal><Year>2002</Year><Title>The cancer-related protein SSX2 interacts with the human homologue of a Ras-like GTPase interactor, RAB3IP, and a novel nuclear protein, SSX2IP.</Title><Abstract>The SSX gene family is composed of at least five functional and highly homologous members, SSX1 to SSX5, that are normally expressed in only the testis and thyroid. SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 may be fused to the SYT gene as a result of the t(X;18) translocation in synovial sarcoma. In addition, the SSX1, SSX2, SSX4, and SSX5 genes were found to be aberrantly expressed in several other malignancies, including melanoma. The SSX proteins are localized in the nucleus and are diffusely distributed. In addition, they may be included in polycomb-group nuclear bodies. Other studies have indicated that the SSX proteins may act as transcriptional repressors. As a first step toward the elucidation of the cellular signaling networks in which the SSX proteins may act, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify SSX2-interacting proteins. By doing so, two novel human proteins were detected: RAB3IP, the human homolog of an interactor of the Ras-like GTPase Rab3A; and a novel protein, SSX2IP. RAB3IP did not interact with either SSX1, SSX3, or SSX4 in the yeast two-hybrid system, whereas SSX2IP interacted with SSX3 but not with either SSX1 or SSX4. Further analysis of deletion mutants showed that both RAB3IP and SSX2IP interact with the N-terminal moiety of the SSX2 protein. Immunofluorescence analyses of transfected cells revealed that the RAB3IP protein is normally localized in the cytoplasm. However, coexpression of both RAB3IP and SSX2 led to colocalization of both proteins in the nucleus. Likewise, the SSX2IP protein was found to be colocalizing with SSX2 in the nucleus. By performing glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays, we found that both RAB3IP and SSX2IP interact directly with SSX2 in vitro. These newly observed protein/protein interactions may have important implications for the mechanisms underlying normal and malignant cellular growth.</Abstract><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Carrier Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosome Mapping</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1</MeSH><MeSH>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12</MeSH><MeSH>Fetus</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Library</MeSH><MeSH>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</MeSH><MeSH>HeLa Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasm Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Peptides</MeSH><MeSH>Repressor Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</MeSH><MeSH>Testis</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Cells, Cultured</MeSH><MeSH>Two-Hybrid System Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>rab3A GTP-Binding Protein</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function SSX proteins</QueryUsed><Result PMID="20981248"><Journal>Clinical &amp; developmental immunology</Journal><Year>2010</Year><Title>The SSX family of cancer-testis antigens as target proteins for tumor therapy.</Title><Abstract>Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) represent an expanding class of tumor-associated proteins defined on the basis of their tissue-restricted expression to testis or ovary germline cells and frequent ectopic expression in tumor tissue. The expression of CTA in MHC class I-deficient germline cells makes these proteins particularly attractive as immunotherapeutic targets because they serve as essentially tumor-specific antigens for MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells. Moreover, because CTAs are expressed in many types of cancer, any therapeutic developed to target these antigens might have efficacy for multiple cancer types. Of particular interest among CTAs is the synovial sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint (SSX) family of proteins, which includes ten highly homologous family members. Expression of SSX proteins in tumor tissues has been associated with advanced stages of disease and worse patient prognosis. Additionally, both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to SSX proteins have been demonstrated in patients with tumors of varying histological origin, which indicates that natural immune responses can be spontaneously generated to these antigens in cancer patients. The current review will describe the history and identification of this family of proteins, as well as what is known of their function, expression in normal and malignant tissues, and immunogenicity.</Abstract><MeSH>Antigens, Neoplasm</MeSH><MeSH>CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Cancer Vaccines</MeSH><MeSH>Cytotoxicity, Immunologic</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasm Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Prognosis</MeSH><MeSH>Repressor Proteins</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function SSX proteins</QueryUsed><Result PMID="14603256"><Journal>Oncogene</Journal><Year>2003</Year><Title>Conserved SNH domain of the proto-oncoprotein SYT interacts with components of the human chromatin remodelling complexes, while the QPGY repeat domain forms homo-oligomers.</Title><Abstract>Many studies have now established that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes are involved in activation and repression of a variety of genes. In mammalian cells, these complexes contain the BRM and BRG1 helicase-like proteins that are thought to be responsible for nucleosome remodelling. The proto-oncoprotein SYT, involved in the unique translocation t(X;18) found in synovial sarcoma, is known to interact with human BRM (hBRM), thus providing a link between chromatin remodelling factors and human cancer. In this work, we address how SYT interacts with hBRM and BRG1. We demonstrate that the conserved N-terminal SNH domain of SYT, which is also present in the oncoproteins SYT-SSX, binds to both hBRM and BRG1. We have also found that in vivo the C-terminus transactivation QPGY region of SYT can interact with itself. This results in an amplified interaction with hBRM and highlights a possible regulatory function of this domain in cells.</Abstract><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>COS Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Conserved Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Neurotensin</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Structure, Tertiary</MeSH><MeSH>Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Proto-Oncogene Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Repressor Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>function SSX proteins</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31695025"><Journal>Cell death &amp; disease</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>A functional genetic screen identifies the Mediator complex as essential for SSX2-induced senescence.</Title><Abstract>The senescence response to oncogenes is believed to be a barrier to oncogenic transformation in premalignant lesions, and describing the mechanisms by which tumor cells evade this response is important for early diagnosis and treatment. The male germ cell-associated protein SSX2 is ectopically expressed in many types of cancer and is functionally involved in regulating chromatin structure and supporting cell proliferation. Similar to many well-characterized oncogenes, SSX2 has the ability to induce senescence in cells. In this study, we performed a functional genetic screen to identify proteins implicated in SSX2-induced senescence and identified several subunits of the Mediator complex, which is central in regulating RNA polymerase-mediated transcription. Further experiments showed that reduced levels of MED1, MED4, and MED14 perturbed the development of senescence in SSX2-expressing cells. In contrast, knockdown of MED1 did not prevent development of B-Raf- and Epirubicin-induced senescence, suggesting that Mediator may be specifically linked to the cellular functions of SSX2 that may lead to development of senescence or be central in a SSX2-specific senescence response. Indeed, immunostaining of melanoma tumors, which often express SSX proteins, exhibited altered levels of MED1 compared to benign nevi. Similarly, RNA-seq analysis suggested that MED1, MED4, and MED14 were downregulated in some tumors, while upregulated in others. In conclusion, our study reveals the Mediator complex as essential for SSX2-induced senescence and suggests that changes in Mediator activity could be instrumental for tumorigenesis.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

A large-scale multicenter design has been required in most cases. Over the last few years, several biologics have been evaluated as treatments for lupus nephritis or for the skin and joint manifestations of SLE. The central role for the B-cell in SLE, together with improved knowledge of the targets on the B-cell surface, has prompted efforts to develop monoclonal antibodies as treatments for SLE. The two available monoclonal antibodies are rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) and belimumab (anti-BlyS antibody). The results obtained with belimumab were used to develop a new measurement tool, the SLE Responder Index (SRI), and prompted an application for a license to use belimumab in SLE. Other targets identified on the B-cell surface are being evaluated.</Abstract><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived</MeSH><MeSH>B-Lymphocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Membrane</MeSH><MeSH>Cytokines</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic</MeSH><MeSH>Rituximab</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>target belimumab Systemic treatment</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32695790"><Journal>Frontiers in medicine</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Belimumab and Rituximab in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Tale of Two B Cell-Targeting Agents.</Title><Abstract>Given the centrality of B cells to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it stands to reason that a candidate therapeutic agent that targets B cells could be efficacious. Both rituximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD20 on the surface of B cells, and belimumab, a mAb that binds and neutralizes the B cell survival factor BAFF, have been extensively studied for the treatment of SLE. Despite the greater ability of rituximab to deplete B cells than that of belimumab, randomized controlled trials of rituximab in SLE failed to reach their primary clinical endpoints, whereas the primary clinical endpoints were reached in four independent phase-III clinical trials of belimumab in SLE. Accordingly, belimumab has been approved for treatment of SLE, whereas use of rituximab in SLE remains off-label. Nevertheless, several case series of rituximab have pointed to some utility for rituximab in treating SLE. In this review, we provide a concise summary of the factors that led to belimumab's success in SLE as well an analysis of the elements that may have contributed to the lack of success seen in the rituximab randomized controlled trials in SLE.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>target belimumab Systemic treatment</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32695790"><Journal>Frontiers in medicine</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Belimumab and Rituximab in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Tale of Two B Cell-Targeting Agents.</Title><Abstract>Given the centrality of B cells to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it stands to reason that a candidate therapeutic agent that targets B cells could be efficacious.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several significant loci associated with schizophrenia. However, the explained heritability is still low. Growing evidence has shown schizophrenia is attributable to multiple genes with moderate effects. In-depth mining and integration of GWAS data is urgently expected to uncover disease-related gene combination patterns. Network-based analysis is a promising strategy to better interpret GWAS to identify disease-related network modules. We performed a network-based analysis on three independent schizophrenia GWASs by using a refined analysis framework, which included a more accurate gene P-value calculation, dynamic network module searching algorithm and detailed functional analysis for the obtained modules genes. The result generated 79 modules including 238 genes, which form a highly connected subnetwork with more statistical significance than expected by chance. The result validated several reported disease genes, such as MAD1L1, MCC, SDCCAG8, VAT1L, MAPK14, MYH9 and FXYD6, and also obtained several novel candidate genes and gene-gene interactions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the module genes suggested they were enriched in several neural and immune system related pathways/GO terms, such as neurotrophin signaling pathway, synaptosome, regulation of protein ubiquitination, and antigen processing and presentation. Further crosstalk analysis revealed these pathways/GO terms were cooperated with each other, and identified several important genes, which might play vital roles to connect these functions. Our network-based analysis of schizophrenia GWASs will facilitate the understanding of genetic mechanisms of schizophrenia. </Abstract><MeSH>Databases, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Regulatory Networks</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Loci</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Genome-Wide Association Study</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Schizophrenia</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Treat of HER2 positive breast cancers has been greatly promoted in last few years, but the accompany HER2 blockade has hindered the therapeutic effect. Pyrotinib is a pan-HER kinase inhibitor that suppresses signaling through the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that inhibits cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation in ER+&#160;breast cancers. We hypothesized that the combination of pan-HER kinase inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors would show synergistic antitumor activity in vivo in vitro. Our data show that a combination of palbociclib and pyrotinib was highly synergistic in inhibiting cancer proliferation and colony formation. The combined treatment also induced significant decreases in pAKT and pHER3 activation, induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest, and increased rates of apoptosis. In the xenograft model, the combination treatment demonstrated greater antitumor activity than either agent alone, with no apparent increase in toxicity.

Th2 cytokines are involved in the protective immune response against foreign pathogens, such as parasites. However, excessive production of Th2 cytokines results in type-2 allergic inflammation. Therefore, the application of a GATA3 inhibitor provides a new therapeutic strategy to regulate Th2 cytokine production. Here, we established a novel high-throughput screening system for an inhibitor of a DNA-binding protein, such as a transcription factor, and identified pyrrothiogatain as a novel inhibitor of GATA3 DNA-binding activity. Pyrrothiogatain inhibited the DNA-binding activity of GATA3 and other members of the GATA family. Pyrrothiogatain also inhibited the interaction between GATA3 and SOX4, suggesting that it interacts with the DNA-binding region of GATA3. Furthermore, pyrrothiogatain significantly suppressed Th2 cell differentiation, without impairing Th1 cell differentiation, and inhibited the expression and production of Th2 cytokines. Our results suggest that pyrrothiogatain regulates the differentiation and function of Th2 cells via inhibition of GATA3 DNA binding activity, which demonstrates the efficiency of our drug screening system for the development of novel small compounds that inhibit the DNA-binding activity of transcription factors.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>Gata3 Th2 cells</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32399548"><Journal>The Journal of experimental medicine</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Blimp-1 is essential for allergen-induced asthma and Th2 cell development in the lung.</Title><Abstract>A Th2 immune response is central to allergic airway inflammation, which afflicts millions worldwide. However, the mechanisms that augment GATA3 expression in an antigen-primed developing Th2 cell are not well understood. Here, we describe an unexpected role for Blimp-1, a transcriptional repressor that constrains autoimmunity, as an upstream promoter of GATA3 expression that is critical for Th2 cell development in the lung to inhaled but not systemically delivered allergens but is dispensable for TFH function and IgE production. Mechanistically, Blimp-1 acts through Bcl6, leading to increased GATA3 expression in lung Th2 cells. Surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-21, is required via STAT3 activation to up-regulate Blimp-1 and promote Th2 cell development. These data reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for an IL-10-STAT3-Blimp-1 circuit as an initiator of an inflammatory Th2 response in the lung to allergens. Thus, Blimp-1 in a context-dependent fashion can drive inflammation by promoting rather than terminating effector T cell responses.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules "connected" in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, B-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. B-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathway's downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as B-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways with statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset. STRING interactions whose proteins are B-connected in Reactome have statistically significantly higher scores than interactions connected in the bipartite graph representation.

Imprinted lncRNAs target and recruit epigenetic silencing factors to a cluster of imprinted genes on the same chromosome, making them one of the best characterized lncRNAs for silencing distant genes in cis. In this study we examined silencing of the distant imprinted gene Slc22a3 by the lncRNA Airn in the Igf2r imprinted cluster in mouse. Previously we proposed that imprinted lncRNAs may silence distant imprinted genes by disrupting promoter-enhancer interactions by being transcribed through the enhancer, which we called the enhancer interference hypothesis. Here we tested this hypothesis by first using allele-specific chromosome conformation capture (3C) to detect interactions between the Slc22a3 promoter and the locus of the Airn lncRNA that silences it on the paternal chromosome. In agreement with the model, we found interactions enriched on the maternal allele across the entire Airn gene consistent with multiple enhancer-promoter interactions. Therefore, to test the enhancer interference hypothesis we devised an approach to delete the entire Airn gene. However, the deletion showed that there are no essential enhancers for Slc22a2, Pde10a and Slc22a3 within the Airn gene, strongly indicating that the Airn RNA rather than its transcription is responsible for silencing distant imprinted genes. Furthermore, we found that silent imprinted genes were covered with large blocks of H3K27me3 on the repressed paternal allele. Therefore we propose an alternative hypothesis whereby the chromosome interactions may initially guide the lncRNA to target imprinted promoters and recruit repressive chromatin, and that these interactions are lost once silencing is established.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Enhancer Elements, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Silencing</MeSH><MeSH>Genomic Imprinting</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Organic Cation Transport Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Organic Cation Transporter 2</MeSH><MeSH>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Promoter Regions, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Long Noncoding</MeSH><MeSH>Receptor, IGF Type 2</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Deletion</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Slc22a3 imprinted</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31329595"><Journal>PLoS genetics</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>The Airn lncRNA does not require any DNA elements within its locus to silence distant imprinted genes.</Title><Abstract>Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are numerous and found throughout the mammalian genome, and many are thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression.

Knowledge of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has become a principle interest of many groups within the field of proteomics. At the confluence of technologies, such as cross-linking mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid, protein cofractionation, and affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), detection of PPIs can uncover novel biological inferences at a high-throughput. Thus new platforms to provide community access to large data sets are necessary. To this end, we have developed a web application that enables exploration and dissemination of the growing BioPlex interaction network. BioPlex is a large-scale interactome data set based on AP-MS of baits from the human ORFeome. The latest BioPlex data set release (BioPlex 2.0) contains 56&#8239;553 interactions from 5891 AP-MS experiments. To improve community access to this vast compendium of interactions, we developed BioPlex Display, which integrates individual protein querying, access to empirical data, and on-the-fly annotation of networks within an easy-to-use and mobile web application. BioPlex Display enables rapid acquisition of data from BioPlex and development of hypotheses based on protein interactions.</Abstract><MeSH>Computational Biology</MeSH><MeSH>Databases, Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Mass Spectrometry</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Interaction Mapping</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Interaction Maps</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>BioPlex network</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32575886"><Journal>Genes</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Predicting Functions of Uncharacterized Human Proteins: From Canonical to Proteoforms.</Title><Abstract>Despite tremendous efforts in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics communities, there is still no comprehensive data about the exact number of protein-coding genes, translated proteoforms, and their function.

These can present with overlapping clinical phenotypes, making molecular diagnosis challenging. Single-gene or small-panel PCR-based methods can help to identify the precise genetic cause, but they can be slow and costly and often yield no result. Researchers are increasingly performing genomic analysis via whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES and WGS) to diagnose genetic disorders. However, until recently, analysis protocols could not identify repeat expansions in these datasets. We developed exSTRa (expanded short tandem repeat algorithm), a method that uses either WES or WGS to identify repeat expansions. Performance of exSTRa was assessed in a simulation study. In addition, four retrospective cohorts of individuals with eleven different known repeat-expansion disorders were analyzed with exSTRa. We assessed results by comparing the findings to known disease status. Performance was also compared to three other analysis methods (ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and TREDPARSE), which were developed specifically for WGS data. Expansions in the assessed STR loci were successfully identified in WES and WGS datasets by all four methods with high specificity and sensitivity. Overall, exSTRa demonstrated more robust and superior performance for WES data than did the other three methods. We demonstrate that exSTRa can be effectively utilized as a screening tool for detecting repeat expansions in WES and WGS data, although the best performance would be produced by consensus calling, wherein at least two out of the four currently available screening methods call an expansion.</Abstract><MeSH>Algorithms</MeSH><MeSH>Exome</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Diseases, Inborn</MeSH><MeSH>Genome, Human</MeSH><MeSH>Genomics</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Microsatellite Repeats</MeSH><MeSH>Retrospective Studies</MeSH><MeSH>Sensitivity and Specificity</MeSH><MeSH>Whole Genome Sequencing</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>algorithm detecting expansions tandem repeats</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31920494"><Journal>Frontiers in neuroscience</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>A Targeted Gene Panel That Covers Coding, Non-coding and Short Tandem Repeat Regions Improves the Diagnosis of Patients With Neurodegenerative Diseases.</Title><Abstract>Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations.

The possibility to genetically modify micro-organisms to bring immunogenic material (antigens/epitopes) to the human (or animal) immune system to provoke an immune response, provides new hope to producing prophylactic vaccines against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis and emerging diseases. Regulatory requirements associated with the development of genetically-modified organism (GMO)-containing vaccines in Europe add an additional burden to the clinical trial application procedure and to the preparation and initiation of a clinical trial of such vaccines. Moreover, the GMO regulatory framework is complex and only partially harmonised across Europe, which may hamper multi-country clinical trials with GMO-containing vaccines. This paper provides an overview of clinical trial applications with GMO-containing vaccines in Europe and reviews the regulatory framework in countries where GMO-containing vaccine clinical trial authorisation (CTA) applications were submitted between 2004 and 2017.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Despite the recent identification of the zinc finger protein PRDM9 and its 13-mer binding motif as major regulators for meiotic recombination hotspots, other regulators remain to be discovered. Existing methods for finding DNA sequence motifs of recombination hotspots often rely on the enrichment of co-localizations between hotspots and short DNA patterns, which ignore the cross-individual variation of recombination rates and sequence polymorphisms in the population.

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective properties.

Surface-expressed syndecan-1 undergoes proteolytic shedding leading to the release of the soluble N-terminal ectodomain from a transmembrane C-terminal fragment (tCTF). We show that the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 17 generates a syndecan-1 tCTF, which can then undergo further intra-membrane proteolysis by &#947;-secretase. Scratch-induced wound closure of cultured lung epithelial A549 tumor cells associates with increased syndecan-1 cleavage as evidenced by the release of shed syndecan-1 ectodomain and enhanced generation of the tCTF. Both wound closure and the associated syndecan-1 shedding can be suppressed by inhibition of ADAM family proteases. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion into matrigel as well as several signaling pathways implicated in these responses are suppressed by silencing of syndecan-1. These defects of syndecan-1 deficient cells can be overcome by overexpression of syndecan-1 tCTF or a corresponding tCTF of syndecan-4 but not by overexpression of a tCTF lacking the transmembrane domain. Finally, lung metastasis formation of A549 cells in SCID mice was found to be dependent on syndecan-1, and the presence of syndecan-1 tCTF was sufficient for this activity. Thus, the syndecan-1 tCTF by itself is capable of mediating critical syndecan-1-dependent functions in cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis formation and therefore can replace full length syndecan-1 in the situation of increased syndecan-1 shedding during cell migration and tumor formation. </Abstract><MeSH>ADAM Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>ADAM17 Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Blotting, Western</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Movement</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Primers</MeSH><MeSH>Epithelial Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Flow Cytometry</MeSH><MeSH>HEK293 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunoblotting</MeSH><MeSH>Lung</MeSH><MeSH>Lung Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, SCID</MeSH><MeSH>Polymerase Chain Reaction</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Statistics, Nonparametric</MeSH><MeSH>Syndecan-1</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>Syndecans</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30718543"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Contribution of syndecans to cellular internalization and fibrillation of amyloid-&#946;(1-42).</Title><Abstract>Intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-&#946;(1-42) (A&#946;1-42) is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In order to assess the possibility that normal cellular host defense is inadequate in protecting against C. neoformans var. gattii, we compared the two varieties of C. neoformans cells and their culture filtrate antigens (CneF) with respect to effects on neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN]) locomotion. In a 48-well modified Boyden chamber, the cells and CneF of C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype A and D) isolates stimulated chemotaxis and chemokinesis of human PMN and activated a complement component(s) in pooled human serum to become a chemoattractant(s) for human PMN. In contrast, the cells and CneF of C. neoformans var. gattii (serotype B and C) isolates did not stimulate chemotaxis or chemokinesis in human PMN but rather inhibited chemokinesis and chemotactic responses of PMN to pooled human serum and formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine. Neither of the CneF from the C. neoformans var. gattii isolates was cytotoxic to PMN. Furthermore, with the mouse model, we found that CneF from C. neoformans var. neoformans caused migration of PMN into gelatin sponges implanted in naive and immunized mice, whereas CneF from C. neoformans var. gattii inhibited PMN migration into sponges. Our results, combined with findings of others showing reduced PMN infiltration in lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans var. gattii compared with PMN infiltration in lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans var. neoformans, indicate that the relative inadequacy of normal host resistance mechanisms to prevent infection with C. neoformans var. gattii results, in part, from inhibition of PMN migration to the site of the organism.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Antigens, Fungal</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Survival</MeSH><MeSH>Chemotaxis, Leukocyte</MeSH><MeSH>Cryptococcus neoformans</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Hypersensitivity, Delayed</MeSH><MeSH>Immunity, Cellular</MeSH><MeSH>In Vitro Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Inbred CBA</MeSH><MeSH>N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine</MeSH><MeSH>Neutrophils</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>chemokinesis</QueryUsed><Result PMID="17080611"><Journal>Plant, cell &amp; environment</Journal><Year>2006</Year><Title>Acyl-homoserine lactones modulate the settlement rate of zoospores of the marine alga Ulva intestinalis via a novel chemokinetic mechanism.</Title><Abstract>Bacteria utilize quorum sensing to regulate the expression of cell density-dependant phenotypes such as biofilm formation and virulence.

STAT1 regulates a variety of cellular processes, such as antimicrobial activities, cell proliferation and cell death. It exerts important immune modulatory activities both in the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system. Based on studies in mice and data from human patients, STAT1 is generally considered a tumour suppressor but there is growing evidence that it can also act as a tumour promoter. This review aims at contrasting the two faces of STAT1 in tumourigenesis and providing an overview on the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms or pathways.</Abstract><MeSH>Adaptive Immunity</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunity, Innate</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>STAT1 Transcription Factor</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Suppressor Proteins</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process JAK/STAT</QueryUsed><Result PMID="22067483"><Journal>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</Journal><Year>2012</Year><Title>The ubiquitin hydrolase USP22 contributes to 3'-end processing of JAK-STAT-inducible genes.</Title><Abstract>The JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling pathway drives cellular growth, differentiation, and the immune response. STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. We previously showed that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (ubH2B) is highly dynamic at the STAT1 target gene, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), suggesting that a deubiquitinase is recruited during gene activation. Here, we report that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitin hydrolase, USP22, results in 2-fold higher ubH2B, and 2-fold lower transcriptional elongation at IRF1. We also demonstrate that USP22 depletion diminishes 3'-end cleavage/polyadenylation by 2- to 3-fold. Furthermore, the polyadenylation factor CPSF73 is not effectively recruited, and serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is also disrupted. The transcriptional and processing defects observed in the USP22-knockdown cells are reversed by transient USP22 overexpression. Together, these results suggest that ubH2B helps recruit polyadenylation factors to STAT1-activated genes. We propose a working model, wherein a cycle of H2B ubiquitination/deubiquitination specifies Ser2P to regulate elongation and 3'-end processing of JAK-STAT-inducible mRNAs. These results further elaborate USP22 function and its role as a putative cancer stem cell marker.</Abstract><MeSH>3' Untranslated Regions</MeSH><MeSH>Base Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Death</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line</MeSH><MeSH>Chromatin</MeSH><MeSH>Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Primers</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Knockdown Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Interferon Regulatory Factor-1</MeSH><MeSH>Janus Kinases</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Processing, Post-Translational</MeSH><MeSH>RNA 3' End Processing</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Polymerase II</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>STAT Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>Thiolester Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Ubiquitination</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>cellular process JAK/STAT</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32020553"><Journal>Drugs</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>JAK Inhibitors for Treatment of Psoriasis: Focus on Selective TYK2 Inhibitors.</Title><Abstract>Despite advances in the treatment of psoriasis, there is an unmet need for effective and safe oral treatments. The Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway plays a significant role in intracellular signalling of cytokines of numerous cellular processes, important in both normal and pathological states of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Particularly in psoriasis, where the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis is currently considered the crucial pathogenic pathway, blocking the JAK-STAT pathway with small molecules would be expected to be clinically effective. However, relative non-specificity and low therapeutic index of the available JAK inhibitors have delayed their integration into the therapeutic armamentarium of psoriasis. Current research appears to be focused on Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), the first described member of the JAK family. Data from the Phase II trial of BMS-986165-a selective TYK2 inhibitor-in psoriasis have been published and clinical results are encouraging, with a large Phase III programme ongoing. Further, the selective TYK2 inhibitor PF-06826647 is being tested in moderate-to-severe psoriasis in a Phase II clinical trial. Brepocitinib, a potent TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, is also being evaluated, as both oral and topical treatment. Results of studies with TYK2 inhibitors will be important in assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of these drugs and their place in the therapeutic armamentarium of psoriasis. This article reviews current data on the impact of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Approximately 36% of these are meningiomas, making it the most common primary brain tumor. Because meningioma risk increases dramatically with age, the healthcare burden of meningioma in the developed world will continue to rise as demographics shift toward an older population. In addition to demographic factors associated with increased meningioma risk (i.e., older age, female sex, African American ethnicity), increased body mass index is a strong risk factor. A history of atopic allergies, eczema, and increased serum IgE are all consistently associated with reduced meningioma risk, suggesting a potential role for immunosurveillance. Although ionizing radiation is a strong meningioma risk factor, it accounts for very few cases at the population level. Recent studies suggest that diagnostic radiation (e.g., dental X-rays) increases meningioma risk. Because radiation dosages associated with medical imaging have decreased dramatically, the public health impact of this exposure is likely in decline. Genome-wide association studies have identified common inherited variants in the gene MLLT10 and RIC8A as low-penetrance meningioma risk alleles. To provide further insight into the etiology of meningioma, future studies will need to simultaneously examine genetic and environmental risk factors, while also stratifying analyses by subject sex.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Here we demonstrate that CUL4A plays an oncogenic role in prostate cancer development and prostate cancer cells with higher level of CUL4A are particularly sensitive to thalidomide treatment. We show that CUL4A is frequently overexpressed in human primary prostate cancer and cell lines. Notably, subjects with tumors that highly expressed CUL4A had poor overall survival. CUL4A downregulation inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, whereas CUL4A overexpression transformed human normal prostate epithelial cells and promoted invasion, which was attenuated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. We further show that the sensitivity to thalidomide is positively correlated with CUL4A expression in a panel of prostate cell lines. Ectopic CUL4A expression greatly enhanced sensitivity to thalidomide, while its downregulation conferred resistance to this drug. Mechanistically, thalidomide decreased CUL4A in a time- and dose-dependent manner, consequently leading to inaction of ERK pathway. Finally, we show that cereblon level is correlated with CUL4A expression and downregulated in thalidomide-resistant prostate cancer cell. Our results offer the first evidence that CUL4A is a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer and may serve as a biomarker for assessing prognosis of human prostate cancer and response to thalidomide treatment.</Abstract><MeSH>Angiogenesis Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Apoptosis</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Survival</MeSH><MeSH>Cullin Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Knockdown Techniques</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Kaplan-Meier Estimate</MeSH><MeSH>MAP Kinase Signaling System</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mice, Nude</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasm Transplantation</MeSH><MeSH>Peptide Hydrolases</MeSH><MeSH>Prostatic Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Interference</MeSH><MeSH>Thalidomide</MeSH><MeSH>Tissue Array Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Tumor Burden</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>promote sensitivity treatment prostate cancer</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31966904"><Journal>International journal of clinical and experimental pathology</Journal><Year>2017</Year><Title>miR-181 regulation of BAX controls cisplatin sensitivity of prostate cancer cells.</Title><Abstract>Prostate cancer is one of the most common male malignancies and remains the second leading cause for cancer-specific mortalities in men.

Identification of clinically relevant genetic alterations leading to CRPC may reveal potential vulnerabilities for cancer therapy. Here we find that CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a transmembrane protein that acts as a substrate for SRC family kinases (SFKs), is overexpressed in a subset of CRPC. Notably, CDCP1 cooperates with the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN to promote the emergence of metastatic prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we find that androgens suppress CDCP1 expression and that androgen deprivation in combination with loss of PTEN promotes the upregulation of CDCP1 and the subsequent activation of the SRC/MAPK pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that anti-CDCP1 immunoliposomes (anti-CDCP1 ILs) loaded with chemotherapy suppress prostate cancer growth when administered in combination with enzalutamide. Thus, our study identifies CDCP1 as a powerful driver of prostate cancer progression and uncovers different potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metastatic prostate tumors.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate designed to enhance responses induced by BCG. Antigen-specific interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) production is greatly enhanced by MVA85A, however the variability between healthy individuals is extensive. In this study we have sought to characterize the early changes in gene expression in humans following vaccination with MVA85A and relate these to long-term immunogenicity. Two days post-vaccination, MVA85A induces a strong interferon and inflammatory response. Separating volunteers into high and low responders on the basis of T cell responses to 85A peptides measured during the trial, an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells is seen in low but not high responders. Additionally, high levels of Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 1 on day of vaccination are associated with an increased response to antigen 85A. In a classification model, combined expression levels of TLR1, TICAM2 and CD14 on day of vaccination and CTLA4 and IL2R&#945; two days post-vaccination can classify high and low responders with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, administering MVA85A in mice with anti-TLR2 antibodies may abrogate high responses, and neutralising antibodies to TLRs 1, 2 or 6 or HMGB1 decrease CXCL2 production during in vitro stimulation with MVA85A. HMGB1 is released into the supernatant following atimulation with MVA85A and we propose this signal may be the trigger activating the TLR pathway. This study suggests an important role for an endogenous ligand in innate sensing of MVA and demonstrates the importance of pattern recognition receptors and regulatory T cell responses in determining the magnitude of the antigen specific immune response to vaccination with MVA85A in humans. </Abstract><MeSH>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing</MeSH><MeSH>Adolescent</MeSH><MeSH>Adult</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cluster Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Profiling</MeSH><MeSH>Gene Expression Regulation</MeSH><MeSH>HMGB1 Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunity, Innate</MeSH><MeSH>Lipopolysaccharide Receptors</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Signal Transduction</MeSH><MeSH>T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory</MeSH><MeSH>Toll-Like Receptor 1</MeSH><MeSH>Toll-Like Receptor 2</MeSH><MeSH>Toll-Like Receptor 6</MeSH><MeSH>Toll-Like Receptors</MeSH><MeSH>Tuberculosis Vaccines</MeSH><MeSH>Vaccination</MeSH><MeSH>Young Adult</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>MVA85A</QueryUsed><Result PMID="26854906"><Journal>Vaccine</Journal><Year>2016</Year><Title>A first-in-human phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A-IMX313, administered to BCG-vaccinated adults.</Title><Abstract>There is an urgent need for a new and effective tuberculosis vaccine because BCG does not sufficiently prevent pulmonary disease.

ASC-2 binds to many nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner through its two LxxLL motifs. Here we show that the first LxxLL motif of ASC-2 shows relatively weak but specific interaction with the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and that ASCOM plays crucial roles in FXR transactivation. Our results reveal that ASC-2, MLL3, and MLL4 are recruited to FXR target genes in a ligand-dependent manner. We further show that the recruitment of MLL3 requires ASC-2 and that FXR ligand induces not only expression of FXR-target genes but also their H3K4 trimethylation in a manner dependent on the presence of ASC-2, MLL3, and MLL4. In addition, MLL3 and MLL4 function redundantly with FXR transactivation. Correspondingly, expression of FXR target genes is partially impaired in mice expressing an enzymatically inactivated mutant form of MLL3, and these mice show disrupted bile acid homeostasis. Overall, these results suggest that ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4 play redundant but essential roles in FXR transactivation via their H3K4 trimethylation activity.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Bile Acids and Salts</MeSH><MeSH>DNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Hep G2 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase</MeSH><MeSH>Homeostasis</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Receptor Coactivators</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Binding</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear</MeSH><MeSH>Response Elements</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptional Activation</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>MLL3 ASCOM complex</QueryUsed><Result PMID="19221051"><Journal>Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)</Journal><Year>2009</Year><Title>Crucial roles for interactions between MLL3/4 and INI1 in nuclear receptor transactivation.</Title><Abstract>Nuclear receptor (NR) transactivation involves multiple coactivators, and the molecular basis for how these are functionally integrated needs to be determined to fully understand the NR action.

Here, we show that ASCOM requires a functional cross talk with the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling complex Swi/Snf for efficient NR transactivation. Our results reveal that ASCOM and Swi/Snf are tightly colocalized in the nucleus and that ASCOM and Swi/Snf promote each other's binding to NR target genes. We further show that the C-terminal SET domain of MLL3 and MLL4 directly interacts with INI1, an integral subunit of Swi/Snf. Our mutational analysis demonstrates that this interaction underlies the mutual facilitation of ASCOM and Swi/Snf recruitment to NR target genes.

The expression levels of miR-129-5p in liver cancer tissues and cells were, respectively, determined. Crystal violet staining and flow cytometry were used to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to test cell migration and invasion. The target gene of miR-129-5p was analyzed and verified by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Tumorigenicity assays in nude mice were used to test the antitumor ability of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4). miR-129-5p was found to be underexpressed in hepatocellular cancer tissues and cells and also to inhibit liver cells proliferation, migration, and invasion and promote apoptosis. CAMK4 was a direct target for miR-129-5p and was lowly expressed in liver cancer tissues and cells. CAMK4 was also found to inhibit liver cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis. CAMK4 might exert an antitumor effect by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). MiR-129-5p was a tumor suppressor with low expression in liver cancer tissues and cells. CAMK4, which is a direct target gene of miR-129-5p, could inhibit tumor by inhibiting the activation of MAPK signaling pathway.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>effects CAMK4 inhibition</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31978801"><Journal>International immunopharmacology</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals a potential role for CaMK4 in &#947;&#948;T17 cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients with lupus nephritis.</Title><Abstract>&#947;&#948; T cells may be involved in the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) though the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The activity of ALAS2 was found altered and possibly related to a defect in the biogenesis of its co-substrate, the succinyl-CoA. Thus, the patient exhibits both a very low ferrochelatase activity without any accumulation of porphyrins precursors in contrast to what is reported in erythropoietic protoporphyria with solely impaired ferrochelatase activity. A significant oxidative stress was evidenced by decreased reduced glutathione and aconitase activity, and increased MnSOD protein expression. This oxidative stress depleted and damaged mtDNA, decreased complex I and IV activities and depleted ATP content. Collectively, our study demonstrates the key role of GLRX5 in modulating ALAS2 and ferrochelatase activities and in maintaining mitochondrial function.</Abstract><MeSH>5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase</MeSH><MeSH>Aconitate Hydratase</MeSH><MeSH>Adolescent</MeSH><MeSH>Amino Acid Sequence</MeSH><MeSH>Anemia, Sideroblastic</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Transformed</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Ferrochelatase</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Diseases, X-Linked</MeSH><MeSH>Glutaredoxins</MeSH><MeSH>Glutathione</MeSH><MeSH>Heme</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Mitochondria</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation, Missense</MeSH><MeSH>Oxidative Stress</MeSH><MeSH>Pedigree</MeSH><MeSH>Protein Structure, Tertiary</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Recently, treatment with monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors has emerged as an effective alternative, generating effective results with few side effects. In recent years, several clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies presented potential benefits to NSCLC, and 4 of them are already approved for the treatment of NSCLC, such as cetuximab, bevacizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Also, biological inhibitors are attractive tolls for biological applications. Among the approved inhibitors are crizotinib, erlotinib, afatinib and gefitinib, and side effects are usually mild to intense. Nevertheless, biological molecule treatments are under development, and several new monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors are in trial to treat NSCLC. Also under trial study are as follows: anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies (nimotuzumab and ficlatuzumab), anti-IGF 1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (figitumumab), anti-NR-LU-10 monoclonal antibody (nofetumomab) as well as antibodies directly affecting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) molecule (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) (denosumab) or to polymerase enzyme (veliparib and olaparib). Among new inhibitors under investigation are poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (veliparib and olaparib) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (buparlisib). However, the success of immunotherapies still requires extensive research and additional controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefits and side effects.</Abstract><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal</MeSH><MeSH>Antineoplastic Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung</MeSH><MeSH>Clinical Trials as Topic</MeSH><MeSH>Drug Discovery</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunologic Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Immunotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Targeted Therapy</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

There remains a high interest in generating robust antibodies for vaccination as well as understand how pathogenic antibody responses develop in allergies and autoimmune disease. Generating robust antigen-specific antibody responses is not always trivial. In mouse models, it often requires multiple rounds of immunizations with adjuvant that leads to a great deal of variability in the levels of induced antibodies. One example is in mouse models of peanut allergies where more robust and reproducible models that minimize mouse numbers and the use of adjuvant would be beneficial. Presented here is a highly reproducible mouse model of peanut allergy anaphylaxis. This new model relies on two key factors: (1) antigen-specific splenocytes are adoptively transferred from a peanut-sensitized mouse into a na&#239;ve recipient mouse, normalizing the number of antigen-specific memory B- and T-cells across a large number of mice; and (2) recipient mice are subsequently boosted with a strong multivalent immunogen in the form of liposomal nanoparticles displaying the major peanut allergen (Ara h 2). The major advantage of this model is its reproducibility, which ultimately lowers the number of animals used in each study, while minimizing the number of animals receiving multiple injections of adjuvant. The modular assembly of these immunogenic liposomes provides relatively facile adaptability to other allergic or autoimmune models that involve pathogenic antibodies.</Abstract><MeSH>Allergens</MeSH><MeSH>Anaphylaxis</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Arachis</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Food Hypersensitivity</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunization</MeSH><MeSH>Immunoglobulin E</MeSH><MeSH>Liposomes</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Nanoparticles</MeSH><MeSH>Peanut Hypersensitivity</MeSH><MeSH>Reproducibility of Results</MeSH><MeSH>T-Lymphocytes</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Forty percent of coronavirus isolates from FIP tissues had an intact 3c gene, while 60% had mutations that truncated the gene product. The 3c genes of fecal isolates from healthy cats were always intact. Coronavirus from FIP diseased tissues consistently induced FIP when given either oronasally or intraperitoneally (i.p.), regardless of the functional status of their 3c genes, thus confirming them to be FIPVs. In contrast, fecal isolates from healthy cats were infectious following oronasal infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for FECVs. Only one in three cats shed FECV in the feces following i.p. infection, indicating that FECVs can replicate systemically, but with difficulty. FIPVs having a mutated 3c were not shed in the feces following either oronasal or i.p. inoculation, while FIPVs with intact 3c genes were shed in the feces following oronasal but not i.p. inoculation. Therefore, an intact 3c appears to be essential for intestinal replication.

Viral RNA was isolated at post mortem from the jejunum and liver of a cat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). A consensus sequence of the jejunum-derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Je) was determined from overlapping cDNA fragments produced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. RT-PCR products were sequenced by a reiterative sequencing strategy and the genomic RNA termini were determined using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR strategy. The FCoV C1Je genome was found to be 29,255 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. Comparison of the FCoV C1Je genomic RNA sequence with that of the laboratory strain FCoV FIP virus (FIPV) 79-1146 showed that both viruses have a similar genome organisation and predictions made for the open reading frames and cis-acting elements of the FIPV 79-1146 genome hold true for FCoV C1Je. In addition, the sequence of the 3'-proximal third of the liver derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Li), which encompasses the structural and accessory protein genes of the virus, was also determined. Comparisons of the enteric (jejunum) and non-enteric (liver) derived viral RNA sequences revealed 100% nucleotide identity, a finding that questions the well accepted 'internal mutation theory' of FIPV pathogenicity.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Cats</MeSH><MeSH>Coronavirus, Feline</MeSH><MeSH>DNA, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Feline Infectious Peritonitis</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Variation</MeSH><MeSH>Genome, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Jejunum</MeSH><MeSH>Liver</MeSH><MeSH>Molecular Sequence Data</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Replicase</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Viral</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Both bortezomib and next-generation proteasome inhibitors mediate their effects by targeting the 20S core particle of the 26S proteasome. The novel small molecule inhibitor b-AP15 affects upstream elements of the ubiquitin-proteasome cascade by suppressing the deubiquitinase activity of both proteasomal regulatory 19S subunits and showed promising anticancer activity in preclinical models. Nonetheless, effects of inhibitors on the ubiquitin-proteasome system are not exclusively restricted to malignant cells: alteration of natural killer cell-mediated immune responses had already been described for drugs targeting either 19S or 20S proteasomal subunits. Moreover, it has been shown that bortezomib impairs dendritic cell (DC) phenotype and function at different levels. In the present study, we comparatively analyzed effects of bortezomib and b-AP15 on monocyte-derived DCs. In line with previous results, bortezomib exposure impaired maturation, antigen uptake, migration, cytokine secretion and immunostimulation, whereas treatment with b-AP15 had no compromising effects on these DC features. Our findings warrant the further investigation of b-AP15 as an alternative to clinically approved proteasome inhibitors in the therapy of malignancies, especially in the context of combinatorial treatment with DC-based immunotherapies.</Abstract><MeSH>Apoptosis</MeSH><MeSH>Bortezomib</MeSH><MeSH>Cell Line, Tumor</MeSH><MeSH>Dendritic Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Deubiquitinating Enzymes</MeSH><MeSH>Enzyme Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Monocytes</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Piperidones</MeSH><MeSH>Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex</MeSH><MeSH>Proteasome Inhibitors</MeSH><MeSH>Ubiquitin</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

The inactivation event occurs early in development in all cells of the female mouse embryo and is stable and heritable in somatic cells. However, in the primordial germ cells, reactivation occurs around the time of meiosis. Owing to random inactivation in somatic cells, all female mice and humans are mosaic for X-linked gene function. Variable mosaicism can result in expression of disease in human females heterozygous for an X-linked gene defect. In the extra-embryonic lineages of female mouse embryos, and in the somatic cells of female marsupials, the paternally inherited X chromosome is preferentially inactivated. The X chromosomes in the egg and sperm must be differentially marked or imprinted, so that they are distinguished by the inactivation mechanism in these tissues. Initiation of inactivation of an entire X chromosome appears to spread from a single X-inactivation centre and may involve the recently discovered gene, XIST, which is expressed only from the inactive X chromosome. The maintenance of inactivation of certain household genes on the inactive X chromosome involves methylation of CpG islands in their 5' regions. Critical CpG sites are methylated at, or very close to, the time of inactivation in development. The mouse and the human X chromosomes carry the same genes but their arrangement is different and there are some genes in the pairing segment and elsewhere on the human X chromosome which can escape inactivation. Regions of homology between the mouse and human X chromosomes allow prediction of the map positions of homologous genes and provide mouse models of genetic disease in the human.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Disease Models, Animal</MeSH><MeSH>Dosage Compensation, Genetic</MeSH><MeSH>Embryonic and Fetal Development</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Diseases, Inborn</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Methylation</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Mosaicism</MeSH><MeSH>Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid</MeSH><MeSH>X Chromosome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>mouse gene's chromosomal position</QueryUsed><Result PMID="12052840"><Journal>Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)</Journal><Year>2002</Year><Title>Conserved synteny in rat and mouse for a blood pressure QTL on human chromosome 17.</Title><Abstract>Evidence for blood pressure quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on rat chromosome 10 has been found in multiple independent studies. Analysis of the homologous region on human chromosome 17 revealed significant linkage to blood pressure. The critical segment on human chromosome 17 spans a large interval containing the genes Itga2b, Gfap, and Itgb3. Therefore, findings in the rat may help to refine the position of blood pressure-regulating loci, assuming a common molecular cause across species. However, it has recently been suggested that the gene order in human, rat, and mouse is not conserved in this region, leaving uncertainty about the overlap of the blood pressure- regulating region between human chromosome 17 and rat chromosome 10. We have performed a detailed comparative analysis among human, mouse, and rat, defining the segment in question, by obtaining gene structure information in silico and by radiation hybrid mapping. It is of interest that this region also contains Wnk4, a gene previously identified to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II and human hypertension.

This approach is illustrated for the effect of the male specific part (nonpseudoautosomal region; NPAR) of the mouse Y chromosome on offense. It is proposed that a positional candidate for this effect is Sry. The Sry protein is a transcription factor. Its mRNA is expressed in fetal and adult brain. Its protein binds to response elements in the 5' end of the aromatase and the Fra1 genes. Each of these genes has potential effects on several brain neurotransmitter systems involved in offense. The NPAR Y chromosomes of several pairs of inbred strains have differential effects on offense. This hypothesis would be tested by sequencing Sry for some of these pairs of strains.</Abstract><MeSH>Aggression</MeSH><MeSH>Agonistic Behavior</MeSH><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Brain</MeSH><MeSH>DNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Genotype</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mice</MeSH><MeSH>Nuclear Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>Sex-Determining Region Y Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Species Specificity</MeSH><MeSH>Transcription Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Y Chromosome</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Translational studies with mGlu5 modulators have relied on mGlu5 allosteric site positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands to assess receptor occupancy in the brain. However, recent structural and modeling studies suggest that closely related mGlu5 allosteric modulators can bind to overlapping but not identical sites, which could complicate interpretation of in vivo occupancy data, even when PET ligands and drug leads are developed from the same chemical scaffold. We now report that systemic administration of the novel mGlu5 positive allosteric modulator VU0092273 displaced the structurally related mGlu5 PET ligand, [(18)F]FPEB, with measures of in vivo occupancy that closely aligned with its in vivo efficacy. In contrast, a close analog of VU0092273 and [(18)F]FPEB, VU0360172, provided robust efficacy in rodent models in the absence of detectable occupancy. Furthermore, a structurally unrelated mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator, VU0409106, displayed measures of in vivo occupancy that correlated well with behavioral effects, despite the fact that VU0409106 is structurally unrelated to [(18)F]FPEB.

High-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), have rapidly advanced our understanding of oncology, and we are learning that most tumors do not simply possess consistently mutated genes that are responsible for tumorigenesis, facilitating the need for personalized cancer therapy. A T cell-dependent mechanism of cancer progression was discovered in 2012, providing a potential link to cancer immunotherapy. Since then, an antibody against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4), ipilimumab, and three programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab (Opdivo), and atezolizumab (Tecentriq), were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA. In this review article, based on evidence that has been emerging in the literature over the last decade, we will discuss the basis for including genomic data in immunotherapy regimens, the current progress in identifying biomarkers targetable by immune checkpoint blockade, and the application of these therapies in modern oncology programs. Going forward, the clinical application of NGS in personalized oncology programs could include dose monitoring and adjustment or the development of individualized vaccines or other personalized therapies based on&#160;the mutational landscape. The continued identification of new neoantigens and the efficient mobilization of tumor-reactive lymphocytes in patients with cancer will promote the advancement of immunotherapy using personalized NGS-guided technologies.</Abstract><MeSH>Genomics</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Precision Medicine</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

A subset of monocytes exposed to NETs ejected extracellular traps and this was shown to be mediated by proteins like elastase and citrullinated histones present in NET supernatant.

These breaks often result from DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or by treatment with anticancer drugs such as DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. Furthermore, DSBs are generated in the course of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. The unit presents strategies to distinguish radiation- or drug-induced DNA breaks from those intrinsically formed in untreated cells or associated with apoptosis. The protocol describes immunocytochemical detection of &#947;H2AX combined with measurement of DNA content to identify cells that have DNA damage and concurrently to assess their cell-cycle phase. The detection is based on indirect immunofluorescence using FITC- or Alexa Fluor 488-labeled antibody, with DNA counterstained with propidium iodide and cellular RNA removed with RNase A. &#169; 2019 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</Abstract><MeSH>Antineoplastic Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Apoptosis</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Fragmentation</MeSH><MeSH>Histones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunohistochemistry</MeSH><MeSH>Phosphorylation</MeSH><MeSH>Topoisomerase Inhibitors</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>breaks double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31309277"><Journal>European biophysics journal : EBJ</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Biophysical characterization and molecular phylogeny of human KIN protein.</Title><Abstract>The DNA/RNA-binding KIN protein was discovered in 1989, and since then, it has been found to participate in several processes, e.g., as a transcription factor in bacteria, yeasts, and plants, in immunoglobulin isotype switching, and in the repair and resolution of double-strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation.

Deregulation or deficiencies in BER mechanisms increase the level of mutations leading to carcinogenesis, and single-strand DNA break formation, which may be converted to double-strand breaks and induce apoptosis. BER deficiency is associated with development of diseases causing neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition, BER mechanisms can be affected by viral infections, such as HPV, HTLV-1, and HIV-1. Deficiencies in DNA repair in cells can be analyzed using a very convenient and effective approach, where mammalian cells are transfected with plasmids carrying a reporter gene of fluorescent protein that contain inactivating damages. The repair of DNA damages depends on the cellular machinery and is reflected by expression of the reporter gene measured by flow cytometry. In this chapter, we describe this plasmid-based reporter gene system to investigate in cell the repairs of DNA damages involving BER mechanisms.</Abstract><MeSH>Biological Assay</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>Flow Cytometry</MeSH><MeSH>Fluorescent Dyes</MeSH><MeSH>Genes, Reporter</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Vectors</MeSH><MeSH>Green Fluorescent Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>HCT116 Cells</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Plasmids</MeSH><MeSH>Transfection</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>breaks double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation</QueryUsed><Result PMID="21898661"><Journal>Human mutation</Journal><Year>2012</Year><Title>Variants in activators and downstream targets of ATM, radiation exposure, and contralateral breast cancer risk in the WECARE study.</Title><Abstract>Ionizing radiation (IR) is a breast carcinogen that induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and variation in genes involved in the DNA DSB response has been implicated in radiation-induced breast cancer. The Women's Environmental, Cancer, and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study is a population-based study of cases with contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and matched controls with unilateral breast cancer. The location-specific radiation dose received by the contralateral breast was estimated from radiotherapy records and mathematical models. One hundred fifty-two SNPs in six genes (CHEK2, MRE11A, MDC1, NBN, RAD50, TP53BP1) involved in the DNA DSBs response were genotyped. No variants or haplotypes were associated with CBC risk (649 cases and 1,284 controls) and no variants were found to interact with radiation dose. Carriers of a RAD50 haplotype exposed to &#8805;1 gray (Gy) had an increased risk of CBC compared with unexposed carriers (Rate ratios [RR] = 4.31 [95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.93-9.62]); with an excess relative risk (ERR) per Gy = 2.13 [95% CI 0.61-5.33]). Although the results of this study were largely null, carriers of a haplotype in RAD50 treated with radiation had a greater CBC risk than unexposed carriers. This suggests that carriers of this haplotype may be susceptible to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation therapy associated with radiation-induced breast cancer.</Abstract><MeSH>Breast Neoplasms</MeSH><MeSH>Case-Control Studies</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Mutational Analysis</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair</MeSH><MeSH>DNA Repair Enzymes</MeSH><MeSH>DNA-Binding Proteins</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Genetic Predisposition to Disease</MeSH><MeSH>Genotype</MeSH><MeSH>Haplotypes</MeSH><MeSH>Heterozygote</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Middle Aged</MeSH><MeSH>Mutation</MeSH><MeSH>Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced</MeSH><MeSH>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</MeSH><MeSH>Radiation Dosage</MeSH><MeSH>Radiotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Risk Factors</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>breaks double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32034200"><Journal>Scientific reports</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Quantification of DNA Double Strand Breaks and Oxidation Response in Children and Adults Undergoing Dental CBCT Scan.</Title><Abstract>Assessing the possible biological effects of exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the prime challenges in radiation protection, especially in medical imaging. Today, radiobiological data on cone beam CT (CBCT) related biological effects are scarce. In children and adults, the induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in buccal mucosa cells and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and antioxidant capacity in saliva samples after CBCT examination were examined. No DNA DSBs induction was observed in children nor adults. In children only, an increase in 8-oxo-dG levels was observed 30&#8201;minutes after CBCT. At the same time an increase in antioxidant capacity was observed in children, whereas a decrease was observed in adults. Our data indicate that children and adults react differently to IR doses associated with CBCT. Fully understanding these differences could lead to an optimal use of CBCT in different age categories as well as improved radiation protection guidelines.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Idiopathic toe-walking is estimated to occur in 7 to 24% of children. In order to address the problem of toe walking and assess improvements due to intervention, one needs to identify heel-toe gait versus toe-toe gait in natural environments of idiopathic toe walkers. The aim of this study was to investigate if learning algorithms utilizing triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes from wearable sensors could detect and differentiate heel-toe gait versus toe-toe gait. In this study, 5 adolescents (13&#177; 5 years) patients with idiopathic toe walking characteristics wore inertial sensor at L5 - S1 joint.

Idiopathic toe walking affects 5-12% of healthy children in the US. In the case of idiopathic toe walkers: typically, a child can heel-toe walk, but habitually walk on their toes. A corrective intervention is needed during the early age of a child. In this pilot study, we developed a wearable insole with tactile corrective feedback. A total of five subjects (13&#177;4 years) participated in this study. A customized insole was designed with two pressure sensors, inertial measurement units, a vibration tactor and on-board data storage SD card. A vibration biofeedback was provided to the participants if three consecutive toe-toe strikes were found while walking. We found that the average proportion of heel to toe strikes was 0%,66%,64%,53% and 67 % among participants. We also found median time of return to habitual walk of toe-toe gait was 13 seconds. All analysis was conducted on a walking data ranging from 2 to 20 hours of walking. All five subjects reported that the customized insoles were helpful and motivated them for a corrective gait. This novel research with wearable sensors will help physical therapists to utilize innovative intervention methods for gait training in idiopathic toe walkers.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Ofatumumab and siponimod will be approved probably in 2021. Ofatumumab is an ant-CD20 human monoclonal antibody. A clinical trial revealed that the efficacy of ofatumumab is clearly superior to teriflunomide that has comparable efficacy to dimethyl fumarate. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, exhibited mild, but significant efficacy for secondary progressive form of MS. OCH, a synthetic glycolipid agent, is being tested in phase II clinical trials in Japan. What DMD is to select is challenging since MS prognosis varies and is unexpected. Only very few have truly benign course without treatment. Silent progression should be considered especially in cases with those with interferon &#946;-1a, interferon &#946;-1b and gratiramer acetate. Escalation therapy is more widely accepted than initiation of high efficacy therapy in Japan because emphasizing safety. In such strategy three injectables and dimethyl fumarate are regarded as first line therapies. On the other hand, initiation of high efficacy drugs may be reasonable to prevent from disease progression. Even if either is acceptable, early induction of DMD with sufficient efficacy is mandatory for MS treatment.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

These radioprotective agents can be classified into two broad groups, depending upon the presence or absence of a free or potentially free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been studied extensively and are thought to exert their radioprotective effects by several mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and hydrogen atom donation. Several non-sulfhydryl-containing amino acids are also being investigated for their radioprotective effects. These agents are less well known than the familiar sulfhydryl compounds, but possess very interesting protective qualities. In short, the study of amino acids and their derivatives as radioprotective agents continues to contribute to an understanding of processes involved in radiation toxicity and to offer new compounds with potential application to situations of human exposure. </Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>radioprotection agents</QueryUsed><Result PMID="31677733"><Journal>Neuroimaging clinics of North America</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Introduction to Diagnostic and Therapeutic Spinal Angiography.</Title><Abstract>This article describes the basic principles of diagnostic and therapeutic spinal angiography as practiced by the author, including catheterization and radioprotection techniques, the selection of endovascular devices and embolization agents, and procedural complications.</Abstract><MeSH>Angiography</MeSH><MeSH>Central Nervous System Vascular Malformations</MeSH><MeSH>Embolization, Therapeutic</MeSH><MeSH>Endovascular Procedures</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Spinal Cord</MeSH><MeSH>Treatment Outcome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>radioprotection agents</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32254387"><Journal>Journal of materials chemistry.

Currently, there is no ideal and safe radioprotective agent available and we are seeing a great effort to find these agents from natural sources. Phenolic compounds, as well as flavonoid, are presented widely as the second metabolite in plants and they have been considered for investigation according to their benefits for human health, healing and preventing many disorders. The major bioactive benefits of flavonoids include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-aging, anti-bacterial and viral, neuroprotection and radioprotective effects. Their lower toxicity and oral administration have made it suitable for radiotherapy patient, radiation, military forces, and even the general public. This review attempts to provide a summary of the main molecular mechanisms involved in flavonoid radio-protective effects. Data of these studies will provide a comprehensive perspective to flavonoids and can help to optimize their effects in radioprotection procedures.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Most patients with MG require induction therapy with high doses of corticosteroids and maintenance with an immunosuppressant. Severe cases and acute worsening require intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis before oral immunosuppressants start having an effect. However, biologics are emerging as important therapeutic tools that promise to provide better corticosteroid sparing effects than standard treatments and can even induce remission. In particular, eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against complement C5, has been approved by the FDA for refractory MG on the basis of a phase III trial. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes peripheral B cells, has also been effective in many large uncontrolled series, although was not in a small phase III trial. Whether the newer anti-CD20 agents ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, ublituximab or inebilizumab will be more effective remains unclear. Belimumab, an antibody against the B cell trophic factor BAFF, was ineffective in phase III trials, and efgartigimod, which depletes antibodies, was effective in a phase II study. Some anti-cytokine agents relevant to MG immunopathogenesis also seem promising. Checkpoint inhibitors can trigger MG in some patients, necessitating early intervention. Increased availability of new biologics provides targeted immunotherapies and the opportunities to develop more specific therapies.</Abstract><MeSH>Biological Products</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunologic Factors</MeSH><MeSH>Immunosuppressive Agents</MeSH><MeSH>Immunotherapy</MeSH><MeSH>Myasthenia Gravis</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

Overexpression of MCL-1 is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis; thus, MCL-1 inhibitors are rational therapeutic options for malignancies depending on MCL-1. Several MCL-1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, including AZD5991, S64315, AMG 176, and AMG 397. A key area of investigation is whether MCL-1 inhibitors will complement the activity of BCL-2 inhibitors, such as venetoclax, and synergistically enhance anti-tumor efficacy when given in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.

In order to illustrate how population health can actively translate science into action, we consider primary care interventions that promote healthy populations by addressing the social determinants of health. In the examples provided in this article, primary care and population health are linked in a way that reinforces each other, and these innovative interventions may lead to improved health outcomes. Population health science provides a variety of methods and approaches for designing and evaluating interventions that aim to link patients with community resources that can address social determinants of health and improve the quality of their lives. Population health can serve as an important bridge between primary care and the public health sector. Population health science has been defined as "the study of the conditions that shape distributions of health within and across populations, and of the mechanisms through which these conditions manifest as the health of individuals" (Keys, K.M. 2016). According to this perspective, population health science elucidates the mechanisms that produce disease and the discipline of public health then applies that information to promote health in populations. Put another way, population health can be seen as the basic science of public health (Galea, S., et al. 2018). Other conceptions of population health have a direct concern with the translation of science into actions, and view science and action as linked and reinforcing each other (Kindig, D., et al. 2003; Diez Roux, A.V, 2016). For example, Kindig &amp; Stoddart (2003) differentiated population health from public health, health promotion, and social epidemiology and argued that "the field of population health includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two." The thesis of this commentary is that population health science goes beyond studying the mechanisms that shape distributions within and across populations to include actions that promote health of the entire human population. In support of this thesis, examples are provided from the literature on interventions in primary care that promote healthy populations by addressing the social determinants of health.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>promoter shape populations</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32388120"><Journal>Zoology (Jena, Germany)</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Sexual dimorphism in size and shape among populations of the lizard Sceloporus variabilis (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae).</Title><Abstract>Sexual dimorphism in lizards is determined by ecological and environmental factors. Broadly distributed species may show variation in patterns of sexual dimorphism toward either sex, as well as exhibiting variation in morphological dimensions. In the present study, sexual dimorphism in size and shape attributes was evaluated in three populations of the lizard Sceloporus variabilis from different environments in Mexico. We evaluated the size attributes of 10 morphological variables: snout-vent length (SVL), tibia length (TL), femur length (FeL), forearm length (FoL), interaxial distance (ID), head length (HL), head width (HW), head height (HH), jaw length (JL), and jaw width (JW). We also evaluated the attributes of shape (relative dimensions of the 10 morphological variables). In the size attribute, sexual dimorphism was found, with males being larger than females. In the case of shape, sexual dimorphism was found, with the females being larger in relative dimensions of ID and JW. Also, the males showed larger relative dimensions in TL, FeL and FoL. Differences were found between populations in the dimension of the variables analyzed in each sex. The pattern in size can be explained by sexual selection, where the males of each population maintain larger dimensions to compete for territory and access to females. In shape, females can be favored if they have larger relative ID and JW, as it promotes maintenance of clutch sizes, and use of microhabitats and different consumption of prey types than males. In the case of males, relative dimensions of TL, FeL and FoL may be functioning as important traits for escape from predators. The present study shows the importance of incorporating size and shape variables into analyses of sexual dimorphism among populations of a single species with a wide distribution. These types of studies help to identify the causes that promote sexual dimorphism, as well as the degree of difference among populations that inhabit different environments.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>promoter shape populations</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32388120"><Journal>Zoology (Jena, Germany)</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>Sexual dimorphism in size and shape among populations of the lizard Sceloporus variabilis (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae).</Title><Abstract>Sexual dimorphism in lizards is determined by ecological and environmental factors.

Broadly distributed species may show variation in patterns of sexual dimorphism toward either sex, as well as exhibiting variation in morphological dimensions. In the present study, sexual dimorphism in size and shape attributes was evaluated in three populations of the lizard Sceloporus variabilis from different environments in Mexico. We evaluated the size attributes of 10 morphological variables: snout-vent length (SVL), tibia length (TL), femur length (FeL), forearm length (FoL), interaxial distance (ID), head length (HL), head width (HW), head height (HH), jaw length (JL), and jaw width (JW). We also evaluated the attributes of shape (relative dimensions of the 10 morphological variables). In the size attribute, sexual dimorphism was found, with males being larger than females. In the case of shape, sexual dimorphism was found, with the females being larger in relative dimensions of ID and JW. Also, the males showed larger relative dimensions in TL, FeL and FoL. Differences were found between populations in the dimension of the variables analyzed in each sex. The pattern in size can be explained by sexual selection, where the males of each population maintain larger dimensions to compete for territory and access to females. In shape, females can be favored if they have larger relative ID and JW, as it promotes maintenance of clutch sizes, and use of microhabitats and different consumption of prey types than males. In the case of males, relative dimensions of TL, FeL and FoL may be functioning as important traits for escape from predators. The present study shows the importance of incorporating size and shape variables into analyses of sexual dimorphism among populations of a single species with a wide distribution. These types of studies help to identify the causes that promote sexual dimorphism, as well as the degree of difference among populations that inhabit different environments.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

Compared with the time-consuming and laborious experimental methods, more and more computational models are proposed to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. However, few models can effectively utilize the biological network topology of lncRNA (protein) and combine its sequence structure features, and most models cannot effectively predict new proteins (lncRNA) that do not interact with any lncRNA (proteins). In this study, we proposed a projection-based neighborhood non-negative matrix decomposition model (PMKDN) to predict potential lncRNA-protein interactions by integrating multiple biological features of lncRNAs (proteins). First, according to lncRNA (protein) sequences and lncRNA expression profile data, we extracted multiple features of lncRNA (protein). Second, based on protein GO ontology annotation, lncRNA sequences, lncRNA(protein) feature information, and modified lncRNA-protein interaction network, we calculated multiple similarities of lncRNA (protein), and fused them to obtain a more accurate lncRNA(protein) similarity network. Finally, combining the similarity and various feature information of lncRNA (protein), as well as the modified interaction network, we proposed a projection-based neighborhood non-negative matrix decomposition algorithm to predict the potential lncRNA-protein interactions. On two benchmark datasets, PMKDN showed better performance than other state-of-the-art methods for the prediction of new lncRNA-protein interactions, new lncRNAs, and new proteins. Case study further indicates that PMKDN can be used as an effective tool for lncRNA-protein interaction prediction.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>lncRNAs</QueryUsed><Result PMID="30936975"><Journal>Experimental and therapeutic medicine</Journal><Year>2019</Year><Title>Identification of lncRNA competitively regulated subpathways in myocardial infarction.</Title><Abstract>The functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in myocardial infarction (MI) remain largely unknown. Thus, we used the subp athway-LINCE method to characterize the potential roles of lncRNAs in MI. Candidate lncRNA-mRNA interactions were obtained from miRNA-mRNA interactions and lncRNA-miRNA interactions. Then the lncRNA and mRNA co-expression relationship pairs (LncGenePairs) were screened from the lncRNAs and mRNA intersections, which were extracted through candidate lncRNA-mRNA interactions and sample gene expression profiles. The lncRNAs in LncGenePairs were embedded into pathway graphs as nodes through linking to their regulated mRNAs, which resulted in obtaining condition-specific lncRNA competitively regulated signal pathways (csLncRPs). Finally, the csLncRPs were calculated using lenient distance similarity to obtain the lncRNA competitively regulated subpathways. Based on the statistical significance of signal subpathways, lncRNA-mRNA networks were constructed, in which hub lncRNAs were selected. A total of 65 lncRNAs competitively regulated subpathways and 13 hub lncRNAs were obtained, which associated with a risk of MI. Identifying lncRNAs competitively regulated subpathways not only provides potential lncRNA biomarkers for MI, but also helps the understanding of pathogenesis of MI.</Abstract></Result><QueryUsed>lncRNAs</QueryUsed><Result PMID="32533822"><Journal>Aging</Journal><Year>2020</Year><Title>LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles reveal the potential roles of lncRNA contributing to regulating dural penetration in clival chordoma.</Title><Abstract>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer originating from embryologic notochordal remnants.

Previous studies investigating the distribution of ACE2 mRNA in human tissues only involved a limited size of the samples and a lack of determination for ACE2 protein. Given the heterogeneity among humans, the datasets covering more tissues with a larger size of samples should be analyzed. Indeed, ACE2 is a membrane and secreted protein, while the expression of ACE2 in blood and common blood cells remains unknown. Herein, the proteomic data in HIPED and the antibody-based immunochemistry result in HPA were collected to analyze the distribution of ACE2 protein in human tissues. The bulk RNA-seq profiles from three separate public datasets including HPA tissue Atlas, GTEx, and FANTOM5 CAGE were also obtained to determine the expression of ACE2 in human tissues. Moreover, the abundance of ACE2 in human blood and blood cells was determined by analyzing the data in the PeptideAtlas and the HPA Blood Atlas. We found that the mRNA expression cannot reflect the abundance of ACE2 factor due to the strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities of ACE2 within and across tissues. Our results suggested that ACE2 protein is mainly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, gallbladder, and testis, while the abundance of which in brain-associated tissues and blood common cells is low. HIPED revealed enrichment of ACE2 protein in the placenta and ovary despite a low mRNA level. Further, human secretome shows that the average concentration of ACE2 protein in the plasma of males is higher than those in females. Our research will be beneficial for understanding the transmission routes and sex-based differences in susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</Abstract><MeSH>Betacoronavirus</MeSH><MeSH>Coronavirus Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Databases, Protein</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunohistochemistry</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Mass Spectrometry</MeSH><MeSH>Pandemics</MeSH><MeSH>Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A</MeSH><MeSH>Pneumonia, Viral</MeSH><MeSH>Proteomics</MeSH><MeSH>RNA, Messenger</MeSH><MeSH>RNA-Seq</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Virus</MeSH><MeSH>Tissue Distribution</MeSH><MeSH>Transcriptome</MeSH></Result><QueryUsed>tissues express ACE2 protein</QueryUsed><Result PMID="15949646"><Journal>Peptides</Journal><Year>2005</Year><Title>Organ-specific distribution of ACE2 mRNA and correlating peptidase activity in rodents.</Title><Abstract>Biochemical analysis revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme related carboxy-peptidase (ACE2) cleaves angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7), a heptapeptide identified as an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor Mas.

Although Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, previous studies indicate that its functions extend beyond regulating apoptosis. Mcl-1 is localized to both the mitochondrial outer membrane and matrix. Here, we have identified that Mcl-1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane mediates mitochondrial fission, which is independent of its anti-apoptotic function. We demonstrate that Mcl-1 interacts with Drp1 to promote mitochondrial fission in response to various challenges known to perturb mitochondria morphology. Induction of fission by Mcl-1 reduces nutrient deprivation-induced cell death and the protection is independent of its BH3 domain.

This review discusses the recent development in our understanding of the cell-intrinsic actions of biological factors linked to sex, sex hormones and sex chromosome complement, on immune cells, which may account for the sex differences in the enhanced susceptibility of women to develop immunological disorders, such as allergic asthma or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We choose to more specifically discuss the impact of sex hormones on the development and function of immune cell populations directly involved in type-2 immunity, and the role of the X-linked Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) in anti-viral immunity and in SLE. We will also elaborate on the recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in the immune cells of women, and how this may contribute to endow woman immune system with enhanced responsiveness to RNA-virus and susceptibility to SLE.</Abstract><MeSH>Animals</MeSH><MeSH>Asthma</MeSH><MeSH>Autoimmunity</MeSH><MeSH>Female</MeSH><MeSH>Gonadal Steroid Hormones</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Hypersensitivity</MeSH><MeSH>Immunity, Innate</MeSH><MeSH>Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic</MeSH><MeSH>Male</MeSH><MeSH>Microbiota</MeSH><MeSH>RNA Virus Infections</MeSH><MeSH>Receptors, Steroid</MeSH><MeSH>Sex Characteristics</MeSH><MeSH>Toll-Like Receptor 7</MeSH><MeSH>X Chromosome</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>

This field, called pharmacogenomics, is a key area in the development of precision oncology. Deep learning (DL) methodology has emerged as a powerful technique to characterize and learn from rapidly accumulating pharmacogenomics data. We introduce the fundamentals and typical model architectures of DL. We review the use of DL in classification of cancers and cancer subtypes (diagnosis and treatment stratification of patients), prediction of drug response and drug synergy for individual tumors (treatment prioritization for a patient), drug repositioning and discovery and the study of mechanism/mode of action of treatments.

In the presented paper, a GMP continuous wet granulation line for production of solid dosage forms was investigated. The line was composed of the subsequent continuous unit: operations feeding - twin-screw wet-granulation - fluid-bed drying - sieving and tableting. The formulation of a commercial entity was selected for this study. Several critical process parameters were evaluated in order to probe the process and to characterize the impact on quality attributes. Seven critical process parameters have been selected after a risk analysis: API and excipient mass flows of the two feeders, liquid feed rate and rotation speed of the extruder and rotation speed, temperature and airflow of the dryer. Eight quality attributes were controlled in real time by Process Analytical Technologies (PAT): API content after blender, after dryer, in tablet press feed frame and of tablet, LOD after dryer and PSD after dryer (three PSD parameters: x10 x50 x90). The process parameter values were changed during production in order to detect the impact on the quality of the final product. The deep learning techniques have been used in order to predict the quality attribute (output) with the process parameters (input). The use of deep learning reduces the noise and simplify the data interpretation for a better process understanding. After optimization, three hidden layers neural network were selected with 6 hidden neurons. The activation function ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and the ADAM optimizer were used with 2500 epochs (number of learning cycle). API contents, PSD values and LOD values were estimated with an error of calibration lower than 10%. The level of error allow an adequate process monitoring by DNN and we have proven that the main critical process parameters can be identified at a higher levelof process understanding. The synergy between PAT and process data science creates a superior monitoring framework of the continuous manufacturing line and increase the knowledge of this innovative production line and the products that it makes.</Abstract></Result></IR></Q>

In this context, a potential therapy should be brought to patients in the most expeditious way and early exploration of pharmacology is highly beneficial. Ozanezumab, a humanised IgG monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A protein which is an inhibitor of neurite outgrowth, is currently under development for the treatment of ALS and has been recently assessed in 76 patients in a first-in-human study. Inadequate target engagement has been recognised as a major contributing reason for drug trial failures. In this work, we describe the development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model using immunohistochemistry (IHC) data of co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle as a surrogate measure of target engagement. The rich plasma concentration data and the sparse IHC data after one or two intravenous doses of ozanezumab were modelled simultaneously using a non-linear mixed-effect approach. The final PKPD model was a two-compartment PK model combined with an effect compartment PD model that accounted for the delay in ozanezumab concentrations to reach the site of action which is skeletal muscle. Diagnostic plots showed a satisfactory fit of both PK and IHC data. The model was used as a simulation tool to design a dose regimen for sustained drug-target co-localization in a phase II study. </Abstract><MeSH>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</MeSH><MeSH>Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized</MeSH><MeSH>Biopsy</MeSH><MeSH>Computer Simulation</MeSH><MeSH>Dose-Response Relationship, Drug</MeSH><MeSH>Double-Blind Method</MeSH><MeSH>Humans</MeSH><MeSH>Immunohistochemistry</MeSH><MeSH>Models, Biological</MeSH><MeSH>Muscle, Skeletal</MeSH></Result></IR></Q>
